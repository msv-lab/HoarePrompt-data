In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the integer input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to control whether the loop executes.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
