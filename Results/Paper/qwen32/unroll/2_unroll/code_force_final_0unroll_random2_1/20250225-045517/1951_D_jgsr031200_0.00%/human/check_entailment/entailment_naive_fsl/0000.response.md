Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function Call Error**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is called inside the loop, but it is not defined within the scope of the provided code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic used in the function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins using at most 60 stalls. The current implementation only considers two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`, which is insufficient and incorrect for many cases.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, or vice versa, the program should be able to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls accordingly.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program should print "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices if it's possible, or "NO" if it's not possible.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that we can set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use binary search to find appropriate prices for the stalls. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_buy_exactly_k_jewels(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return "NO"
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_coins = n
    remaining_jewels = k
    
    for i in range(60):
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        price = remaining_coins // remaining_jewels
        if price == 0:
            break
        num_jewels = remaining_coins // price
        stalls.append(price)
        remaining_coins -= num_jewels * price
        remaining_jewels -= num_jewels
    
    if remaining_jewels == 0:
        return "YES\n{}\n{}".format(len(stalls), " ".join(map(str, stalls)))
    else:
        return "NO"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(can_buy_exactly_k_jewels(n, k))
```

This corrected version ensures that we can determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins, and it handles the output format correctly.
