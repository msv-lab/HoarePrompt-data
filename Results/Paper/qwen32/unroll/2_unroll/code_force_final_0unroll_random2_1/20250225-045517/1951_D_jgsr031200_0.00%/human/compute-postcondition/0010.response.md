The code snippet assigns a list to the variable `costs`. The list contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**
