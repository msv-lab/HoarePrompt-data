In the given initial state, we have two positive integers `n` and `k` such that `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}`, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is currently less than `k`. 

The Python code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is a direct string output and does not reference any variables.

Therefore, the output of the code is:
Output: **NO**
