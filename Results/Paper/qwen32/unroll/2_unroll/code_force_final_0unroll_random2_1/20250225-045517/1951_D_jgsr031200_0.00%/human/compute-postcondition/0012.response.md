In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the elements in the `costs` list. The loop head only involves the variable `i`, which is used to iterate over the elements of `costs`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `costs` list is properly defined for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.

The `costs` list is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which means it will always have at least two elements as long as `n` and `k` are such that `n - k + 1` is a positive integer. Since `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n - k + 1` will indeed be a positive integer.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the `costs` list to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute as long as `costs` is not empty, which it is not in this case.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0**.
