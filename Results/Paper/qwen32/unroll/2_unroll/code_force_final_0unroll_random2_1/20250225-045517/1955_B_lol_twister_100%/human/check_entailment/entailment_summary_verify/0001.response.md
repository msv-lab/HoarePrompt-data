Let's carefully analyze the provided code and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged to form a progressive square of size \( n \times n \).
- The progressive square is constructed using a starting value \( a_{1,1} \) (which is the minimum value in the list), and the values \( c \) and \( d \).
- The formula for the element at position \((k, h)\) in the progressive square is:
  \[
  a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h
  \]
  where \( a \) is the minimum value in the list, and \( k \) and \( h \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Finding the Minimum Value (`a`)**:
   ```python
   a = min(l)
   ```
   This correctly identifies the starting value \( a \) as the minimum value in the list `l`.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   ```python
   li = []
   for k in range(0, n):
       for h in range(0, n):
           li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
   ```
   This correctly generates the elements of the progressive square using the given formula.

3. **Sorting and Comparing**:
   ```python
   li.sort()
   l.sort()
   if l == li:
       return 'yes'
   return 'no'
   ```
   Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted, and the code checks if they are equal. If they are, it means the elements in `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the function returns "yes". Otherwise, it returns "no".

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (size of the matrix), `c` and `d` (integers), and `l` (a list of \( n^2 \) integers). It returns 'yes' if the list `l` can be rearranged to match a specific sequence generated based on the minimum value in `l` and the values of `c` and `d`; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Evaluation:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square based on the parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \). It efficiently constructs the expected elements of the progressive square and checks if the input list matches these elements when both are sorted. The steps and logic align perfectly with the problem description and the function summary.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Final:** **True**
