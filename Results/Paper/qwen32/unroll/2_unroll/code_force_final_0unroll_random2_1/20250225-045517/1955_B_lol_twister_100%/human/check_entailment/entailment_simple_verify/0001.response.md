### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the code and the annotations to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Finding the Minimum Value (`a`)**:
   - The code identifies the minimum value in the list `l` as `a`. This is a reasonable assumption because the problem states that the elements of the progressive square can be constructed based on a starting value `a_{1,1}`. However, the problem description does not specify that `a_{1,1}` must be the minimum value in the list `l`. Instead, `a_{1,1}` is a specific value provided by Maxim, which is not necessarily the minimum value in the list. The code assumes `a` to be `min(l)`, which might not always be the correct starting value `a_{1,1}`.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The code generates a list `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This correctly reflects the rules for constructing the progressive square if `a` were indeed the correct starting value `a_{1,1}`.

3. **Sorting and Comparing**:
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted. The code then checks if the sorted versions of `li` and `l` are equal. If they are, it means that the elements in `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Evaluation:

The main issue with the code is the assumption that the minimum value in the list `l` is the correct starting value `a_{1,1}`. The problem description specifies that `a_{1,1}` is a given value by Maxim, not necessarily the minimum value in the list. Therefore, the code might incorrectly identify the starting value, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it assumes the minimum value in the list `l` as the starting value `a_{1,1}` instead of using the correct starting value provided by Maxim.

**Final: **False**
