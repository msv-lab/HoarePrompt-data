You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the size of a matrix), `c` and `d` (integers), and `l` (a list of `n^2` integers). It returns 'yes' if the list `l` can be rearranged to match a specific sequence generated based on the minimum value in `l` and the values of `c` and `d`; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program assumes that the minimum value in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}`. However, this is not necessarily true. The value of `a_{1,1}` is not explicitly given but is determined by the rules of constructing the progressive square. The program does not correctly identify `a_{1,1}` based on the rules provided.

To construct the progressive square, we need to ensure that the values in the list `l` match the values generated by the formula `a_{1,1} + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The program should check all possible values for `a_{1,1}` to ensure that the list `l` can be rearranged to match the progressive square.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
3 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
For `n=3`, `c=2`, and `d=3`, the progressive square should be constructed with a specific `a_{1,1}`. If we assume `a_{1,1} = 1`, the progressive square would be:
```
1  4  7
3  6  9
5  8 11
```
But if we assume `a_{1,1} = 2`, the progressive square would be:
```
2  5  8
4  7 10
6  9 12
```
The given input list `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]` matches the second progressive square, but the program would incorrectly assume `a_{1,1} = 4` (the minimum value in the list) and generate:
```
4  6  8
6  8 10
8 10 12
```
which does not match the input list. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
