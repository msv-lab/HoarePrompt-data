### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can form a specific type of matrix called a "progressive square" based on the rules defined in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the matrix size `n`, and the parameters `c` and `d`.
   - It then reads a list `l` of `n * n` integers.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then constructs a list `li` of `n * n` integers, where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Both the constructed list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - If the sorted list `li` matches the sorted input list `l`, the program returns "YES", indicating that the list `l` can indeed form the specified progressive square.
   - Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Progressive Square Construction:**
  - The construction of the progressive square follows the rules given in the problem statement. The matrix is filled such that each element at position `(k, h)` is computed as `a + k * c + d * h`, which ensures that the matrix is progressive with the given parameters `a`, `c`, and `d`.

- **Verification of Input and Output:**
  - The program correctly reads inputs and outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether the input list can form the progressive square.
  - The sorting step ensures that the order of elements does not affect the comparison, as the problem does not specify any particular order for the elements in the input list `b`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately constructs the progressive square and compares it with the input list to determine if the input list can form the progressive square.

**Correctness: True**
