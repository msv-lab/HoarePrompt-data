Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program assumes that the minimum value in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}`. However, this is not necessarily true. The value of `a_{1,1}` is not explicitly given but is determined by the rules of constructing the progressive square. The program does not correctly identify `a_{1,1}` based on the rules provided.

To construct the progressive square, we need to ensure that the values in the list `l` match the values generated by the formula `a_{1,1} + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The program should check all possible values for `a_{1,1}` to ensure that the list `l` can be rearranged to match the progressive square.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
3 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
For `n=3`, `c=2`, and `d=3`, the progressive square should be constructed with a specific `a_{1,1}`. If we assume `a_{1,1} = 1`, the progressive square would be:
```
1  4  7
3  6  9
5  8 11
```
But if we assume `a_{1,1} = 2`, the progressive square would be:
```
2  5  8
4  7 10
6  9 12
```
The given input list `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]` matches the second progressive square, but the program would incorrectly assume `a_{1,1} = 4` (the minimum value in the list) and generate:
```
4  6  8
6  8 10
8 10 12
```
which does not match the input list. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
