### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

**Key Insight:**

The game revolves around the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have in their wallets. Here's why:

1. **Initial Setup:** Alice starts first, and both players have a choice to either swap their wallets or not, then they must take one coin from their current wallet.
2. **Optimal Play:** Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move to win.
3. **Winning Condition:** The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins) loses.

**Observation:**

- If the difference between `a` and `b` is **even**, Bob wins.
- If the difference between `a` and `b` is **odd**, Alice wins.

**Why?**

- When the difference is even, Alice will always leave Bob with an even difference after her turn, forcing Bob into a losing position if both play optimally.
- Conversely, when the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference, ensuring Alice's victory.

**Program Analysis:**

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
- It checks if the difference is even or odd.
  - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
  - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

The logic aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

**Correctness: True**
