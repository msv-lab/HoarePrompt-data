Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.**

In simpler terms, `t` now holds the number of test cases, and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
