### Reasoning

Let's systematically analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Breakdown

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns playing with two wallets containing `a` and `b` coins respectively. The players can either keep their current wallet or swap wallets, and then they must remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses.

#### Key Observations

1. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to win.
2. **Turn Order**: Alice goes first.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses.

#### Strategy

The game's outcome can be determined based on the difference between `a` and `b`:

- **Even Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`)**: If the difference is even, Alice will lose if both play optimally. This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is eventually forced to make the last move and lose.
- **Odd Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`)**: If the difference is odd, Alice can always win by making the difference remain odd after her first move. She can achieve this by swapping wallets if necessary, then removing a coin to make the difference odd. From there, she can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that she never faces a situation where both wallets are empty on her turn.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program correctly implements this logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It calculates the absolute difference between the two wallets.
- It checks if the difference is even or odd and prints the winner based on the analysis above.

#### Function Summary Evaluation

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program. It states that the program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `a` and `b`, calculates the absolute difference, and prints "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd. This aligns with the strategy derived from the problem analysis.

#### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies the winning strategy based on the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. The provided program accurately implements this strategy.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
