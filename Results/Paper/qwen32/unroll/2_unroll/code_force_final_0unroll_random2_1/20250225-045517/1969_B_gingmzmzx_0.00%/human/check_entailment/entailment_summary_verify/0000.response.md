### Reasoning:

The provided program `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost required to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. The approach taken by the program is based on counting inversions, which is a valid method for determining the minimum number of swaps (or shifts in this context) needed to sort a binary string.

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Inversions:**
   - It counts the total number of `0`s in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It maintains a count of the number of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far (`cnt`).
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to store the total cost.

3. **Calculating Cost:**
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is `0`, it adds `1` to the cost (`ans`) if there are any `1`s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This is because a `0` after a `1` is an inversion.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining `0`s to the cost (`zeroes - cnt[0]`). This accounts for the fact that each `1` needs to be shifted past all remaining `0`s.

### Verification Against Edge Cases:

1. **Already Sorted Strings:**
   - For strings like `"0000"` or `"1111"`, the program correctly identifies that no inversions are present, and thus the cost is `0`.

2. **Strings with Alternating Characters:**
   - For strings like `"101010"`, the program correctly counts the inversions. Each `1` after a `0` is an inversion, and the cost is calculated accordingly.

3. **Strings with All Zeros Followed by All Ones:**
   - For strings like `"000111"`, the program correctly identifies that no inversions are present, and thus the cost is `0`.

4. **Strings with All Ones Followed by All Zeros:**
   - For strings like `"111000"`, the program correctly counts the inversions. Each `1` needs to be shifted past all `0`s, and the cost is calculated accordingly.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

The provided examples in the problem statement are handled correctly by the program. The outputs match the expected results:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `"10"`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The string needs one cyclic shift to become `"01"`, which costs `2`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `"0000"`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The string is already sorted.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `"11000"`
  - Output: `9`
  - Explanation: The string needs multiple cyclic shifts to become `"00011"`, which incurs a total cost of `9`.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `"101011"`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The string needs multiple cyclic shifts to become `"000111"`, which incurs a total cost of `5`.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `"01101001"`
  - Output: `11`
  - Explanation: The string needs multiple cyclic shifts to become `"00001111"`, which incurs a total cost of `11`.

### Conclusion:

The program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. It handles various edge cases and the provided examples correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
