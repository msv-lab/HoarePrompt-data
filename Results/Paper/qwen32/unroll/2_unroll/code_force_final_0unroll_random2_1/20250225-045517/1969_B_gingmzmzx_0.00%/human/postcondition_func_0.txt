The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the specific logic applied to the binary string. The function does not accept any direct parameters but reads input from standard input. It outputs an integer for each test case, representing the result of the calculation performed on the corresponding binary string.
