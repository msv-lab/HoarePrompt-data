The provided code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and that there are `t` test cases, each with a binary string `s`. The value of `n` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is introduced by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `n` is an input integer.**
