Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Logic for Choosing the Path:**
   - The program attempts to find the point where it can switch from the top row to the bottom row to minimize the lexicographical order. However, it only considers the first occurrence where `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`. This is not sufficient to ensure that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest.
   - For example, consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     5
     01010
     00100
     ```
     The program might choose the path `00100` by switching at the first opportunity, but the lexicographically smallest path is actually `00010` by switching later.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of paths that yield the smallest string, but the logic is flawed. It only considers the first path found and does not correctly account for all possible paths that yield the same smallest string.
   - For example, consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3
     00
     00
     ```
     The program will output `000` and `2`, which is correct. However, if the grid is:
     ```
     1
     3
     01
     01
     ```
     The program might output `001` and `1`, but the correct answer should be `001` and `2` because there are two paths that yield the smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the smallest string is entirely in one row. For example:
     ```
     1
     3
     000
     111
     ```
     The program should output `000` and `1`, but it might not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
