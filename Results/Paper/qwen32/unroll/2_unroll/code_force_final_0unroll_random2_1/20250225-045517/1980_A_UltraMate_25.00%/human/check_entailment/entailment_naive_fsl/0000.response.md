Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the difficulty level 'G' correctly. The problem description specifies that the difficulties of the problems can be 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. However, the program only considers 'A' to 'F' and ignores 'G'. This means that if the required number of 'G' difficulty problems is not met, the program will not account for it, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
10 1
GGGGGGGGGG
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

Actual Output:
```
6
```

This test case seems to work because there are no 'A' to 'F' problems, and the program does not account for 'G'. However, consider another test case:

Input:
```
1
10 1
ABCDEFGF
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

In this case, the program does not recognize the presence of 'G' and incorrectly assumes that one more problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'F' is needed, resulting in an incorrect output of `1` instead of `0`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the missing handling of the 'G' difficulty level.
