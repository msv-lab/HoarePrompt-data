Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of changes required to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. Characters 'G' and any missing characters from 'A' to 'F' are not considered in the count.**
