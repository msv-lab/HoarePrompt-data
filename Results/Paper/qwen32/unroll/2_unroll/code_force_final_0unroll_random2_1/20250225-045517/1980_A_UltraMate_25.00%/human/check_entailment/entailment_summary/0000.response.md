### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level from 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times across `m` rounds.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by a string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to count the number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates through each difficulty level from 'A' to 'F'. If a particular difficulty level is not present in the string `s`, it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need at least one problem of that difficulty level.
   - For each difficulty level that is present, if its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - count)` to `ans` to ensure that there are enough problems for all `m` rounds.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated value of `ans` for each test case.

The main issue with the program is that it does not consider the difficulty level 'G'. According to the problem description, Vlad needs one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G' for each round. However, the program only considers levels 'A' to 'F' and ignores 'G'. This leads to incorrect results when the input includes problems of difficulty 'G'.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for the difficulty level 'G', which is a required difficulty level for each round according to the problem description.
