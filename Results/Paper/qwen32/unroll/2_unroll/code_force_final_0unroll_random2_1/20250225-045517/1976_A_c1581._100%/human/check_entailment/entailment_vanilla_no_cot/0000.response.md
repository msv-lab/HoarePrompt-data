Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical flaw in the `func_1` function. Specifically, it does not correctly check the condition that all letters should come before any digits in the password, and that after each letter, there should either be another letter or the string should end. The program only checks that the digits and letters are individually sorted and that the last digit is not greater than any letter, but it does not ensure that no digit appears after a letter.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_digit = False
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit():
            seen_digit = True
        if seen_digit and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return False
        if i < len(password) - 1 and password[i].isdigit() and password[i] > password[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(password) - 1 and password[i].isalpha() and password[i] > password[i + 1]:
            return False
    if len(password) > 1 and password[-2].isdigit() and password[-1].isalpha():
        return False
    return True
```

This function iterates through the password and checks the following:
1. Once a digit is seen, no letter should appear after it.
2. Digits should be in non-decreasing order.
3. Letters should be in non-decreasing order.

With this corrected function, the program should work as expected.
