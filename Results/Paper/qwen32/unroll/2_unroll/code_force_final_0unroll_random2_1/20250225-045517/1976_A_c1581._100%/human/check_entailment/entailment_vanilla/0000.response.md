Let's break down the problem requirements and the provided program to determine if the program correctly implements the solution.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Character Set**: The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Ordering of Characters**:
   - No digit should come after a letter. This implies that all letters should appear before any digits in the password.
   - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the password length and the password string. It then calls the function `func_1(password)` to determine if the password is strong. Here is a step-by-step analysis of `func_1(password)`:

1. **Separation of Characters**:
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates through each character in the password. If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list; otherwise, it appends it to the `letters` list.

2. **Sorting**:
   - It sorts both `digits` and `letters` lists.

3. **Validation**:
   - It iterates through the `digits` list and checks if they are in non-decreasing order. This check is redundant because the list is already sorted.
   - It then checks if the last digit is less than or equal to every letter in the `letters` list. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.
   - Finally, it constructs a `sortedPassword` string by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and compares it to the original password. If they match, it means the original password was already sorted according to the rules, and the function returns `True`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the condition that no digit should come after a letter. The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect because it only compares the last digit with the first letter, not ensuring that no digit precedes any letter.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the password contains only letters or only digits, as it would still attempt to access `digits[-1]` which would cause an error if `digits` is empty.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the solution, we need to ensure that:
- All letters appear before any digits.
- Digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    if digits and letters and password.index(digits[0]) < password.index(letters[-1]):
        return False
    return digits == sorted(digits) and letters == sorted(letters)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Correctness: **False**
