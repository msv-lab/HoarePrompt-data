Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The for loop statement is:
```
for i in range(len(digits)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, the only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `i` and `digits`. The loop will execute if `len(digits)` is greater than 0, meaning that the `digits` list must contain at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20.
- `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password`, sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password`, sorted in non-decreasing order.

To ensure the loop can execute, `digits` must have at least one element. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized to 0 before the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted such that the `digits` list is not empty.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing at least one digit character from the `password`, sorted in non-decreasing order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password`, sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is 0**
