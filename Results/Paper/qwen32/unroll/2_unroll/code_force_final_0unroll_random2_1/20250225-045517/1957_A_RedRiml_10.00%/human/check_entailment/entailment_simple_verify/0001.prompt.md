You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from a given set of sticks, where each polygon must have at least 3 sides (since a polygon with fewer than 3 sides is not a polygon), and each stick can be used in at most one polygon.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Determining Polygon Formation:**
   - The program iterates through the unique stick lengths stored in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`), it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `shapes`, which represents the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Counting Polygons:**
  - The program only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length and counts each such occurrence as one polygon.
  - However, a regular polygon with `k` sides requires `k` sticks of the same length. The program does not account for this and does not check if the number of sticks is a multiple of the number of sides of the polygon.
  - For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 3, the program would count only one polygon, but it could actually form two triangles (polygons with 3 sides).

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. It fails to account for the fact that polygons with more than 3 sides can be formed and does not correctly count the number of polygons based on the number of sticks available.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
