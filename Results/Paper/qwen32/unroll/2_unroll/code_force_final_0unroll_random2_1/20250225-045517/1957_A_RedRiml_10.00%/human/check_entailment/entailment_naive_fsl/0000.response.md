Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed simultaneously. The current implementation only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length and counts each such length as one polygon, which is incorrect. 

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation: We can form one square using four sticks of length 3.

However, the provided program will output `2` because it counts both the sticks of length 2 and the sticks of length 3 as separate polygons, even though only one polygon can be formed from the sticks of length 3.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by considering the number of sides required for each polygon (at least 3) and ensuring we use the sticks efficiently. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            # Calculate the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with sticks of length j
            shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we count the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using the available sticks of each length.
