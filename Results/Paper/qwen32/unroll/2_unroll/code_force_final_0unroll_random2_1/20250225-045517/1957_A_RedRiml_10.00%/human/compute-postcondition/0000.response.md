The provided code snippet only reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `w`. This integer represents the number of test cases. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `w` (1 ≤ `w` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.**
