To determine the output state, we need to understand what the given code does. The code processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it counts how many different stick lengths appear at least three times and prints that count.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Input Reading:** For each test case, the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are read.
2. **Counting Stick Lengths:** A dictionary (`d`) is used to count the occurrences of each stick length. A list (`pl`) keeps track of unique stick lengths.
3. **Counting Shapes:** For each unique stick length, if it appears at least three times, the `shapes` counter is incremented.
4. **Output:** The number of stick lengths that appear at least three times is printed.

Given this understanding, the output state will be a series of integers, each representing the number of stick lengths that appear at least three times for each test case.

Since the output state is dependent on the specific input values for each test case, we cannot provide a concrete output state without the input values. However, we can describe the output state in a general format.

Output State: **For each test case, an integer representing the number of stick lengths that appear at least three times.**

If we hypothetically had specific input values, we could calculate the exact output. For example, if the input was:
```
2
5
1 2 2 3 3
6
1 1 1 2 2 2
```
The output would be:
```
1
2
```
This is because in the first test case, only the length `2` and `3` appear twice, so none appear at least three times. In the second test case, both lengths `1` and `2` appear exactly three times.

Without specific input values, we can only describe the output state in a general manner as mentioned above.

Thus, the final answer in the required format is:
Output State: **For each test case, an integer representing the number of stick lengths that appear at least three times.**
