You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.

    #State: `R` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the input. The variables `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, and `r` will have values determined by the last iteration of the loop, but these are not specified as they depend on the input provided during execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines and returns a pair of indices from a given permutation such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized. It interactsively queries up to 3n times by providing four indices to receive comparison results of bitwise OR operations on the elements of the permutation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(p\) is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). The program is allowed to ask up to \(3n\) queries to the judge to compare bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation \(n\).

2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The program initializes `g` to 0 and `v1` to 0 (although `g` is not used).
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\), comparing \(p_{v1} \mid p_{v1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) (which is effectively \(p_i\) since \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\)). Since \(p_i\) is unique and ranges from 0 to \(n-1\), this is essentially comparing \(p_{v1}\) with \(p_i\).
   - If the result of the comparison is `<`, it means \(p_i\) is greater than \(p_{v1}\), so it updates `v1` to `i`. By the end of this loop, `v1` will hold the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Element**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) again, comparing \(p_{v1} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\).
   - If the result of the comparison is `>`, it means \(p_i\) is a better candidate for the second maximum element when XORed with \(p_{v1}\), so it updates `prev` to `i`. By the end of this loop, `prev` will hold the index of the element that maximizes \(p_{v1} \oplus p_i\).

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - The program prints `! prev v1`, which are the indices of the two elements whose XOR is maximized.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum.
- It then finds the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the maximum possible result.
- The total number of queries made is \(2(n-1)\), which is well within the limit of \(3n\) queries.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
