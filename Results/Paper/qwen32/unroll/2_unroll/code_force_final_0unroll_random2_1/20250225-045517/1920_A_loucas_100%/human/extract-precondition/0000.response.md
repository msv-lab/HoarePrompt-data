Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines where each line contains two integers a (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). Here, a = 1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a = 2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a = 3 means k must not be equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases.**
