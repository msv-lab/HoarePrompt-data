constraints is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of constraints. This is followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint: if a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x; if a=2, k must be less than or equal to x; if a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
