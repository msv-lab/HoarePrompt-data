The code `num_up = s.count('U')` counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `num_up`. The string `s` remains unchanged. The length of the string `s` is still a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 100.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing the initial state of the coins on the table, where 'U' indicates a coin facing up and 'D' indicates a coin facing down; `num_up` is the count of 'U' characters in `s`.**
