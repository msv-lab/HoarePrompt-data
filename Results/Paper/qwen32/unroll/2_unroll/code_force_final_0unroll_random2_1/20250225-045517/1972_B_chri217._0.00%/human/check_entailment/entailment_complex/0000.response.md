### Reasoning:

The game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. The key insight is that:

- If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of 'U' coins is even when it's Bob's turn. Since Bob will always face an even number of 'U' coins, he will eventually be unable to make a move when all 'U' coins are removed, making Alice the winner.
- Conversely, if the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where the number of 'U' coins is odd when it's Alice's turn. Eventually, Alice will be unable to make a move, making Bob the winner.

The provided code correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' coins in the string `s` and checking if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win. If the count is even, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
