Output State: **The function `func()` has processed all test cases. For each test case, it has determined and printed the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` in the form "! i j". The state of variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `i` within the loop body are reset for each new test case, but the function is ready to process the next test case if there are any. The external system's state regarding the test cases and permutations is unchanged except for the queries made and results received.**
