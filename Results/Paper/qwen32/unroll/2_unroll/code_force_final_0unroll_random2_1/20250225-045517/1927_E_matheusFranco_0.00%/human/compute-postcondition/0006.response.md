To understand the output state, let's break down the provided code and see how it modifies the initial state.

The loop is structured as follows:
- The outer loop runs `k` times.
- For each iteration `i` of the outer loop, the inner while loop fills the `permutation` list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with the current value `curr_v`, then increments `curr_v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n, and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is 1.

Let's walk through the iterations:

1. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
   - The inner while loop will fill the `permutation` list at positions `0, k, 2k, 3k, ...` with `curr_v` (starting from 1).
   - After this iteration, `curr_v` will be incremented accordingly to the number of elements filled.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - The inner while loop will fill the `permutation` list at positions `1, k+1, 2k+1, 3k+1, ...` with `curr_v` (starting from the last incremented value).

3. **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
   - The inner while loop will fill the `permutation` list at positions `2, k+2, 2k+2, 3k+2, ...` with `curr_v` (starting from the last incremented value).

This process continues until the `i` reaches `k-1`.

After all iterations, the `permutation` list will be filled with values starting from 1 in a specific pattern based on the multiples of `k` plus `i`.

Let's consider an example with `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
- The `permutation` list is initially `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- After the first iteration (i = 0), positions `0, 4, 8` will be filled with `1, 2, 3` respectively.
- After the second iteration (i = 1), positions `1, 5, 9` will be filled with `4, 5, 6` respectively.
- After the third iteration (i = 2), positions `2, 6` will be filled with `7, 8` respectively.
- After the fourth iteration (i = 3), position `3` will be filled with `9` respectively.

Thus, the `permutation` list will be `[1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 0, 3, 6]`.

Given the pattern and the process, the final output state can be generalized for any `n` and `k`:

Output State: **`permutation` is a list where positions `i, k+i, 2k+i, ...` are filled sequentially with `curr_v` starting from 1; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is the next integer after the last filled value in `permutation`.**

For a more specific example with `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
Output State: **`permutation` is `[1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 0, 3, 6]`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 10.**
