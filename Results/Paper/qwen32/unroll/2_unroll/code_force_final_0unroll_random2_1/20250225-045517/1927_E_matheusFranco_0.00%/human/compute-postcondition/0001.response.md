The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer, which means it can be any integer value. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `t` needs to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
