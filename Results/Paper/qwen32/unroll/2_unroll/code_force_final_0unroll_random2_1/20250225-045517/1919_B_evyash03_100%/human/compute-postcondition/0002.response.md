To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior. The loop iterates over each character in the `expression` string. If the character is '+', it increments the `count` variable by 1. 

Given that the initial state of `count` is 0, and it only increments when encountering a '+', the final value of `count` will be equal to the number of '+' characters in the `expression`.

Since the `expression` string and its length are provided in the initial state, but its specific content (the number of '+' characters) is not specified, we can only describe the final state in terms of the number of '+' characters in the `expression`.

However, for the sake of providing a concrete output state, let's assume we need to describe the state after the loop has processed a specific `expression`. If we don't have a specific `expression`, we can generalize the output state as follows:

Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000; count is the number of '+' characters in the expression.**

If we assume a specific `expression` for demonstration, let's say `expression = "++-++-"`, then the `count` would be 4 after the loop finishes.

Output State: **expression is "++-++-", and length is 6; count is 4.**

Since the problem does not specify a particular `expression`, the most accurate and general output state we can provide is:

Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000; count is the number of '+' characters in the expression.**
