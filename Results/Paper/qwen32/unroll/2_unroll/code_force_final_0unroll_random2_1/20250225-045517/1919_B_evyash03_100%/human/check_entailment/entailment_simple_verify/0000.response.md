### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues and verify the assessment step by step:

1. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It calls the `func_1` function with the string and its length.
   - Inside `func_1`, it counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
   - It calculates `sub` as the number of '-' characters (i.e., `length - count`).
   - It returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters.

2. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - According to the problem statement, the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - Instead, it simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not align with the penalty calculation described.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     ++--
     ```
   - The program will count 2 '+' and 2 '-' characters.
   - It will then calculate `sub` as `4 - 2 = 2`.
   - The absolute difference between `sub` and `count` is `|2 - 2| = 0`.
   - The output will be `0`.

   However, the correct way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it into `([1, 1], [-1, -1])`, which gives a penalty of `|1+1|*2 + |-1-1|*2 = 4`.

4. **Verification with Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly state the program's behavior at key points.
   - The annotations confirm that the program simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
