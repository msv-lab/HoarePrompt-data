Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for the given problem. The function `func_1` only calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not guarantee the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. This is evident from the example cases where the program's output does not match the expected minimum penalty. Specifically, in the fourth and fifth test cases, the program's output is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal splitting strategy that minimizes the total penalty.

Final: **False**
