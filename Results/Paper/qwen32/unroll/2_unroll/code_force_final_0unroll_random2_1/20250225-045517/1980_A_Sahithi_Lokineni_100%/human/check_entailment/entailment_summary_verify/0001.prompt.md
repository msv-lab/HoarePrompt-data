You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    d['A'] = 0
    d['B'] = 0
    d['C'] = 0
    d['D'] = 0
    d['E'] = 0
    d['F'] = 0
    d['G'] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] <= m:
            ans = ans + m - d[val]
    print(ans)

def func_1():
    return 0



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of additional problems needed to hold `m` rounds, where each round requires one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
2. **Inputs**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of problems in the bank.
     - `m`: Number of rounds.
     - `a`: A string of `n` characters representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read from input, representing the number of test cases.
   - A `defaultdict` named `d` is initialized with a default value function `default_value`, which is not defined in the provided code. This should be a function that returns 0, but it's not necessary as we explicitly set all values to 0 later.
2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
   - A string `s` of length `n` is read, representing the difficulties of the problems.
3. **Counting Difficulties**:
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the string `s`.
4. **Calculating Additional Problems**:
   - For each difficulty level, if the count of problems is less than `m`, the difference (`m - count`) is added to `ans`, which represents the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level.
5. **Output**:
   - The total number of additional problems needed for all difficulty levels is printed for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The `default_value` function is referenced but not defined. However, since the counts are explicitly set to 0 for all difficulty levels, this is not a critical issue.
- The logic for calculating the additional problems is correct. For each difficulty level, if there are fewer than `m` problems, the difference is added to `ans`.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases by decrementing `t` and processing each test case in a loop.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description and examples.
