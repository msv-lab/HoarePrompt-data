In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is any non-zero integer.

Given that the initial state specifies `t` as an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `t` is already guaranteed to be a non-zero integer. This means the loop can certainly execute one time without any modifications to the state of `t`.

Thus, we do not need to adjust any states. The state right before the loop is already suitable for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
