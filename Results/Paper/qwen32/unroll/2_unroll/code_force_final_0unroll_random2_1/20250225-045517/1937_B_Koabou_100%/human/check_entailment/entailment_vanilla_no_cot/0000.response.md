Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**:
   - The program attempts to find a path by comparing the next cell in the first row with the current cell in the second row. This approach does not guarantee finding the lexicographically smallest path. The logic for choosing the path is flawed and does not handle all edge cases.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**:
   - The program incorrectly counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. The counting logic is dependent on the flawed path selection and does not correctly handle all scenarios.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not properly handle cases where the grid consists entirely of zeros or ones. It also does not correctly handle cases where the smallest path involves switching rows multiple times.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The print statement for the string `s` includes `sep=''`, which is unnecessary since `s` is already a string. However, this is a minor issue compared to the logic errors.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to explore all possible paths and keep track of the lexicographically smallest path.
- Count the number of paths that result in this smallest path.

Here is a high-level outline of a correct approach:
1. Use a dynamic programming table to store the lexicographically smallest path and the number of ways to reach each cell.
2. Initialize the starting point (top-left cell) and iterate through each cell, updating the smallest path and the count of paths.
3. Ensure that the path is built by considering both possible moves (right or down) and choosing the one that results in the lexicographically smallest path.
4. Output the smallest path and the count of paths that result in this path.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct implementation would be more involved than the provided code.
