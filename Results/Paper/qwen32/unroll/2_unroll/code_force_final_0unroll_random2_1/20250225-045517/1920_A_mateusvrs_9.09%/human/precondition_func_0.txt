There are multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is described by two integers a and x, where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
