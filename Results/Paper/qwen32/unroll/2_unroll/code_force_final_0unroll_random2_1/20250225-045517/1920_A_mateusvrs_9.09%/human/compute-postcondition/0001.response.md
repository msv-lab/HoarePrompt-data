The provided Python code snippet only initializes an empty list `r`. It does not modify any other variables or execute any logic that would change the initial state of the test cases or their constraints. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `r`.

Output State: **There are multiple test cases, each starting with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is described by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9. If `a`=1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`. If `a`=2, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`. If `a`=3, `k` must be not equal to `x`. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `r` is an empty list.**
