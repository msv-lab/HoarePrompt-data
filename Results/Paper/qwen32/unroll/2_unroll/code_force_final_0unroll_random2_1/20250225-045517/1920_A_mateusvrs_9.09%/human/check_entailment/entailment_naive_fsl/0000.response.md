Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in the handling of constraints. Specifically, the condition `if bx >= ax:` is incorrect because it should be `if bx > ax:`. The current implementation will incorrectly return 0 whenever `bx` equals `ax`, even though there might be valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints in this case.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

- `bx` is the maximum of all constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).
- `ax` is the minimum of all constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
- If `bx > ax`, it means there are no integers that can satisfy both types of constraints simultaneously, so the answer should be 0.
- However, if `bx == ax`, it means there is exactly one integer `k` that satisfies both types of constraints, and it should be checked against the constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
3
1 5
2 5
3 6
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- k must be greater than or equal to 5.
- k must be less than or equal to 5.
- k must not be equal to 6.

The only integer that satisfies all constraints is 5. However, the current code will return 0 because `bx` (5) is equal to `ax` (5), and it does not correctly handle this case.

To fix the code, the condition `if bx >= ax:` should be changed to `if bx > ax:`, and an additional check should be added to handle the case when `bx == ax`.

Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        elif bx == ax:
            if bx in cx:
                r.append(0)
            else:
                r.append(1)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

This corrected code properly handles the case when `bx == ax` and ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
