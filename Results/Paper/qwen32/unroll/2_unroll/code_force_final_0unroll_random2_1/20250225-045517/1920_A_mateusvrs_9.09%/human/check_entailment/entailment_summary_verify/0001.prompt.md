You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines the number of possible integer values `k` can take that satisfy all given constraints and outputs this count. If no such `k` exists, it outputs 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Constraints Types:**
   - Type 1: `k >= x`
   - Type 2: `k <= x`
   - Type 3: `k != x`
2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case.
3. **Guarantees:**
   - There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2.
   - No two constraints are the same.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it initializes:
  - `cx`: A set to store values for type 3 constraints (values `k` cannot be).
  - `ax`: A variable to track the minimum value for type 2 constraints (initially set to a large number).
  - `bx`: A variable to track the maximum value for type 1 constraints (initially set to a small number).
- It then reads each constraint and updates `ax`, `bx`, or `cx` accordingly.
- After processing all constraints for a test case, it checks if `bx >= ax`:
  - If true, it means there is no possible `k` that satisfies both type 1 and type 2 constraints, so it appends `0` to the results.
  - If false, it calculates the number of valid `k` values in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of values in `cx` that fall within this range.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Range Check:**
  - The condition `if bx >= ax` is incorrect. It should be `if bx > ax` to correctly identify impossible ranges. The current condition will incorrectly return `0` when `bx == ax`, which is a valid single value for `k`.
- **Range Calculation:**
  - The range calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is correct, assuming `bx < ax`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, the condition `if bx >= ax` should be changed to `if bx > ax`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect range check condition.

Correctness: **False**
