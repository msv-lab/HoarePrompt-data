You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. Each of the m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i where a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. All pairs of friends (a_i, b_i) are distinct. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        sum_f = 0
        
        for j in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        
        p = p // gcd
        
        q = q // gcd
        
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the result of the computation for each test case, formatted as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here, `n` is the number of people, `m` is the number of friendships, and `k` is a threshold value. It also receives `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing a friendship between person `a_i` and person `b_i` with a friendship factor `f_i`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs, but the specific output criteria are not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
