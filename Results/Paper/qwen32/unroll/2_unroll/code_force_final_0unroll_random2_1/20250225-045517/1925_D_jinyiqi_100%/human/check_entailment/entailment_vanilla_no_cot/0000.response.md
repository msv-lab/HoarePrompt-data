Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of the friendship values for the given problem. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula used in the program to calculate `p` and `q` is incorrect. The expected value calculation involves the probability of selecting a friend pair and the increase in friendship values over time, which is not accurately captured by the current formula.
   - The formula for `p` and `q` should take into account the probability of selecting a friend pair and the contribution of each friend pair's increasing friendship value over the `k` excursions, which is not done here.

2. **Handling of Friend Pairs:**
   - The program does not correctly account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases each time it is selected. The current approach sums the initial friendship values and then attempts to adjust for the expected number of times each pair is selected, which is not correctly implemented.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability of selecting a friend pair in each excursion is `m / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. This probability should be used to calculate the expected increase in the sum of friendship values, but the provided program does not use this probability correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to calculate the expected contribution of each friend pair to the sum of friendship values over the `k` excursions, taking into account the probability of selecting each pair and the increase in friendship values. This involves a more complex calculation than what is currently implemented in the program.
