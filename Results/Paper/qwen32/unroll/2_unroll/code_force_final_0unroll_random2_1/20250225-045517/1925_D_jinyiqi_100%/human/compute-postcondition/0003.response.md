To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the variables.

The loop iterates `t` times, each time reading values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. For each test case, it calculates a value `p` and `q` and then prints the result of `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the computation for each test case:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `n`: Number of people.
   - `m`: Number of friendship pairs.
   - `k`: Some multiplier.
   - For each of the `m` lines, read `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` which denote a friendship between `a_i` and `b_i` with some feature `f_i`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - `sum_f`: Sum of all `f_i` values.

3. **Computation of `p` and `q`:**
   - `cn2`: Number of possible pairs of people, calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `p`: Calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - `q`: Calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

4. **Simplification and Modulo Operation:**
   - `gcd`: Greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
   - `p` and `q` are divided by `gcd` to simplify the fraction.
   - The final result is computed as `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`, where `pow(q, -1, M)` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`.

5. **Output:**
   - The result of the above computation is printed.

The loop does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` outside its body. After each iteration, the results are printed and do not affect the state of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` for subsequent iterations.

The output state will be the series of results printed for each test case, one per line.

**Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the result of the computation for each test case, formatted as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.**

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the friendship pairs are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical output. However, the format of the output state is clearly defined by the computation inside the loop.
