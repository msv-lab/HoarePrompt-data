### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The key points are:
- There are `n` children and `m` pairs of friends.
- Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
- The teacher randomly chooses a pair of children for each of `k` excursions.
- If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen, expressed as a fraction `p/q`, and return `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code calculates `p` and `q` as follows:
\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

Let's break down the components:
- \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
- `sum_f` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
- The formula seems to account for the expected contribution of the initial friendship values and the additional contributions due to the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The original assessment suggests that the formula used in the code is incorrect. However, let's verify this by considering the expected value calculation step-by-step.

1. **Initial Contribution**:
   - The initial friendship value contributes to the sum directly.
   - The expected contribution of each friend pair in the first excursion is its initial value `f_i`.
   - The total initial expected contribution is `sum_f`.

2. **Subsequent Contributions**:
   - For each subsequent excursion, the chosen friend pair's friendship value increases by 1.
   - The probability of choosing a specific friend pair in any given excursion is `1 / \binom{n}{2}`.
   - The expected number of times a specific friend pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / \binom{n}{2}`.
   - The expected additional contribution from a friend pair over `k` excursions is `f_i * (k / \binom{n}{2}) + (k / \binom{n}{2}) * ((k - 1) / \binom{n}{2}) * 1 + ... + (k / \binom{n}{2}) * ((k - (k - 1)) / \binom{n}{2}) * (k - 1)`.
   - Simplifying, the expected additional contribution per friend pair is `f_i * (k / \binom{n}{2}) + (k / \binom{n}{2}) * (k - 1) / 2`.
   - Summing over all `m` friend pairs, the total expected additional contribution is `sum_f * (k / \binom{n}{2}) + m * (k / \binom{n}{2}) * (k - 1) / 2`.

3. **Total Expected Value**:
   - The total expected value is the sum of the initial and additional contributions.
   - The formula provided in the code seems to match this calculation when simplified.

Given the above reasoning, the formula used in the code appears to be correct. The original assessment might have overlooked the correct derivation of the expected value formula.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
