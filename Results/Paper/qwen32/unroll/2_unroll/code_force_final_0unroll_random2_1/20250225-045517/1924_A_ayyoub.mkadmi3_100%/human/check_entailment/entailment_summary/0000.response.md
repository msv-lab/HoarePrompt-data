### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and the execution summary.

The program's main objective is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. If not, it should provide a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program calls `func_1(s, k, n)` which processes the string `s`.
   - `func_1`:
     - Initializes an empty string `s1` to collect characters from `s` that are in the first `k` alphabets.
     - Initializes an empty string `s2` to collect characters that caused a reset condition.
     - Creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` alphabets.
     - Iterates over each character `i` in `s`:
       - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it removes `i` from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element.
       - If `alphabet` has only one element, it appends `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to contain the first `k` alphabets.
       - Appends `i` to `s1`.
     - Calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
     - Returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence and appends 'No' and this string to `OUT`.
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `True`, it appends 'Yes' to `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints all elements in `OUT`.

### Issues in the Program:

The program contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function's logic for determining if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s` is flawed. The current logic does not correctly check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.
   - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Incorrect Construction of the Missing String:**
   - The logic to construct a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence is incorrect. The program simply appends characters not in `s1` to `s2` and then constructs a string based on `s2`, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the logic of `func_1` and the incorrect construction of the missing string, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
