Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Objective**: Check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the string `s`.
2. **Output**: If all subsequences are present, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO" and provide a string of length `n` that is missing.

### Program Analysis
The program uses a function `func_1` to check the presence of all possible subsequences. Let's break down the function and the main logic.

#### Function `func_1(s, k, n)`
- **Purpose**: Determine if `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- **Logic**:
  - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
  - Iterates through the string `s` and removes characters from the alphabet set as they appear.
  - If the alphabet set becomes empty, it resets the set and appends the current character to `s2`.
  - It constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the initial alphabet set.
  - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
  - Returns a tuple:
    - A boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
    - A substring of `s1` starting from `r * k`.
    - The string `s2` which seems to be a concatenation of characters when the alphabet set becomes empty.

#### Main Logic
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
- Calls `func_1` to check if `s` contains all subsequences.
- If `func_1` returns `False`:
  - It tries to find a character that is not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using this character.
  - Prints "NO" and the constructed string.
- If `func_1` returns `True`:
  - Prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly check for all possible subsequences. Instead, it seems to be checking for the presence of all characters in a specific pattern.
   - The function does not ensure that all combinations of characters of length `n` are present as subsequences in `s`.

2. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence**:
   - The program attempts to find a missing subsequence by looking for a character not in `s1`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid missing subsequence.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the required logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
