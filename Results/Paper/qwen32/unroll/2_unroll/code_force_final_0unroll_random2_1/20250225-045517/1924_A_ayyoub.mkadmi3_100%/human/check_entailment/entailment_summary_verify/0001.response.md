### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Analysis

The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`. If not, we need to find and print one such string that does not appear as a subsequence.

#### Key Points
- **Subsequence**: A string `a` is a subsequence of `b` if all characters of `a` appear in `b` in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.
- **Possible Strings**: There are `k^n` possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- **Output**: Print "YES" if all possible strings appear as subsequences; otherwise, print "NO" followed by a string that does not appear as a subsequence.

#### Program Analysis

Let's carefully examine the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Main Loop
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.
- It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.

#### Function `func_1(s, k, n)`
- It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- It iterates over each character in `s` and updates the alphabet set and strings `s1` and `s2`.
- It checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a tuple containing this check result, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`.

#### Output Generation
- If `func_1` returns `True`, the program appends "YES" to the output list.
- If `func_1` returns `False`, the program appends "NO" and attempts to find a string of length `n` that does not appear as a subsequence.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` appear as subsequences in `s`.
   - The logic for constructing `s1` and `s2` and the alphabet set does not ensure that all possible subsequences are considered.

2. **Finding a Non-Subsequence String**:
   - The logic to find a string that does not appear as a subsequence is incorrect. It simply checks for the first missing character and constructs a string, which does not guarantee that this string will not be a subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is large or `k` is small, leading to incorrect results.

### Detailed Analysis

Let's break down the function `func_1` and its logic:

```python
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)
```

- **Initialization**: The alphabet set is correctly initialized with the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- **Iteration**: The function iterates over each character in `s`.
- **Alphabet Update**: If the character is in the alphabet set, it is removed from the set. If the set becomes empty, it resets the set and appends the character to `s2`.
- **String Construction**: `s1` accumulates characters, and `s2` accumulates characters when the alphabet set resets.
- **Return**: The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Checking Subsequences**:
   - The function does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - The length of `s1` being at least `n * k` does not guarantee that all possible subsequences are present.

2. **Finding a Non-Subsequence String**:
   - The logic to find a non-subsequence string is flawed. It simply constructs a string using the first missing character, which may still be a subsequence.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem:
1. **Check Subsequences**: Use a different approach to check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
2. **Find a Non-Subsequence String**: Use a systematic approach to generate and check strings of length `n` against `s`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the logic of `func_1` and the method to find a non-subsequence string, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
