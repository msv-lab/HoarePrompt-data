Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is the length of the string `a`; `m`, which is the minimum number of times each character type ('A' to 'G') should appear in the string; and `a`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns `needed_problems`, which is the total number of additional problems required to ensure each character type ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times in the string `a`.**
