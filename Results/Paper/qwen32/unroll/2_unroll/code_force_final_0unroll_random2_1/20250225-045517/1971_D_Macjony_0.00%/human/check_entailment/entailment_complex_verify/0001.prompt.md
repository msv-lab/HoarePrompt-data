You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a single binary string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the number of segments of consecutive identical characters in the binary string `s`, minus one if there is at least one '0' followed by a '1', is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` binary strings. For each binary string, it calculates the number of segments of consecutive identical characters and subtracts one if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1'. It then prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of pieces a binary string can be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string is one where all '0's come before all '1's. The pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string, and all pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case and processes the binary string `s` as follows:
1. It initializes `count` to 1, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed. This is because, in the worst case, we would need to cut the string into individual pieces.
2. It uses a flag `flag` to check if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
3. It iterates through the string, and whenever it encounters a transition (i.e., `s[j] != s[j + 1]`), it increments the `count`.
4. If the transition is from '0' to '1' (`s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`), it sets `flag` to `True`.
5. After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1. This is the key logic to determine the minimum number of pieces.

### Correctness Analysis:
The logic is based on the observation that the minimum number of pieces required is equal to the number of transitions plus one, minus one if there is at least one '0' followed by a '1' somewhere in the string. This is because:
- Each transition from '0' to '1' indicates that we need to cut the string to separate the '0's from the '1's.
- If there is at least one '0' followed by a '1', we can rearrange the pieces such that all '0's are together and all '1's are together, and thus we can reduce the number of pieces by one.

Let's verify this with the example cases:
1. `11010`: Transitions are at indices 1, 2, and 3. `count` becomes 4, and since there is a '0' followed by a '1', we decrement `count` to 3.
2. `00000000`: No transitions, `count` remains 1.
3. `1`: No transitions, `count` remains 1.
4. `10`: One transition, `count` becomes 2.
5. `0001111`: One transition, `count` becomes 2, but since there is a '0' followed by a '1', we decrement `count` to 1.
6. `0110`: Transitions are at indices 0 and 2. `count` becomes 3, and since there is a '0' followed by a '1', we decrement `count` to 2.

The program correctly handles all these cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the minimum number of pieces needed for each test case based on the provided logic.
