Precondition: **Each test case consists of three integers n, k, and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n) representing the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
