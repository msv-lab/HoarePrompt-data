t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a list of integers a and two integers n, k, and x. For each tuple, n is the length of the list a such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, k and x are integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and a is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
