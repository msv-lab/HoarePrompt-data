You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 <= `k_i` <= 20.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a product of the integers in `k`, then replaces each integer in `k` with the product divided by that integer. If the sum of these new values is greater than or equal to the original product, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the modified list `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
We need to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Specifically, if the multiplier for a winning outcome is \( k_i \), and we bet \( x_i \) coins on it, then the total bet \( \sum x_i \) must satisfy \( \sum x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for each \( i \).

### Analysis of the Program
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the following approach:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers, `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Assigning Bets:**
   - For each outcome \( i \), it assigns the bet as \( x_i = \frac{\text{prod}}{k_i} \).
   - It calculates the total bet as the sum of all \( x_i \).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the total bet \( \sum x_i \) is greater than or equal to `prod`, it outputs `-1` (indicating no valid distribution).
   - Otherwise, it outputs the bets \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \).

### Evaluation of the Program

Let's consider the logic behind the program:
- The program assigns each bet \( x_i \) as the product of all multipliers divided by the current multiplier. This ensures that \( k_i \cdot x_i = \text{prod} \) for each \( i \).
- The condition \( \sum x_i < \text{prod} \) is necessary to ensure that the total bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

However, there is a critical flaw in this approach:
- The program does not guarantee that the total bet \( \sum x_i \) will be strictly less than `prod` for all cases. In fact, it is impossible to guarantee this for all sets of multipliers.
- For example, if all multipliers are the same, the product `prod` will be \( k^n \), and each bet \( x_i \) will be \( k^{n-1} \). The total bet will be \( n \cdot k^{n-1} \), which is not necessarily less than \( k^n \) (in fact, it is equal when \( n \geq 2 \)).

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It fails to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome for all possible sets of multipliers.

Therefore, the Correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
