Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program does not guarantee that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
2. It then sets each bet to `prod // a[i]`.
3. It checks if the sum of these bets is greater than or equal to `prod`. If it is, it outputs `-1`.
4. Otherwise, it outputs the bets.

However, this approach does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1 1 1
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- If we bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total bet is 3 coins.
- If the first outcome wins, we receive 2 * 1 = 2 coins back (which is not enough).
- If the second outcome wins, we receive 2 * 1 = 2 coins back (which is not enough).
- If the third outcome wins, we receive 2 * 1 = 2 coins back (which is not enough).

However, the program will calculate `prod = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8` and then set each bet to `8 // 2 = 4`. The total bet is `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`, which is greater than the amount received back for any winning outcome (which would be 8 coins).

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly and will output incorrect results for such inputs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
