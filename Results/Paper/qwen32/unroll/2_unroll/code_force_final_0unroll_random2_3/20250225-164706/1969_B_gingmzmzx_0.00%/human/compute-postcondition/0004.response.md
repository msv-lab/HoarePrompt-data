Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each binary string, it calculates a specific value based on the arrangement of '0's and '1's in the string and prints this value. The function handles multiple test cases, where the total number of test cases is provided as input, and the length of each binary string is between 2 and 200,000 characters.**
