### Reasoning:

The provided program `func_1` is intended to compute the minimum cost required to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The program processes each binary string independently and calculates a cumulative cost based on the number of '1's encountered before '0's and vice versa.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. **Counting Operations:**
   - The variable `zeroes` counts the total number of '0's in the string.
   - The list `cnt` keeps track of the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` accumulates the cost.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '0', the cost is incremented by 1 if there are any '1's encountered before this '0'. This is because a '0' can be brought to the front by shifting the substring containing the '1's to its right.
     - If the character is '1', the cost is incremented by the number of '0's that have not yet been encountered. This is because each '1' can be moved to the end by shifting the substring containing the preceding '0's to its left.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach correctly accounts for the minimum cost required to sort the string based on the described operations.
   - The cost is calculated efficiently in a single pass through the string, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to compute the minimum cost for sorting each binary string.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
