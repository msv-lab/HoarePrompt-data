Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the described cyclic shift operation. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to count the number of operations needed to move all '1's to the end of the string, but it does not account for the cost of each operation correctly or handle the cyclic nature of the shifts.

The program calculates a value `ans` based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered, but this does not reflect the actual cost of performing the cyclic shifts. The cost is defined as the length of the substring being shifted, and the program does not calculate this cost for any operations it might be attempting to simulate.

A correct approach would involve identifying segments of the string that need to be shifted and calculating the cost of shifting those segments to achieve a sorted string. The given program does not implement such a method.
