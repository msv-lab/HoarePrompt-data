The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of participants and their order in screenshots taken by different participants. For each test case, it determines whether there is a consistent order of participants such that the order in each screenshot can be derived by swapping two participants at most once. It outputs 'yes' if such a consistent order exists and 'no' otherwise.
