Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} such that 1 <= a_{ij} <= n, representing the order of participants seen in the screenshot posted by participant a_{i0} where a_{i0} is the first element in the i-th line and is always at the top of the list. All authors of the screenshots are different.**
