Correctness: **False**

The provided program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the input string `s`. While this approach might work in some cases, it does not guarantee that a different permutation will be generated, especially for strings with repeated characters. For example, if the input string is "aaaaa", all permutations generated by `random.sample` will be identical to the original string, and the program will incorrectly output "NO" for such cases.

To ensure correctness, the program should implement a method that guarantees a different permutation if possible. One way to do this is to find the next lexicographical permutation of the string, or to swap characters in a deterministic manner while ensuring the resulting string is different from the original.
