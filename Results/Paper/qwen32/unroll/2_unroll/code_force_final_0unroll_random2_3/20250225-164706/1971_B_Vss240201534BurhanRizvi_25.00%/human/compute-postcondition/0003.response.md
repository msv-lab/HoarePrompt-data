Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string `s` can be rearranged into a different permutation. If it can, the function prints "Yes" followed by one such permutation; otherwise, it prints "No". This process is repeated `t` times.**
