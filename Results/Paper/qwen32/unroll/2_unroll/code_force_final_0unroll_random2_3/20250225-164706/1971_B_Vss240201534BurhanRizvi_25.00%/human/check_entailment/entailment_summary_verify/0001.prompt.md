You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string `s` can be rearranged into a different permutation. If it can, the function prints "Yes" followed by one such permutation; otherwise, it prints "No". This process is repeated `t` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using the `random.sample` function to generate a random permutation of the input string `s`. If the randomly generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by the new string `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No". 

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Randomness and Efficiency**: The program relies on randomness to generate a different permutation. This is inefficient and not guaranteed to work quickly, especially for strings with many repeated characters (like "aaaaa" or "hhhhhhhhhh"). In the worst case, it could theoretically run indefinitely if it keeps generating the same permutation repeatedly.

2. **Correctness for Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the input string consists of all identical characters (like "aaaaa"), any permutation of this string will be the same as the original string, and the program should always output "No" for such cases. The current implementation might incorrectly output "Yes" due to the reliance on randomness.

3. **Deterministic Approach**: A more reliable and efficient approach would be to check if there is at least one pair of different characters in the string. If such a pair exists, we can swap them to form a new string that is different from the original. If no such pair exists (i.e., all characters are the same), we should output "No".

Given these points, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
