To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the provided code snippet:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. **String Input**: For each iteration, a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters is read.
3. **String Shuffling**: The string `s` is shuffled using `random.sample(s, len(s))`, which generates a new string `s2` that is a permutation of `s`.
4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If `s` is not equal to `s2`, it prints "Yes" and the shuffled string `s2`.
   - If `s` is equal to `s2` (which is unlikely but possible if `s` consists of all identical characters), it prints "No".

Given the above, the output state will be a series of "Yes" or "No" followed by the shuffled string `s2` if applicable, repeated `t` times.

Since the output is dependent on the random shuffling and the input strings, we cannot predict the exact strings `s2` that will be printed. However, we can describe the format and the possible outcomes.

Output State: **A series of "Yes" or "No" printed `t` times, with "Yes" followed by a shuffled version of the input string `s` if `s` is not equal to its shuffled version.**

In a more structured format as requested:

Output State: **A series of "Yes" or "No" printed `t` times, with "Yes" followed by a shuffled version of the input string `s` if `s` is not equal to its shuffled version.**
