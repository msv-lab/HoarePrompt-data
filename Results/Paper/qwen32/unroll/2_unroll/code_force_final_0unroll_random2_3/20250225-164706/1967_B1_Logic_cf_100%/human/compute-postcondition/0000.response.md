The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user, representing the number of test cases.**
