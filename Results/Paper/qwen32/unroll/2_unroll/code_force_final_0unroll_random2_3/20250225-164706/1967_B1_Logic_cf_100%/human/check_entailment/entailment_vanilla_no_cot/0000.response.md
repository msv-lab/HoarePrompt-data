Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The condition that needs to be satisfied is that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided program incorrectly adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the answer for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, which does not account for the gcd condition and the range of `a`.

Here is a brief explanation of why the provided program is incorrect and what needs to be done:

1. For each pair `(a, b)`, the program needs to check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
2. The current program incorrectly assumes that `(n + b) // (b * b)` will give the correct count of valid `a` values for each `b`, which is not the case.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition directly, or using a more mathematical approach to count valid pairs efficiently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

However, this naive approach would be too slow for the given constraints. A more optimized approach would be needed to handle the upper limits efficiently.
