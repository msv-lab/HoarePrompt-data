Let's analyze the provided program and compare it to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

### Analysis
The program iterates over each test case and calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the provided formula. However, the formula used in the program does not match the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which suggests that it is counting pairs where `b = 1`. However, the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` is not derived from the problem statement.

2. **Loop over `b`**: The loop iterates from `b = 2` to `min(n, m)`. This part seems correct in terms of iterating over all possible values of `b`.

3. **Calculation of `ans`**: The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for each `b`. To determine the correct number of valid pairs for each `b`, we need to ensure that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve iterating over each possible `b` and then finding the valid `a` values that satisfy the condition. Here's a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. For each `b` from `1` to `m`:
   - For each `a` from `1` to `n`:
     - Check if `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`
     - If true, increment the count.

However, the provided program does not follow this approach and instead uses a formula that does not match the problem description.

### Conclusion
Given the mismatch between the provided formula and the problem description, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program uses a formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` which is not derived from the problem statement. A correct implementation would involve checking each pair `(a, b)` to see if it satisfies the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Since the provided program does not do this, it is incorrect.
