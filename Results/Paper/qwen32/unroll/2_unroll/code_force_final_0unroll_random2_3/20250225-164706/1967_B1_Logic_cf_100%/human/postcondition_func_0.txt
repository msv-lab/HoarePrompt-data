The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`, and then computes and prints a specific value `ans` based on these inputs. The value of `ans` is calculated by starting with `n` and adding the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This process is repeated for all test cases.
