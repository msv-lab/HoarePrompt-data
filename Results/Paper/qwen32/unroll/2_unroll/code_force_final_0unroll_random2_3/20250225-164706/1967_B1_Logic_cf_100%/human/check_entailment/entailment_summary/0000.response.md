Reasoning: 

The given program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the implementation provided does not correctly compute this number for all test cases.

The core issue lies in the logic used to compute the number of valid pairs. The program calculates `ans` by initializing it to `n` and then adding the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This logic does not accurately count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied. The provided program does not perform this check directly and instead uses a different formula that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

Given the mismatch between the intended logic and the actual implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
