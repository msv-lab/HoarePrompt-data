Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a line of `n` people. He can bribe people in front of him to swap positions, paying a certain number of coins for each swap. The goal is to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to achieve his goal.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Reading**: Reads `n` (number of people in the queue), `k` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill), and two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The code calculates a prefix sum of `lista_B` and uses it to determine the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.
   - **Logic**:
     - The reversed lists are used to simplify the logic of moving Kirill from the end of the queue to the front.
     - The code iterates through the reversed lists and calculates the cost of moving Kirill to each position, keeping track of the minimum cost.
     - The final result is printed, which is the minimum number of coins required for Kirill to be in one of the first `m` positions.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Correctness
The provided solution seems to have a logical error in its approach. The reversal of the lists and the way the prefix sum is used may not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The problem involves moving Kirill to one of the first `m` positions, but the solution's logic does not correctly account for the cost of moving Kirill to each position while ensuring he ends up in one of the first `m` positions.

Let's consider the example provided:
- **Example Input**:
  ```
  4
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  6 2
  6 9 7 1 8 3
  5 8 8 1 4 1
  7 7
  7 2 9 2 6 5 9
  9 1 10 7 1 4 9
  2 1
  2 3
  1 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  14
  22
  9
  3
  ```

The solution provided does not correctly handle the problem's requirements, and the output does not match the expected results. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
