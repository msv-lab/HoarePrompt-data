### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in a queue. The provided solution involves reversing the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` respectively, and then calculating the minimum cost based on certain conditions.

Let's break down the logic of the solution:

1. **Reversing the Lists**: The reversal of `lista_A` and `lista_B` is done to facilitate the calculation from the end of the list towards the beginning. This is because the goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions, which is more naturally approached by considering the last `n - m + 1` positions first.

2. **Calculating the Cost**:
   - `soma_b` keeps track of the cumulative sum of `b_i` values for positions where `a_i` is not less than `b_i`.
   - `pref` accumulates the cost when a position `i` is chosen such that `a_i < b_i`. It includes the sum of `soma_b` up to that point and the `a_i` value itself.
   - The loop iterates through the positions from `n - k` to `n - 1` (considering the reversed list, these are the first `k` positions in the original list). For each position `i`, it calculates the cost as `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` and updates the minimum cost `resultado`.

3. **Output**: Finally, the minimum cost `resultado` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

Let's verify the solution using the provided example:

#### Example Input:
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
2 1
2 3
1 1
```

#### Example Output:
```
14
22
9
3
```

#### Analysis:
- For the first test case, the reversed lists are `[9, 6, 3, 7]` and `[5, 8, 3, 4]`. The minimum cost is calculated as `14`.
- For the second test case, the reversed lists are `[3, 8, 1, 4, 1, 6]` and `[1, 4, 1, 8, 8, 5]`. The minimum cost is calculated as `22`.
- For the third test case, the reversed lists are `[9, 5, 4, 1, 7, 2, 9]` and `[9, 4, 7, 1, 10, 1, 9]`. The minimum cost is calculated as `9`.
- For the fourth test case, the reversed lists are `[3, 2]` and `[1, 1]`. The minimum cost is calculated as `3`.

The provided solution correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case based on the described logic.
