In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `numero_testes`. The loop will execute based on the value of `numero_testes`. Since the problem states that `numero_testes` is an input integer where `1 <= numero_testes <= 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `numero_testes` is at least 1.

Given that the loop body is omitted, we only need to ensure that `numero_testes` is within the specified range to guarantee that the loop will execute. Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `1 <= numero_testes <= 10^4`, no further adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`numero_testes` is an input integer, where 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4**
