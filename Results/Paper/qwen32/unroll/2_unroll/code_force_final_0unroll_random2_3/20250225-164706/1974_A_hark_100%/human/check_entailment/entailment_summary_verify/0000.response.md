Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Syntax Error**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined. This will indeed lead to a `NameError` at runtime.
2. **Logic for Calculating Screens**:
   - **Handling of 2x2 Icons**: The code correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons (`bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`).
   - **Handling of 1x1 Icons**: The code then adjusts the number of `1x1` icons by subtracting the space occupied by `2x2` icons. However, it incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` instead of `bxsfory * 4`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Subtracting Space Occupied by 2x2 Icons**:
  - Each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells.
  - If `y` is the number of `2x2` icons, the total number of cells occupied by `2x2` icons is `y * 4`.
  - The code incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x`. This is a logical error because it incorrectly assumes each `2x2` icon occupies 15 cells, which is incorrect.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Input**: `x = 13, y = 2`
- **Expected Output**: `2`
- **Actual Output** (Based on the code):
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
  - `x = 13 - 1 * 15 + 2 * 4 = 13 - 15 + 8 = 6`
  - `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(6 / 15) = 1`
  - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory) = print(1 + 1) = 2`
  
  The code actually prints `2` for this test case, which is correct in this particular case, but it is still incorrect in general due to the logic flaw.

### General Case:
- **Input**: `x = 13, y = 3`
- **Expected Output**: `3`
- **Actual Output** (Based on the code):
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
  - `x = 13 - 2 * 15 + 3 * 4 = 13 - 30 + 12 = -5`
  - `bxsfory1 = 0` (since `x <= 0`)
  - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory) = print(0 + 2) = 2`
  
  The code incorrectly prints `2` for this test case, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The code contains both a syntax error (function call before definition) and a logical error in the calculation of the remaining `1x1` icons. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
