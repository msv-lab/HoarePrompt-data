Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D", and `data` is a list of strings resulting from `sys.stdin.read().split()`. `index` is 0.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `index` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
