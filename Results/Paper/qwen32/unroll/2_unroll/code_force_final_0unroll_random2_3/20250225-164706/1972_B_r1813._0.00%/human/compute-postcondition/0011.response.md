Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If it is, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".**
