### Reasoning:
The program reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of the number of coins and a string representing the state of each coin (either facing up 'U' or down 'D'). The program then determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

The logic behind the solution is based on the observation that each time a player removes a facing-up coin, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins changes. Since the game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, the player who starts the game (Alice) will win if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob will win if it is even.

The provided code correctly implements this logic. It reads the input, counts the number of 'U's for each test case, and appends 'YES' to the results list if the count is odd, otherwise 'NO'. Finally, it prints the results.
