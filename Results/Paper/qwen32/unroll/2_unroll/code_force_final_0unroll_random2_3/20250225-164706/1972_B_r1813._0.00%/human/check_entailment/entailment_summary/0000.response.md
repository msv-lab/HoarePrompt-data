Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the solution based on the problem description. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up ("U") coins. If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. The program reads the input, counts the number of "U" coins for each test case, checks if this count is odd, and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
