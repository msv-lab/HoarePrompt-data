The code reads from the standard input and splits the input into a list of strings. Given that the initial state specifies that `t` and `n` are integers and `s` is a string, the input is expected to be structured in a way that can be split into parts. However, without specific input provided, we can only infer the general transformation.

The variable `data` will be a list of strings resulting from the split operation. Since the structure of the input is not specified beyond being split, we can only say that `data` will hold the split parts of the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D", and `data` is a list of strings resulting from `sys.stdin.read().split()`.**
