Given the initial state, we know that `n` is 0, and `h` is the sum of the quotients from some divisions performed in each iteration, with the condition that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. However, the values of `k`, `costs`, and the exact divisions performed are not explicitly provided.

The `print(*costs)` statement will unpack the `costs` list and print each element in the list separated by a space.

Since the exact values of `costs` are not given, we can only describe the output in terms of the `costs` list.

Output: **the elements of the `costs` list separated by spaces**
