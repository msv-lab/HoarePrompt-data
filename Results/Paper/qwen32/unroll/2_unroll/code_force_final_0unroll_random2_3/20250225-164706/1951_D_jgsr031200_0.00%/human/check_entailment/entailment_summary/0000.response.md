Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. The program's current implementation does not correctly address the problem requirements for all possible inputs.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Base Cases Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by printing "YES", followed by `1` for the number of stalls and `1` for the price per jewel. This is because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels if each jewel costs `1` coin.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO". This is because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than jewels.

2. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program's logic for the general case (`n > k`) is flawed. It initializes a list `costs` with two values `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with these prices. It sums up the quotients of `n` divided by each price in `costs` and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to `k`. However, this approach is not guaranteed to work for all values of `n` and `k`.
   - The program does not ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60 and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices. The current implementation might not find a valid configuration of prices that satisfies the conditions.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints "YES" and the prices in the correct format when the sum of the quotients is greater than or equal to `k`. However, it prints "NO" when the sum is less than `k`, which is correct. But the logic to determine the prices and the number of stalls is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob can use a strategy that involves setting prices in a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use binary representation or a greedy strategy to determine the prices and the number of stalls.

Given the current implementation's flaws, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
