In the given initial state, the variables `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and it is specified that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **1**
