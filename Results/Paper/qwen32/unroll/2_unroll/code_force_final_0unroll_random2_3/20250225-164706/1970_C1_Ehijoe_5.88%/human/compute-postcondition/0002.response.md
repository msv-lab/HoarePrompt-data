Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone where 1 <= u_1 <= n, `tree` is an empty deque, `empty` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is set to `True`, but no other variables are affected by the given code snippet. The initial state of `n`, `t`, the tree edges, and the starting node of the stone remains unchanged.
