Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given integer `n`.
- The encoding is done by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet (a=1, ..., z=26).
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to determine the first two letters.
     - If `lex < 28`, it assigns `1` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it assigns `26` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it again assigns `26` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it assigns the remaining value of `lex` to the third position in `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.

3. **Converting to Letters:**
   - For each test case, the program converts the values in `arr` to their corresponding letters by adding `96` (since `chr(97)` is 'a').
   - It concatenates these letters to form the word and prints it.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the smallest possible values for the first two letters.
- The sorting step is unnecessary because the letters should be determined in a way that ensures the smallest possible lexicographical order from the start.
- The program does not handle the edge cases correctly, especially when `lex` is near the minimum or maximum possible values.

### Correct Approach:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters (e.g., 'a' or 'b') and then calculate the third letter based on the remaining sum.
- Ensure that the sum of the three letters equals `lex`.
- The program should ensure that the letters are in the smallest possible lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
