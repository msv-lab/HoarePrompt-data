### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the problem description and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that sums to a given integer `n`.
- Each letter is mapped to its position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` (which is `n` in the problem statement).
   - It then attempts to construct the word by distributing `lex` across three letters.
   
3. **Distributing the Value:**
   - The program uses a loop to distribute the value of `lex` across the first two letters. It checks if `lex` is less than 28, 52, or 78 to decide the value for the first two letters.
   - After distributing the value for the first two letters, it assigns the remaining value to the third letter.
   - The values are then sorted to ensure they are in ascending order.
   - Finally, these values are converted to corresponding letters and printed.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
- **State Analysis:**
  - Before the function call, `t` (number of test cases) is an integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, `n` (encoded value) is an integer between 3 and 78.
  - After processing each test case, `info` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains three integers derived from `lex`.
  - The sorting step ensures that the integers in each sublist are in ascending order.
  - The final step converts these integers to characters and prints them.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Distribution Logic:**
  - The logic for distributing `lex` among the three letters is flawed. It only considers specific thresholds (28, 52, 78) to assign values to the first two letters, which does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.
  - For example, when `lex = 55`, the correct smallest word is `czz` (3 + 26 + 26 = 55). However, the program might not correctly handle this case.
  
- **Sorting Does Not Ensure Lexicographical Order:**
  - Sorting the integers ensures they are in ascending order but does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, `[1, 26, 28]` would be sorted to `[1, 26, 28]`, but the corresponding word `acz` is not the smallest possible word for a given sum.

#### Testing with Example:
- **Example Case: `n = 55`**
  - Correct smallest word: `czz` (3 + 26 + 26 = 55)
  - Program's approach:
    - First two letters are assigned based on thresholds.
    - Remaining value is assigned to the third letter.
    - Values are sorted and converted to characters.
  - Given the flawed distribution logic, the program might not output `czz`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and might not produce the lexicographically smallest word for all values of `n`. The distribution logic is flawed, and sorting the values does not ensure the correct lexicographical order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**.
