`cases` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` and the condition for `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` is an input integer.**
