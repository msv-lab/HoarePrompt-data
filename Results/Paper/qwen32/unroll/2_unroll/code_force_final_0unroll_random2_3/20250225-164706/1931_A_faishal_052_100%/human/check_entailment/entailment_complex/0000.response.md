Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could have been encoded to a given integer, where each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the three letters that sum up to the given integer. The strategy is to minimize the first letter, then the second, and finally the third to ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.

However, there is a flaw in the logic of the program. The program uses a conditional structure to determine the values of the first two letters, but this logic does not guarantee that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest possible. Specifically, the conditions:
- `if lex < 28: arr.append(1); lex = lex - 1`
- `elif lex < 52: arr.append(26); lex = lex - 26`
- `elif lex <= 78: arr.append(26); lex = lex - 26`

do not correctly handle the distribution of the sum across the three letters to ensure the smallest possible lexicographical order. For example, when `lex` is 24, the program might incorrectly assign the first two letters as 'a' and 'z' (1 + 26 = 27), and the third letter as 'x' (24 - 27 + 26 = 23), resulting in 'azx', which is not the smallest lexicographical order ('aav' is correct).

To fix this, the program should directly calculate the values for the three letters in a way that minimizes the first letter first, then the second, and finally the third. This can be done by using a greedy approach, starting with the smallest possible values for the first two letters and adjusting the third letter accordingly.

Correctness: **False**
