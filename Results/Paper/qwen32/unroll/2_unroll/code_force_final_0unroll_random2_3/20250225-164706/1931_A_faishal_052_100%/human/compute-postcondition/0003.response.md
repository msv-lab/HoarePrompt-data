To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the code and understand how each iteration affects the `info` list.

We start with the following initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `cases` is an input integer.
- `info` is an empty list.

The loop runs `cases` times, and in each iteration:
1. An empty list `arr` is created.
2. An integer `lex` is read from the input.
3. The code then enters a nested loop that runs twice:
   - If `lex` is less than 28, `1` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by `1`.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, `26` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by `26`.
   - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, `26` is appended to `arr`, and `lex` is decremented by `26`.
4. After the nested loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.
5. `arr` is sorted, and then appended to the `info` list.

Let's consider the possible scenarios for `lex`:
- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` will end up as `[1, lex-1, lex]` after sorting.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51, `arr` will end up as `[1, 26, lex-26]` after sorting.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78, `arr` will end up as `[26, 26, lex-52]` after sorting.

The final `info` list will contain `cases` number of sorted lists, each constructed as described above based on the value of `lex` provided in each iteration.

Given the above analysis, the output state can be described as follows:
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- `cases` remains unchanged.
- `info` is a list of `cases` number of sorted lists, each containing 3 integers derived from the values of `lex` as described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `cases` is an input integer, `info` is a list of `cases` number of sorted lists, each containing 3 integers derived from the values of `lex` as described.**
