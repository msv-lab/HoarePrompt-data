To determine the output state, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over `cases` number of times, where each iteration processes a list of 3 integers from `info`. For each integer in the list, it converts the integer to a character by adding 96 to it (which effectively maps 1 to 'a', 2 to 'b', and so on up to 26 for 'z'). It concatenates these characters into a string and prints the string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `cases` is the number of test cases.
- `info` is a list of `cases` number of lists, each containing 3 integers.

The loop processes each list in `info` and prints a string of 3 characters derived from the integers in the list.

Since the loop only prints the results and does not modify `t`, `n`, `cases`, or `info`, the output state in terms of these variables remains the same as the initial state. However, the output of the loop (which is printed) will be a series of strings, each corresponding to a list in `info`.

Output State: **The output state is the same as the initial state for `t`, `n`, `cases`, and `info`. Additionally, the loop will print `cases` number of strings, each consisting of 3 characters derived from the integers in the corresponding list in `info`.**
