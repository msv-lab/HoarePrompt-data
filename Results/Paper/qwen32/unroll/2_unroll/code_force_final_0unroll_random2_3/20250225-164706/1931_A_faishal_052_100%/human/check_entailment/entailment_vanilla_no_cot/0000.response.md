Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible encoded values. Specifically, the logic for breaking down the encoded sum into three letters is flawed and does not always result in the smallest possible letters. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. The program attempts to break down the sum into three parts, but the logic for distributing the sum across the three letters is incorrect. It does not ensure that the letters are as small as possible while still summing up to the given encoded value.
2. The program checks for specific ranges (less than 28, less than 52, and less than or equal to 78) to assign values to the first two letters, which is not the correct approach for finding the smallest possible letters.
3. The program sorts the resulting list of numbers before converting them to letters, but this does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters 'aaa'
        a = b = c = 1
        # Distribute the remaining sum (n - 3) among a, b, and c
        remaining = n - 3
        # First, try to increase 'c' as much as possible
        c += min(remaining, 25)
        remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
        # Then, try to increase 'b' as much as possible
        b += min(remaining, 25)
        remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
        # The remaining value goes to 'a'
        a += remaining
        # Convert the values to letters and print the result
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the letters are as small as possible while still summing up to the given encoded value, thus producing the lexicographically smallest word.
