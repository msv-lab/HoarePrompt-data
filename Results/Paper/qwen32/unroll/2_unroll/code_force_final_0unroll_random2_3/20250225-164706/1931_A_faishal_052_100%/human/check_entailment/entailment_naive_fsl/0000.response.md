Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The program should find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could have been encoded to a given integer `n`.
- The integer `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
- It then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word by distributing the value of `n` across three letters.
- The logic for constructing the word seems flawed:
  - It only considers two cases for the first two letters and then assigns the remaining value to the third letter.
  - It does not ensure that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest in all cases.
  - The sorting step does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest order.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not correctly distribute the value of `n` to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
- The sorting step after appending the values does not guarantee the correct order.

### Example to Test:
Let's consider the case where `n = 55`:
- The correct lexicographically smallest word is `czz` because `3 + 26 + 26 = 55`.
- The program might not correctly handle this case because it does not distribute the values in a way that ensures the smallest possible letters first.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and might not produce the lexicographically smallest word for all values of `n`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly distribute the value of `n` to ensure the lexicographically smallest word in all cases. For example, with `n = 55`, the program might not output `czz` as expected.
