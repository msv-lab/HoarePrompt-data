Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
We need to determine whether we can sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where an operation consists of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping these two parts.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Checking for Possible Swaps:**
   - If the array is not already sorted, the program iterates over possible split points `i` (from 1 to n-1).
   - For each split point `i`, it checks two conditions:
     1. `all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This checks if the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix `new` (i.e., `a[i:]`).
     2. `all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This checks if the suffix `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program
- The program does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be sorted by a single swap. 
- Specifically, the program only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by a single swap.
- The program should check if there exists a point `i` such that the prefix `a[:i]` is in non-decreasing order, the suffix `a[i:]` is in non-decreasing order, and the last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
