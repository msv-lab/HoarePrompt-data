Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider all possible ways the array can be split and swapped to determine if it can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The main issues are:
1. The program only checks if the array can be split at the first point where the order is violated and then checks if the resulting array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix. It does not consider all possible split points.
2. The program does not correctly handle cases where the array can be split into multiple parts and rearranged to form a sorted array.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
The array can be split into `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is not sorted. However, the array can be split into `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4]`, and then swapped to `[4, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not sorted. But the array can be split into `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4]`, and then swapped to `[3, 1, 4, 2]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4]`, then swap to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4]`, then swap to `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4]`, then swap to `[4, 2, 3, 1]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4]`, then swap to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4]`, then swap to `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = []` and `y = [2, 3, 1, 4]`, then swap to `[2, 3, 1, 4]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4]`, then swap to `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4]`, then swap to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4]`, then swap to `[4, 2, 3, 1]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y = []`, then swap to `[2, 3, 1, 4]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4]`, then swap to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4]`, then swap to `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = []` and `y = [2, 3, 1, 4]`, then swap to `[2, 3, 1, 4]` which is still not sorted. The correct split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4]`, then swap to `[4, 1, 2, 3]` which is sorted.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
No
```

The program fails to identify that the array can be sorted by splitting it into `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4]`, then swapping to `[4, 1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
