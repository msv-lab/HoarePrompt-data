The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`, which represents the number of test cases. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables `n` and the list `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted here.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
