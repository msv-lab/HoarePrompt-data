Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of a test case. Each line contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the array `a` can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is also non-decreasing, with the first element of the array being greater than or equal to all elements in the second part.**
