The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `idx_v`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, or `idx`, which remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, with new values provided by the input; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`; `idx` is `0`; `idx_v` is `1`.**
