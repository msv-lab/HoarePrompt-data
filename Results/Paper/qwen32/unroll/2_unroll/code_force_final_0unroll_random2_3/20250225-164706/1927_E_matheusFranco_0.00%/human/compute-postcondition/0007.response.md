The code snippet creates a string `result` by joining the elements of the list `permutation` with a space. The values of `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged. The output state is described as follows:

Output State: **`permutation` is [1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6], `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 11, `result` is '1 4 7 9 2 5 8 10 3 6'**.
