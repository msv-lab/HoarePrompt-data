Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all edge cases and scenarios correctly as per the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Condition Handling for Alice and Bob's Positions**:
   - The code uses `if xa > xb: print('Draw')` to determine the outcome. This is incorrect because it only considers the row positions of Alice and Bob. It does not consider the column positions or the potential moves of both players.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. It calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` and then checks conditions based on this value. However, this does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players and the potential capture scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases and Test Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where Alice or Bob is already in a position to win on their first move. For example, if Alice is directly below Bob and can move diagonally to capture him, the code might not correctly identify Alice as the winner.
   - The code does not handle cases where the board dimensions are small, and the players can force a draw or win in fewer moves.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (3, 3).
- Alice can move to (2, 2) and capture Bob on her first move.
- The code would incorrectly output "Draw" because it does not correctly simulate Alice's optimal move.

**Another Test Case**:
```
1
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (2, 2).
- Alice can move to (2, 2) and capture Bob on her first move.
- The code would incorrectly output "Draw" because it does not correctly simulate Alice's optimal move.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
