You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each involving a grid of dimensions `h` by `w` and two distinct points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` on the grid. For each test case, it prints either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the relative positions of the points and the grid dimensions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, on a checkered board. Alice starts first and can move her chip down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob can move his chip up, up-right, or up-left. The game ends when a player lands on a cell occupied by the other player, or when a player cannot make a move (Alice when she is at the last row, Bob when he is at the first row), resulting in a draw.

### Key Points:
1. **Alice's Movement**: Down, Down-Right, Down-Left.
2. **Bob's Movement**: Up, Up-Right, Up-Left.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they land on a cell occupied by the other player.
4. **Draw Condition**: When a player cannot make a move.

### Strategy:
- If Alice is initially below Bob (`xa > xb`), Alice cannot move up to reach Bob, and Bob cannot move down to reach Alice, so the game is a draw.
- If Alice is initially above Bob (`xa < xb`), Alice can potentially reach Bob, and Bob can potentially reach Alice. The strategy involves calculating the maximum distance Alice can cover vertically and the range of columns she can reach horizontally within this vertical distance. If Alice can reach Bob's column within this range, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows a similar logic:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice and Bob.
2. **Decision Making**:
   - If Alice is initially below Bob (`xa > xb`), it prints "Draw".
   - If Alice is initially above Bob (`xa < xb`), it calculates the maximum vertical distance Alice can cover (`x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`).
     - If the vertical distance is odd, it calculates the range of columns Alice can reach horizontally within this vertical distance and checks if she can reach Bob's column.
     - If the vertical distance is even, it calculates the range of columns Alice can reach horizontally within this vertical distance and checks if Bob can reach Alice's column.

### Correctness Check:
The program seems to correctly identify the draw condition when Alice is initially below Bob. However, the logic for determining the winner when Alice is above Bob is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for determining if Alice or Bob can reach each other are not correctly implemented.

### Flaws in the Program:
1. **Odd Vertical Distance**:
   - The program calculates `l` and `r` as the range of columns Alice can reach horizontally within the vertical distance. However, the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are not sufficient to determine if Alice can reach Bob. The correct condition should be if Bob's column is within the range `[l, r]` and Alice can reach Bob's row within the given number of moves.
2. **Even Vertical Distance**:
   - Similarly, the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` are not sufficient to determine if Bob can reach Alice. The correct condition should be if Alice's column is within the range `[l, r]` and Bob can reach Alice's row within the given number of moves.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine the winner in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
