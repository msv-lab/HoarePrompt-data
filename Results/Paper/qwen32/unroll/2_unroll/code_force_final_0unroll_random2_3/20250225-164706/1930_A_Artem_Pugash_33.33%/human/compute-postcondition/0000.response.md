`numCases` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value of the number of test cases provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`) remain unchanged as the code snippet does not affect them directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and there are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `numCases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
