### Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program begins by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and then reads the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. This ensures that the smallest numbers come first, which is crucial for maximizing the score because the score is incremented by the minimum of the two chosen numbers.

3. **Pairing and Summing**:
   - The program iteratively pairs the smallest numbers by popping the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest due to the sorting step) and adds the minimum of these two numbers to the score.
   - This process continues until all numbers have been paired and removed from the list.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all pairs for a particular test case, the program prints the total score for that test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, numbers = `[2, 3]`
   - Sorted numbers: `[2, 3]`
   - Pair: `(2, 3)`, minimum is `2`
   - Score: `2`
   - Output: `2` (matches expected output)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 2`, numbers = `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
   - Sorted numbers: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
   - Pair 1: `(1, 1)`, minimum is `1`
   - Pair 2: `(1, 2)`, minimum is `1`
   - Total score: `1 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (matches expected output)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, numbers = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Sorted numbers: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Pair 1: `(1, 1)`, minimum is `1`
   - Pair 2: `(1, 1)`, minimum is `1`
   - Pair 3: `(1, 1)`, minimum is `1`
   - Total score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (matches expected output)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. It handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
