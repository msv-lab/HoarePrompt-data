### Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available numbers to pair. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates `t` times. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`n`) and the list of `2n` integers. This matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we pair the numbers, we are always pairing the smallest available numbers, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the minimums.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list (the smallest two numbers), calculates the minimum of the pair, adds this minimum to the score (`suma`), and continues until all numbers are paired and removed from the list.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the final score, which is the sum of the minimums of the pairs.

The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior, which aligns with the optimal strategy to solve the problem.

### Correctness: **True**
