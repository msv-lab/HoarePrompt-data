Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score by sorting the numbers in ascending order and then pairing them such that the smallest numbers are paired together, thus maximizing the sum of the minimums. The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of integers and the integers themselves, sorts them, and then calculates the score by summing up the minimum of each pair. The result is printed for each test case as required.
