The given Python code attempts to calculate the square root of `q` using `math.sqrt(q)`. However, `q` is a list of tuples, and the `math.sqrt` function expects a single number, not a list or a tuple. This will result in a `TypeError` because `math.sqrt` cannot operate on a list directly.

Given the initial state and the code provided, the code execution will fail due to the type mismatch. Therefore, the variable `w` will not be assigned a value, and the list `M` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list; a TypeError is raised because `math.sqrt` cannot operate on a list.**
