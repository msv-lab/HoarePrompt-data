You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
        x = n - 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1

    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It constructs a new binary string `s` by finding the first position where the second string has a '1' and the first string has a '0', and then combines parts of the two strings. It also calculates an integer `t` based on the constructed string `s` and the first string. The function prints the constructed string `s` and the integer `t`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1, 1) of a 2xN grid and moving right or downwards, and also determine the number of paths that yield this smallest string.
2. **Constraints**: The grasshopper can only move right or downwards, and we need to consider all possible paths from the start to the bottom-right cell (2, N).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the length of the grid minus one), and two binary strings representing the two rows of the grid.

2. **Logic to Find the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `s` to store the smallest string and a variable `x` to store the index where the path switches from the first row to the second row.
   - It iterates through the columns of the grid (except the last one). If it finds a point where the element in the second row is '0' and the element in the first row is '1', it switches to the second row at that point and breaks the loop.
   - If no such point is found, it means the entire path can stay in the first row except for the last step, where it must move to the second row.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, assuming there is at least one path.
   - It then iterates through the columns up to the switching point `x`. If the prefix of the first row matches the prefix of the smallest string `s` up to that point, it updates `t` to be the number of ways to reach that point in the first row (which is `x - i + 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the smallest string `s` and the number of paths `t`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Logic Flaws**:
  - The program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple ways to form the smallest string. For example, if there are multiple points where the second row has a '0' and the first row has a '1', the program only considers the first such point.
  - The counting of paths is incorrect. The number of paths to a point `(i, j)` in the grid should be calculated using dynamic programming or combinatorial methods, not simply by checking the prefix match.
  - The program does not handle the case where the entire path can stay in the first row if all elements are '0' or if the second row starts with '1' and the first row starts with '0'.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic and the counting of paths, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
