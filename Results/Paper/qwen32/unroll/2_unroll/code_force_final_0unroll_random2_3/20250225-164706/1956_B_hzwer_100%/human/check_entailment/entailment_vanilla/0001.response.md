Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a card game where two players, you and Nene, each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck. The goal is to maximize your score by strategically placing cards on the table. You earn a point each time you place a card that already has a matching card on the table.

### Key Points:
1. **Turn Order**: You and Nene take turns alternately, with you starting.
2. **Nene's Strategy**: Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
3. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

### Strategy:
- **Your Optimal Play**: To maximize your score, you should aim to place cards that have already been placed on the table by Nene. 
- **Nene's Optimal Play**: Nene will also aim to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means she will try to place cards that do not immediately give you a point, unless it's unavoidable.

### Key Insight:
- If a card number appears twice in your hand, you can score one point by placing the second card after Nene has placed the first.
- If a card number appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point with that card.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting how many card numbers appear more than once in your hand. This is because each pair of the same card number allows you to score one point.

Let's break down the program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `n` integers representing the cards in your hand.
2. **Counting Cards**: It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n+1` to zero. Then, it iterates through your cards and increments the count for each card number.
3. **Calculating Points**: For each card number, if it appears more than once (`cnt[x] > 1`), it adds `cnt[x] - 1` to the answer. This is because each pair of the same card number allows you to score one point.
4. **Output**: It prints the calculated score for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the number of pairs of each card number in your hand. This aligns with the optimal strategy for the game, where you aim to place the second card of each pair after Nene has placed the first.

**Correctness: True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem based on the given constraints and requirements.
