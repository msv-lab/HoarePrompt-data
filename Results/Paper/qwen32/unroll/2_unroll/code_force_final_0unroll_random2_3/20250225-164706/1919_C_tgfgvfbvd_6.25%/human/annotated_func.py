#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: the series of printed values of `c` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of elements in the list that satisfy specific conditions related to being greater or smaller than the two most recently identified significant elements.
