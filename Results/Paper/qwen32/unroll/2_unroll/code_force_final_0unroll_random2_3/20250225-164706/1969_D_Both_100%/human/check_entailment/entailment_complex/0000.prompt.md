Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(read_input())
    #The program returns an integer that is the result of converting the input read by `read_input()` to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and returns that integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`.
def func_2():
    return map(int, read_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers converted from the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes no input parameters and returns a map object containing integers derived from splitting a predefined input string by spaces.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the price of an item for Alice and Bob respectively. secondary_heap is a list of tuples with the same structure as primary_items, representing items that have been placed in a secondary heap (likely for processing).

    #The program returns the total, which is the sum of the first elements of each tuple in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the sums of the two integers in each tuple of `primary_items` where the sum of the two integers is non-negative.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total cost, which includes the sum of the first elements of each tuple in `secondary_heap` and the sum of the sums of the two integers in each tuple of `primary_items` where the sum of the two integers is non-negative.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases to determine the maximum profit that can be achieved. For each test case, it evaluates a list of items, each associated with a price and a bonus, to optimize the profit under the constraint of selecting up to `k` items. It calculates the maximum possible profit by strategically choosing items and adjusting the profit based on their prices and bonuses. The final output for each test case is the maximum profit found.
