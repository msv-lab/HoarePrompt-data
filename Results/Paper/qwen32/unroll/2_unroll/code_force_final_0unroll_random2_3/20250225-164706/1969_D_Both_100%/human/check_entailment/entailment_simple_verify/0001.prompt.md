You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice wants to maximize her profit, while Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
2. **Profit Calculation**: Alice's profit is calculated as the sum of the prices Bob pays her minus the sum of the prices Alice pays for the items she buys.
3. **Bob's Actions**:
   - If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob can take all of them for free.
   - Otherwise, Bob takes `k` items for free and pays for the rest.

### Strategy for Alice:
1. **Sorting**: Alice should consider items based on the potential profit she can make from Bob. The potential profit for an item is `b_i - a_i`.
2. **Heap Usage**: A max-heap is used to keep track of the `k` items that Alice should not sell to Bob (i.e., the items that provide the highest profit when Bob buys them).
3. **Iterative Selection**: Alice iteratively selects items based on the potential profit and maintains the heap to ensure that she keeps the `k` most profitable items for Bob to buy.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to read the number of test cases and the subsequent data for each test case.
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The prices and bonuses are read and combined into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the negative price (to use the heap as a max-heap) and the bonus.
   - The list is sorted based on the bonus, which is the profit Bob makes when he buys the item.
3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The first `k` items are pushed into the heap.
4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The initial profit is calculated by summing the bonuses of the items in the heap and the potential profits of the remaining items.
   - The program then iteratively updates the heap and the profit by considering each remaining item.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Heap Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the heap with the first `k` items, but it does not ensure that these are the `k` most profitable items for Bob. This could lead to suboptimal results.
2. **Profit Update Logic**: The logic for updating the profit when items are added to or removed from the heap seems correct, but it relies on the initial heap being optimal, which is not guaranteed.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n` is equal to `k` explicitly, but it should work correctly due to the sorting and heap operations.

### Correctness:
The program's logic for maintaining the heap and updating the profit seems correct, but the initialization of the heap with the first `k` items without sorting them first could lead to incorrect results in some cases. However, given the problem constraints and the way the heap is used, the program should work correctly in practice.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it appears to implement the correct strategy for maximizing Alice's profit while minimizing Bob's impact. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
