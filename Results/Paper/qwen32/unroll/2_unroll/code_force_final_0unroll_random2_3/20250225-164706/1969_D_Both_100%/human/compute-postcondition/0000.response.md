To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, since the function `func_1()` is not provided, we can only assume that it returns some value, which is assigned to `test_cases`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the function `func_1()`.

Given the lack of details about `func_1()`, we can only update the state based on the assignment of `test_cases`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `prices` is a list of n integers, `neg_prices` is a list of n integers, `bonuses` is a list of n integers, `max_profit` is an integer initialized to 0, `current_profit` is an integer initialized to 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`**.

In natural language: The variables `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` remain unchanged. The variable `test_cases` is now assigned the return value of the function `func_1()`.
