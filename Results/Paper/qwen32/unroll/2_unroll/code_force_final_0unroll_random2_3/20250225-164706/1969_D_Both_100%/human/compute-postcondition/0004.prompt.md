You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: heap is an empty list that will be used as a min-heap, remaining_items is an empty list (its purpose is not clear from the given function), n is a positive integer representing the number of items, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of n integers representing the prices for Alice, neg_prices is a list of n integers representing the negative prices for Alice, bonuses is a list of n integers representing the bonuses for Bob, max_profit is an integer initialized to 0, current_profit is an integer initialized to 0, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus for each item, and combined is sorted based on the bonus values.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        
        max_profit = 0
        
        current_profit = 0
        
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: Output State: `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `k` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `neg_prices` is the list of negated prices from the last iteration, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `max_profit` is the maximum profit found across all test cases, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is an empty list, `test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_4` accepts no parameters directly but utilizes several predefined variables including `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`. It processes these variables to determine and return the maximum possible profit (`max_profit`) that can be achieved under the given constraints. The function handles the logic of selecting items based on their bonuses and prices to optimize the profit for both Alice and Bob.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
