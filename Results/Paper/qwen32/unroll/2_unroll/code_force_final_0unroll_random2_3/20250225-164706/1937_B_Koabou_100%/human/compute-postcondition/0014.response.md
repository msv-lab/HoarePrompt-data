Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`, representing a grid. It processes up to 10^4 such test cases, with the total length of all binary strings combined not exceeding 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided grid.**
