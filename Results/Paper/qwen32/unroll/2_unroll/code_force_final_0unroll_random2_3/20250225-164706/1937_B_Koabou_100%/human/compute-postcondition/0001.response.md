Output State: **`a` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the grid. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer, while `a` remains an empty list. The other conditions regarding the test cases and the grid remain unchanged.
