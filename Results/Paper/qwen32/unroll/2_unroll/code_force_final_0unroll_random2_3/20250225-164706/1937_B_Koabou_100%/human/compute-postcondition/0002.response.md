The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the range provided, which is `2` in this case. The loop will execute exactly twice regardless of the values of `a`, `n`, or the binary strings provided.

Since the loop will execute exactly twice based on the range, there is no need to adjust the state of `a`, `n`, or the binary strings for the loop to execute. The state of the underscore `_` does not need to be adjusted either because it is not used within the loop body.

Thus, the state before the loop starts does not need any modification for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5)**
