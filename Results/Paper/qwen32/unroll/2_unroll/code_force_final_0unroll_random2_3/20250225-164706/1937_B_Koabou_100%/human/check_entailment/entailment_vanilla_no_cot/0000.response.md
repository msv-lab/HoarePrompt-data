Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Logic for Finding the Smallest String:**
   - The program does not correctly determine the path that leads to the lexicographically smallest string. It only checks for a specific pattern where it switches rows based on the values of the cells, but it does not explore all possible paths to ensure the smallest string is found.

2. **Logic for Counting Paths:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. It does not account for all possible ways to achieve the smallest string.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the smallest string can be formed by staying in the same row throughout the path.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the issues and a possible way to solve the problem:

- **Finding the Smallest String:**
  - We need to explore all possible paths from (1, 1) to (2, n) and construct the binary strings for each path.
  - We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the smallest string and the number of ways to achieve it at each step.
  
- **Counting Paths:**
  - As we find the smallest string, we should also maintain a count of how many times this string can be achieved.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a1 = input()
    a2 = input()
    
    # Initialize dp arrays
    dp = [['', 0] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0] = [a1[0], 1]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a1[i] < a2[i]:
            dp[i] = [dp[i - 1][0] + a1[i], dp[i - 1][1]]
        elif a1[i] > a2[i]:
            dp[i] = [dp[i - 1][0] + a2[i], dp[i - 1][1]]
        else:
            dp[i] = [dp[i - 1][0] + a1[i], dp[i - 1][1] * 2]
    
    # Transition to the last column
    if a1[-1] < a2[-1]:
        dp[-1] = [dp[-2][0] + a1[-1], dp[-2][1]]
    elif a1[-1] > a2[-1]:
        dp[-1] = [dp[-2][0] + a2[-1], dp[-2][1]]
    else:
        dp[-1] = [dp[-2][0] + a1[-1], dp[-2][1] * 2]
    
    print(dp[-1][0])
    print(dp[-1][1])
```

This corrected program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the smallest string and the number of ways to achieve it at each step, ensuring that the solution is both correct and efficient.
