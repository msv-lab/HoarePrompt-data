Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it processes the binary strings and prints a modified binary string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified binary string `s` is derived based on specific conditions involving transitions between '0' and '1' in the input strings, and `t` is determined by the length of a matching substring.**
