The code provided is `loop = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the constraints) are not affected by this line of code.

Since `loop` is assigned the value of the input, the output state will include this new value for `loop`. The other variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; no two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct); `loop` is an input integer.**
