You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).
   - It then reads each constraint and categorizes them based on their type (`a`):
     - If `a` is 1, the constraint is of type "k must be greater than or equal to x" and `x` is added to the `big` list.
     - If `a` is 2, the constraint is of type "k must be less than or equal to x" and `x` is added to the `less` list.
     - If `a` is 3, the constraint is of type "k must be not equal to x" and `x` is added to the `no` list.

2. **Calculating the Range**:
   - The program calculates the potential range of valid `k` values using `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
   - This formula calculates the number of integers from the smallest upper bound to the largest lower bound, inclusive.
   - If the calculated number of integers (`num`) is less than 1, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints of type 1 and 2, and the program outputs 0 for that test case.

3. **Excluding Values**:
   - If there is a valid range (`num >= 1`), the program then iterates over the `no` list.
   - For each value `i` in `no`, it checks if `i` falls within the valid range (`i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`).
   - If `i` is within the range, it decrements `num` by 1, effectively excluding that value from the valid range.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the adjusted number of valid `k` values (`num`) for each test case.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program by checking if it aligns with the problem requirements:

- **Handling Constraints**:
  - The program correctly separates and processes constraints of each type.
  - It calculates the range of valid `k` values based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
  - It correctly excludes values specified in constraints of type 3 that fall within the valid range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where no valid `k` exists by checking if the calculated range is less than 1.
  - It also correctly handles cases where multiple constraints of type 3 might exclude all possible values within the range.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all types of constraints and correctly calculates the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
