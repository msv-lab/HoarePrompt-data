### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game given the rules, we need to analyze the conditions under which Alice or Bob can force a win.

1. **Initial Conditions and Moves:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - After optionally swapping, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., both wallets have 0 coins).

2. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The key insight is that the game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the difference (`abs(a - b)`) is even, Bob can always force a win.
     - This is because Bob can mirror Alice's moves. If Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. Since the difference is even, Bob can always ensure that Alice is the one left with no coins.
   - If the difference (`abs(a - b)`) is odd, Alice can always force a win.
     - Alice can adjust her moves to ensure that Bob is the one left with no coins, given the odd difference.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The provided program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between the coins is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

The program correctly implements the strategy analysis described above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the optimal strategy derived.

Correctness: **True**
