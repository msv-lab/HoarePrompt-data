Let's analyze the provided program for the described problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob have `a` and `b` coins respectively.
- They take turns, starting with Alice.
- In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or not, then must remove one coin from the current wallet.
- The player who can't make a move loses.
- Both play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- If `a == b`, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by mirroring the second player's moves until the game reaches a state where both wallets have 1 coin. At that point, Bob will be forced to take the last coin, and Alice will win.
- If `a != b`, the player with more coins can force a win by always making the difference between the number of coins in their wallets odd after their turn. This ensures that the other player is always left with an even difference, eventually leading to a losing position.

### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program determines the winner based on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Correctness Verification:
- **Case 1: `a == b`**
  - The difference is 0, which is even. According to the program, Bob wins. However, as per the observations, Alice should win by mirroring Bob's moves until the end.
  - This is a contradiction.

- **Case 2: `a != b`**
  - If the difference is odd, Alice wins, which aligns with the observations.
  - If the difference is even, Bob wins, which contradicts the observations (Bob should lose if the difference is even because Alice can always force a win).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal strategies described in the problem statement.

### Example of Incorrectness:
For `a = 1` and `b = 1`:
- The program outputs "Bob".
- The correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can mirror Bob's moves until the end, ensuring her win.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
