### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins Alice and Bob have, assuming both play optimally. The critical insight is that the game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob start with.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Game Dynamics**: Each player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses.
2. **Optimal Play**: Both players will play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have is even, Bob wins.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, Alice wins.

This strategy works because:
- If the difference is even, Alice can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that Bob is the one who ends up with no coins.
- If the difference is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by making the first move in such a way that the difference becomes even after her move.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and printing the appropriate winner based on that.

### Correctness:
Given the provided program and the execution summary, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
