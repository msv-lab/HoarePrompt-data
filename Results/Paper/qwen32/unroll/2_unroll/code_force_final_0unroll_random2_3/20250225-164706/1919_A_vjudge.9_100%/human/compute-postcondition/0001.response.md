The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts; it will be initialized by the `range` function.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The value of `t` is read from the input and represents the number of test cases.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts**
Since `t` is read from the input, we need to ensure that the input provided has `t` as a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted as it is controlled by the loop.

Final State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**
