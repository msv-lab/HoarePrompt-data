test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. Specifically, for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is 0. The list of x distinct integers represents the vertices Bessie has chosen and contains values from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
