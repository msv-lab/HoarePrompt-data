The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a list of integers based on the value of `k` and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list is constructed such that it includes specific values derived from `k` and powers of 2, excluding the power of 2 that is closest to `k`.
