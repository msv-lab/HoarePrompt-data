In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop variable `tc` will take values from `0` to `t-1`. To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least `1` because if `t` is `0`, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.

The initial state provided already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least `1`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The loop variable `tc` is automatically initialized to `0` at the start of the loop, and it will increment by `1` with each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0**
