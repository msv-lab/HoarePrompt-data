The `details.sort()` line sorts the list `details` in ascending order based on the tuples it contains. The tuples are of the form `(balance, -i, char)`, where `balance` is the net count of `'('` minus the count of `')'` in the string `s`, `-i` is the negative index of the character in `s`, and `char` is the character itself.

After sorting, the list `details` will be ordered first by `balance`, then by `-i` (which means in descending order of `i` for tuples with the same `balance`), and finally by `char` for tuples with the same `balance` and `i`.

The `balance` variable itself is not directly affected by the sorting of `details`. The `details` list is the variable that undergoes a change.

Output State: **`balance` is the net count of `'('` minus the count of `')'` in the string `s`, and `details` is a sorted list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`, sorted by `balance` ascending, `-i` descending, and `char` ascending.**
