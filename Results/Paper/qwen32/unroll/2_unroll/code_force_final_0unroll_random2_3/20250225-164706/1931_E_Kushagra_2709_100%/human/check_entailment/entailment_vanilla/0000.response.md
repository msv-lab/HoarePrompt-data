Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, playing optimally. The game ends when there is only one number left in the list. The rules are:

1. **Anna's Turn**: She can choose any number in the list and reverse its digits, removing any leading zeros.
2. **Sasha's Turn**: He can choose any two distinct numbers, concatenate them in any order, and replace them with the concatenated number.

The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, meaning there is only one number left in the list. If this number is not less than \( 10^m \), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses two functions:

1. **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**: This is the main function that determines the winner based on the number of digits and the count of trailing zeros in each number.
2. **`zerocnts(num)`**: This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1`:

- **`tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`**: This line calculates the total number of digits in all numbers in the list.
- **`cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`**: This line calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts these counts in descending order.
- **`for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`**: This loop iterates through the sorted trailing zero counts, subtracting the counts at even indices from `tot`. This step is crucial because it simulates the optimal moves of Sasha and Anna.
- **`return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`**: Finally, it checks if the remaining total number of digits (`tot`) is greater than or equal to \( m + 1 \). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Trailing Zeros**: The strategy hinges on the number of trailing zeros because reversing a number with trailing zeros reduces its length. Sasha can concatenate numbers to increase the length of the remaining number, while Anna can remove trailing zeros to decrease the length.
2. **Optimal Play**: The solution assumes both players play optimally. Anna's optimal move is to remove as many trailing zeros as possible, while Sasha's optimal move is to concatenate numbers to maximize the length of the remaining number.
3. **Correctness of the Logic**: The logic correctly simulates the effect of Anna's and Sasha's moves on the total number of digits. By sorting the trailing zeros in descending order and subtracting the counts at even indices, the solution effectively simulates Sasha's and Anna's turns.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and optimal play by both players. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
