The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `len(num) - 1`, `-1`, and `-1`. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value, which depends on the length of `num`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `len(num) - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`. Since `num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, the length of `num` will be at least 1. Therefore, `len(num) - 1` will be at least 0, and the loop will execute.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. The initial state provided is sufficient.

State: **`num` is a string representation of the original integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9; `tot` is 0**
