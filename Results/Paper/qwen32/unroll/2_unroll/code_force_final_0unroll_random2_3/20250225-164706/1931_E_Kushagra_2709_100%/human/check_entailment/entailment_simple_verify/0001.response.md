To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotations.

### Problem Recap
- **Anna's Turn**: Choose an element and reverse its digits, removing leading zeros.
- **Sasha's Turn**: Choose two elements, concatenate them in any order, and replace them with the concatenated number.
- **Winning Condition**: After Anna's turn, if the remaining number is not less than \(10^m\), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Program Analysis
The program uses two functions:
1. **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**: Determines the winner based on the number of digits and trailing zeros.
2. **`zerocnts(num)`**: Counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `zerocnts(num)`
- **Purpose**: Count the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
- **Implementation**: Iterates from the end of the string representation of `num` and counts zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.
- **Annotation**: Correctly counts trailing zeros.

#### Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`
- **Purpose**: Determine the winner.
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Calculate Total Digits (`tot`)**: Sum of the number of digits in all numbers in `nums`.
  2. **Calculate Trailing Zeros (`cntvals`)**: For each number in `nums`, calculate the number of trailing zeros and sort these counts in descending order.
  3. **Simulate Moves**:
     - Iterate through `cntvals` with a step of 2, subtracting the counts at even indices from `tot`. This simulates Anna's and Sasha's optimal moves.
     - **Anna's Move**: Removes trailing zeros (reduces length).
     - **Sasha's Move**: Concatenates numbers (increases length).
  4. **Determine Winner**: If `tot` is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Validation of Logic
- **Trailing Zeros**: The strategy correctly considers the impact of Anna's moves (removing trailing zeros) and Sasha's moves (concatenating numbers).
- **Optimal Play**: The logic assumes both players play optimally, which aligns with the problem's requirement.
- **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, matching the intended logic.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and optimal play by both players. The annotations validate the program's behavior and reasoning.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
