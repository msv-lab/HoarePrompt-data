The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop will iterate `t` times, the state needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted explicitly as it is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
