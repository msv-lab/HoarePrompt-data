The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that the input consists of multiple test cases, and for each test case, there are specific details about the number of houses and their preferences.

Since the code only reads the number of test cases and assigns it to `t`, the other variables (`n`, `a`, etc.) remain unchanged and are not yet initialized in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses. The second line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 indicates the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side, and a_j = 1 indicates the resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
