The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `num` is the integer value read from the input.**
