To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in the provided code is:

```python
for i in range(0, num):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `i` (the loop variable)
- `num` (the upper bound of the range)

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and will iterate up to, but not including, `num`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `num` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `num` is the integer value read from the input

We need to ensure that `num` is greater than 0 to make the loop execute. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `num` must be greater than 0**
