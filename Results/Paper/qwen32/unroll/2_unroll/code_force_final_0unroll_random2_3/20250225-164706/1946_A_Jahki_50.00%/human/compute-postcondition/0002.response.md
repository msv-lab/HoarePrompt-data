To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided code snippet and initial conditions.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs `num` times.
2. **Input Handling**: For each iteration, the code reads an integer `num2` and a string `case`.
3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `num2 > 10000`, the code prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to process the list `a` derived from `case`.
4. **Median Calculation**:
   - The list `a` is sorted.
   - The median is determined based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
5. **Median Adjustment**:
   - The code increments the median value in the sorted list until it exceeds the original median value, counting the number of operations (`op`).
6. **Output**:
   - The number of operations (`op`) required to adjust the median is printed for each iteration where `num2 <= 10000`.

### Output State:
The output state will depend on the values of `num2` and `case` for each iteration. However, the initial state variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `num`) remain unchanged unless directly modified within the loop. Since the loop modifies the list `a` locally within each iteration and does not affect the initial `a`, `t`, `n`, and `num`, the output state will reflect the final values of these variables.

Given that the loop does not modify `t`, `n`, and `num` directly and only modifies the local list `a` within each iteration, the output state will be:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; num is the integer value read from the input.**
