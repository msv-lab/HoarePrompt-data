The code reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state mentions `n` (number of vertices in the tree) and `k` (number of edges to be removed), but these are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `t` is the integer read from standard input.**
