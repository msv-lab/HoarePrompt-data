The initial state describes the values and constraints of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
2. The variables `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}`.
3. It is given that `n >= k` and `n != k`.
4. Additionally, `k - 1 >= n - k + 1` is provided as a condition.

Despite these constraints, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables. It simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
