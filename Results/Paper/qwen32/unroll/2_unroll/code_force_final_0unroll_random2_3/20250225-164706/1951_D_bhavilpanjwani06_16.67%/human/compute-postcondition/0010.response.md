The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several constraints on the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these constraints do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` and will always output the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The initial state provides constraints on the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these constraints do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **YES**
