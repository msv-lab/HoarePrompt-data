Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of cards each player receives. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
