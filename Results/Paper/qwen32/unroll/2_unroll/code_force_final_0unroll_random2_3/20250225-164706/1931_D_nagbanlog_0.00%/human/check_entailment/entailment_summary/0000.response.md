### Reasoning:
The function `func_1` aims to find the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array `a` for each test case. A pair \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The function uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) as it iterates through the array. For each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
- `mod_x`: the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y`: the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x`: the remainder that another element must have to satisfy the condition \((a_i + a_j) \% x == 0\) when paired with `num`. This is calculated as \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
- `required_mod_y`: the remainder that another element must have to satisfy the condition \((a_i - a_j) \% y == 0\) when paired with `num`. This is the same as `mod_y`.

The function then checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it means there are elements in the array that can form a beautiful pair with the current element, and it adds the frequency of such elements to the `beautiful_count`.

Finally, it updates the frequency of the current element's pair of remainders in the `freq` dictionary.

The function processes all test cases in a similar manner and returns the counts of beautiful pairs for each.

### Correctness:
The logic of the function seems correct based on the problem description. It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to track remainders and their frequencies, ensuring that it only iterates through the array once per test case, which is optimal given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
