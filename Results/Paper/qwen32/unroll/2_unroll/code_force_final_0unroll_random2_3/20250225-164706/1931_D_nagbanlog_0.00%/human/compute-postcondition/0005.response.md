Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and two additional integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of "beautiful pairs" within the list, where a "beautiful pair" is defined by specific modular conditions involving the additional integers. The function returns a list of counts, each corresponding to the number of beautiful pairs found in the respective test case.**
