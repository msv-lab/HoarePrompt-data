Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not properly transform and check the array elements to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
10 3 20 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The array is `[10, 3, 20, 1]`.
- We can split `10` into `1` and `0`, resulting in `[1, 0, 3, 20, 1]`.
- We can split `20` into `2` and `0`, resulting in `[1, 0, 3, 2, 0, 1]`.
- No matter how we split the numbers, it is impossible to sort the array in non-decreasing order because the `1` at the end will always be out of place.

**Program Output:**
The program will likely output `YES` for this input, which is incorrect.

The main issue in the program is that it does not correctly simulate the transformation process and check if the resulting array can be sorted. The logic of checking only the immediate previous element and its split is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted after any number of transformations.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as recursively splitting the numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
