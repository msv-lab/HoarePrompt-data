The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will change to whatever integer is provided by the input, but the constraints on `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and the other variables (`t`, and the list `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an integer provided by the input (2 <= n <= 50); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.**
