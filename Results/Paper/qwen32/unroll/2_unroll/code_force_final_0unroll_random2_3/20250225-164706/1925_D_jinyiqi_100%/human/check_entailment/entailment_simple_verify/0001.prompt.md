You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided solution.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs who are friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - For each of the `m` pairs, we have `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Process**:
   - For each excursion, a pair of children is chosen randomly.
   - If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The result should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its simplest form, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output one integer which is the answer to the problem.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - `M`: Modulo value \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **For each test case**:
   - Read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Calculate the sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`).
   - Calculate the total number of possible pairs (`cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`).
   - Calculate `p` and `q`:
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
   - Simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - Calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and print the result.

### Correctness:
The formula used for `p` and `q` in the program seems incorrect. Here's why:

- The expected value calculation should consider the probability of picking a friend pair and the probability of picking a non-friend pair.
- The given formula does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair over `k` excursions.
- Using combinatorial mathematics to compute the expected sum of friendship values.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
