For the given task, we need to adjust the state such that the for loop can execute. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `t`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.
2. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`, and `M` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.
3. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Given this, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ `m` ≤ min(10^5, `n`(`n`-1)/2), and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^5. The next `m` lines contain three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where `a_i` ≠ `b_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `f_i` ≤ 10^9. All pairs (`a_i`, `b_i`) are distinct. The sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1. `M` is 10**
