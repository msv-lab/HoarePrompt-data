Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions and outputs the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \), where \( \frac{p}{q} \) is the expected value expressed as a fraction in its simplest form.

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of integers representing pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The program calculates the sum of all initial friendship values `sum_f`.

3. **Total Possible Pairs**: It calculates the total number of possible pairs of children `cn2` using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot cn2^2 \).

5. **Simplification**: The program simplifies the fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor `gcd`.

6. **Modular Inverse**: It calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using Python's `pow` function with three arguments, which efficiently computes the modular inverse.

7. **Output**: Finally, it prints the result of \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

The formula used for `p` and `q` seems to be derived from the expected value calculation for the given problem. The calculation of the expected value considers both the initial friendship values and the incremental increase in friendship values due to the random selection of pairs over `k` excursions.

However, the formula provided in the code does not match the expected value formula derived from the problem statement. The correct formula for the expected value should consider the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in friendship values. The provided formula appears to be incorrect.

Given the problem statement and the expected output, the formula used in the code is likely incorrect. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
