### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's re-evaluate the problem and the program's logic step-by-step.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
- **Expected Output**: The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its simplest form, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates `p` and `q` using the following formulas:
- `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

Let's break down the correctness of these formulas:

1. **Total number of possible pairs (`cn2`)**:
   - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` is correct. This is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.

2. **Sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`)**:
   - `sum_f` is correctly calculated as the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i`.

3. **Formulas for `p` and `q`**:
   - The formula for `p` and `q` does not correctly account for the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The provided formula does not consider the probability of picking a friend pair and the probability of picking a non-friend pair.
   - The increase in friendship values over multiple excursions is not correctly modeled.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to:
1. **Calculate the expected contribution of each friend pair**:
   - The probability of picking a specific friend pair in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{cn2}\).
   - The expected number of times a specific friend pair is picked in `k` excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{1}{cn2}\).
   - The expected contribution of a friend pair with initial friendship value `f_i` is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(f_i + (f_i + 1) + (f_i + 2) + \ldots + (f_i + k - 1)\).
   - The sum of this series is \(k \cdot f_i + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).

2. **Sum the expected contributions of all friend pairs**:
   - The total expected sum of friendship values is the sum of the expected contributions of all `m` friend pairs.

3. **Calculate the expected contribution of non-friend pairs**:
   - The probability of picking a non-friend pair in one excursion is \(\frac{cn2 - m}{cn2}\).
   - The expected number of times a specific non-friend pair is picked in `k` excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{cn2 - m}{cn2}\).
   - The expected contribution of a non-friend pair is 0.

4. **Formulate the expected value**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values is the sum of the expected contributions of all friend pairs.
   - This can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where `p` is the total expected sum and `q` is the total number of possible outcomes.

5. **Simplify the fraction and compute the modular inverse**:
   - Simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - Calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement. The formulas for `p` and `q` are incorrect and do not account for the expected behavior of friendship values over multiple excursions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
