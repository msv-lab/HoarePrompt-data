Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` represents the number of nodes, `m` represents the number of edges, and `k` is an additional integer parameter. It also accepts `m` lines of three integers each, representing the edges between nodes and a value associated with each edge. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints. Case_1: If the input values are within the specified constraints, the function performs a computation and returns a specific result. Case_2: If the input values do not meet the constraints, the behavior is not specified in the given information.**
