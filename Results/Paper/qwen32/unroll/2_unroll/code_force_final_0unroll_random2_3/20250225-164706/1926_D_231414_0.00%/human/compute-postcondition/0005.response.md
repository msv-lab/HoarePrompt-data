Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` for each integer in the list, which represents the count of unique integers in the list up to that point after applying a specific transformation (XOR with `2^31 - 1`).**
