To determine the output state after the loop execution, let's first understand the provided code:

```python
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')
```

This loop iterates over each element in the list `b` and prints each element without adding a newline after each print statement due to `end=''`.

Given that the loop only prints the elements of `b` and does not modify the list `b` or any other variables, the output state will be the sequence of elements in `b` printed in a single line.

Since the initial state only mentions modifications to `a` and does not provide the initial values of `b`, we will assume `b` is provided and will describe the output state based on the elements of `b`.

Let's assume `b` is some list of elements, for example, `b = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`.

The loop will print: `Hello` in a single line.

Therefore, the output state will be the printed sequence of elements in `b`.

Output State: **the sequence of elements in `b` printed in a single line.**

If we assume `b = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']` as an example:

Output State: **Hello**
