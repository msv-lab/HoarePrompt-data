Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. The function returns the number of pairs of adjacent coins that are facing the same direction for each test case.**
