Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers that sum up to `x`. The GCD of the set of integers is the largest number that divides all the integers in the set.

### Key Observations
1. **Divisibility**: For a number `d` to be the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties, `x` must be divisible by `d`. This is because the sum of the difficulties must be `x`, and if each difficulty is a multiple of `d`, their sum must also be a multiple of `d`.
2. **Maximum GCD**: The maximum possible GCD `d` must satisfy two conditions:
   - `x` is divisible by `d`.
   - It is possible to split `x` into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `d`.

### Strategy
To find the maximum GCD `d`:
- Iterate through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
- For each divisor `i`, check if it can be the GCD by verifying if `x // i` is at least `n` (which means we can have `n` parts each of at least `i` difficulty) or if `i` itself is at least `n` (which means we can have `n` parts each of at least `x // i` difficulty).
- The largest such `i` or `x // i` that satisfies these conditions is the maximum possible GCD.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above strategy.

```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Correctness Check
1. **Iterate through Divisors**: The loop `for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1)` correctly iterates through all divisors of `x` up to its square root.
2. **Check Divisibility**: The condition `if x % i == 0` ensures that `i` is a divisor of `x`.
3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - `if n <= x // i`: This checks if we can have `n` parts each of at least `i` difficulty.
   - `elif n <= i`: This checks if we can have `n` parts each of at least `x // i` difficulty.
4. **Update Maximum GCD**: The `ans = max(ans, i)` and `ans = max(ans, x // i)` lines correctly update the maximum possible GCD.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to find the maximum possible GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties.

**Correctness: True**
