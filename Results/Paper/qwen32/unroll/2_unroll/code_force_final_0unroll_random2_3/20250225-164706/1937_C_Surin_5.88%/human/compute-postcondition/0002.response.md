The only variables in the loop head are `kp` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `kp` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop header.

The state of `R` (the lambda function) does not affect the execution of this loop, as it is not used in the loop header.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be at least 1.

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list of integers, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1**
