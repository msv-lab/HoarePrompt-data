You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` does not take any input parameters directly. Instead, it interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a secret permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can issue queries in the form of "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n to receive comparisons of bitwise OR operations on elements of `p`. The function must find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, using at most 3n queries per test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: the final values of `prev` and `v1` after the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not accept any direct input parameters. It interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of a secret permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can issue up to 3n queries per test case in the form of "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of `p`. The goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
