The function `func()` does not take any input parameters directly. Instead, it interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a secret permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can issue queries in the form of "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n to receive comparisons of bitwise OR operations on elements of `p`. The function must find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, using at most 3n queries per test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
