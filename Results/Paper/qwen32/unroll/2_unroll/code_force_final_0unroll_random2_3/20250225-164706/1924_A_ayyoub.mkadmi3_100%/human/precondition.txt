s is a string of length m, where m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. n and k are integers such that (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) representing the number of test cases. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
