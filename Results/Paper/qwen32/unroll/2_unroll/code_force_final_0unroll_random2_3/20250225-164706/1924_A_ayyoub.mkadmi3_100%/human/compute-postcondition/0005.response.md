The code calculates the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k` and assigns the result to `r`. The values of `s1`, `s2`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is the same as the input string `s`, `s2` contains characters from `s` that were the last remaining character in alphabet at any point, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.**
