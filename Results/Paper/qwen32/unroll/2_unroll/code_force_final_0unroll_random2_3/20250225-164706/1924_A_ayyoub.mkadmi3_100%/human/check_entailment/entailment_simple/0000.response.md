### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by using a function `func_1` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can occur as subsequences in the given string `s`. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and `alphabet` as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and if the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element. If `alphabet` has only one element, it adds the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a tuple containing this boolean result, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.

2. **Issues with the logic**:
   - The function does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` can occur as subsequences in `s`. It only checks if `s1` is long enough, which is not sufficient.
   - The construction of `s2` and the logic to find a missing string are flawed. The code attempts to find a missing string by checking characters in `s1` and `s2`, but this does not guarantee that it finds a string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Correct approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if every possible string of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets is a subsequence of `s`.
   - One way to do this is to generate all possible strings of length `n` and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.

Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness: **False**
