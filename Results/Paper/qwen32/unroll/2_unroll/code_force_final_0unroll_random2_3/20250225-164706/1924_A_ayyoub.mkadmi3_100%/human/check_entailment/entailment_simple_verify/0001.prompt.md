You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. If not, we need to provide a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` (the length of the string `s`).
   - It reads the string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It calls the function `func_1(s, k, n)` which is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a tuple `(b, s1, s2)` where `b` is a boolean indicating if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, and `s1` and `s2` are some intermediate strings.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `b` is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
     - It attempts to find a character in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using this character.
     - It appends 'No' and the constructed string to the output list.
   - If `b` is `True`, it appends 'Yes' to the output list.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. The logic inside `func_1` is not aligned with the problem requirements.

- **Incorrect Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` attempts to build `s1` and `s2` by removing characters from an alphabet set, but this does not help in checking subsequences of length `n`.
  - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not a valid check for the problem.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print 'No' followed by that string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print 'Yes'.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
