Functionality: **The function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and returns a tuple. The tuple contains a boolean indicating if the length of the processed string `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from a calculated index, and a string `s2` that includes characters which were the last remaining in the set of allowed alphabets at any point during processing.**
