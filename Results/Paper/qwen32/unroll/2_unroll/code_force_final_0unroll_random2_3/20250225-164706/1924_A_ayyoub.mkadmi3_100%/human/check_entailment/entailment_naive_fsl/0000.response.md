Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` does not properly check whether all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - The function seems to try to build a substring `s1` and `s2` but does not correctly ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Subsequence Check**:
   - The logic to check if a string of length `n` is a subsequence of `s` is missing. The function `func_1` does not perform any kind of subsequence checking.
   - The function incorrectly assumes that if `s1` is long enough, then all possible strings of length `n` are covered, which is not the case.

3. **Generating the Missing String**:
   - The logic to generate a string that is not a subsequence of `s` is also flawed. It simply tries to find a character not in `s1` and repeats it, which does not guarantee that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
The expected output is:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the provided code will likely not generate `aa` as the missing subsequence because the logic in `func_1` is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print `NO` followed by that string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print `YES`.

This requires a more robust approach to check for subsequences and generating the correct missing string if needed.
