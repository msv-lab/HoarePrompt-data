### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no facing-up coins remain, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The task is to determine if Alice (who goes first) will win if both players play optimally.

2. **Game Analysis:**
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ("U") determines the winner.
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice will win.
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob will win.
   - This is because each move reduces the number of "U" coins by 1 (since a "U" coin is removed) and potentially changes the state of two adjacent coins (but does not change the overall parity of "U" coins).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads the input and parses it into a list of test cases. Each test case is represented as a tuple containing the number of coins and the string of coin states.
     - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `s`, then appends the tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`.
     - Finally, it returns the list `cases`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function takes a single test case and determines the winner.
     - It counts the number of "U" coins in the string `case[1]`.
     - It returns "YES" if the count of "U" coins is odd, and "NO" otherwise.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins.
   - Both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided input/output examples.
