You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        cases.append((n, s))
    return cases

#Function 2:
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum((1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U'))
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

cases = func_1()
for case in cases:
    print(func_2(case))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of coins, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: `n` is the number of coins from the last test case, `s` is the string "U" and "D" from the last test case, `t` is the integer read from the standard input, `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the number of coins and the corresponding string for each test case.
    return cases
    #The program returns `cases`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the number of coins and the corresponding string for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the integer `n` and the string `s` for each test case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a tuple where the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in the string `case[1]` is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `case` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in the string is odd; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether it correctly implements the logic to decide who will win the game based on the provided problem description.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The key insight in the problem is that the game's outcome can be determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.
   - This is because each move flips an even number of coins (either 2 or 0, depending on the number of coins left), so the parity of the number of facing-up coins remains the same after each move.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the input and stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in the list `cases`.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function takes a test case `(n, s)`, counts the number of `'U'` in the string `s`, and returns `'YES'` if the count is odd and `'NO'` if it is even.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic used in `func_2` is correct based on the problem's analysis. The parity of the number of `'U'` determines the winner.
   - The input reading and processing in `func_1` are also correctly implemented to handle multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
