### Reasoning:
The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads the input and organizes it into a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing the number of coins and the string representing the coins' states. `func_2` then determines the winner for each test case based on the number of facing-up coins ('U').

The key insight in the problem is that the winner of the game can be determined by counting the number of 'U' characters in the string:
- If the number of 'U' characters is odd, Alice will win.
- If the number of 'U' characters is even, Bob will win.

This is because each move removes one 'U' and flips the adjacent coins, which does not change the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of 'U' coins. Therefore, the parity of the number of 'U' coins at the start of the game determines the winner.

The provided code correctly implements this logic in `func_2` by counting the 'U' characters and checking if the count is odd or even.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
