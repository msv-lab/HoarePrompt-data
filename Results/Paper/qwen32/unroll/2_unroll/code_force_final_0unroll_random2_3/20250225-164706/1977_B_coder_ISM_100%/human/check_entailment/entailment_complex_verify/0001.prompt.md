You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a positive integer `x` less than 2^30. For each test case, it modifies the binary representation of `x` according to specific rules and outputs the length of the modified binary string followed by the modified binary string itself.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n-2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i+1} \neq 0\). Specifically, the program does not ensure that no two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 1
```
or
```
3
1 0 1
```
or any other valid representation where no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
1 1
```

In this case, the output `1 1` is incorrect because it violates the condition that no two consecutive elements should be non-zero.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to ensure that when it sets a position to `1` or `-1`, it checks the adjacent positions to ensure they are `0` before setting the current position. Additionally, the program should handle edge cases properly, such as when the input is a power of 2 or when the input requires the use of `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x % 2 == 1:
                if length > 0 and s[-1] != 0:
                    s[-1] = -1
                    x += 1
                s.append(1)
            else:
                s.append(0)
            x //= 2
            length += 1
        print(length)
        print(*s)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that no two consecutive elements are non-zero by adjusting the previous element to `-1` if necessary when setting the current element to `1`.
