You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24
    
    15

Output

    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array `a` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 32`), such that each element in `a` is either `1`, `0`, or `-1`.
- The array must satisfy `x = Σ(a_i * 2^i)` for a given positive integer `x` (where `1 ≤ x < 2^30`).
- No two consecutive elements in `a` should be non-zero.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x`.

2. **Initial Binary Representation**:
   - The program converts `x` into a binary string `s` of length 30, where each element is either `'1'` or `'0'` based on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set.

3. **Adjusting the Array**:
   - The program then iterates through the binary representation to adjust it according to the rules:
     - If two consecutive `'1'`s are found, the first `'1'` is replaced with `'-1'` and the second `'1'` is replaced with `'0'`.
     - If it encounters a `'1'` that is not followed by another `'1'` and a flag is set, it sets that `'1'` to `'0'` and sets the next element to `'1'`.
     - If the last element is `'0'` and the flag is set, it sets the last element to `'1'`.
     - If the last element is `'1'` and the flag is set, it sets the last element to `'0'` and appends an additional `'1'` to the array, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program ensures that no two consecutive elements are non-zero by swapping `'1'`s and `'-1'`s as necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Correctness Check:

- **Binary Conversion**:
  - The initial binary conversion is correct, but it only considers `'1'`s and `'0'`s, not `'-1'`s.

- **Adjustment Logic**:
  - The adjustment logic aims to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero by replacing `'1'`s with `'-1'`s and `'0'`s as needed.
  - This logic is generally correct, but there are some edge cases that need to be handled properly (e.g., when the last element is `'1'` and the flag is set, it correctly appends an additional `'1'`).

- **Output**:
  - The output format is correct, printing the length of the array and the array itself.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly adjust the binary representation of `x` to meet the problem's requirements, ensuring that no two consecutive elements are non-zero and that the sum of the array elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals `x`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
