### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful, i.e., to remove all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".

The provided function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Counts the number of occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s`.
2. Removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s`.
3. Counts the number of occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` (after removing "map").
4. Prints the sum of these two counts.

The function seems to assume that each occurrence of "map" and "pie" are independent and can be counted and removed separately. However, this approach is flawed because the removal of one substring might affect the occurrence of another substring.

For example, consider the string "mappie". If we first count and remove "map", we get "pie", which is then counted as an occurrence of "pie". However, if we first remove "pie", we get "map", which should be counted as an occurrence of "map". The correct approach should account for overlapping and intertwined occurrences of "map" and "pie".

The given function does not handle such cases correctly and might overestimate the number of deletions required. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
