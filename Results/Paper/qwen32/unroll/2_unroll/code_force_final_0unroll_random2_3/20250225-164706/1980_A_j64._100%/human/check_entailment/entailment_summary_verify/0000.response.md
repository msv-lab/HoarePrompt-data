### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and function summary to determine if the program correctly meets the problem description.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `a` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program initializes a list `count` of length 7 to store the counts of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - It iterates through the string `a`, updating the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem. The mapping from character to index is done using `ord(char) - ord('A')`, which correctly maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, ..., 'G' to 6.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems:**
   - The program initializes `needed_problems` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the `count` list. For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - count[i])` to `needed_problems`. This correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` problems per round.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the `needed_problems` for each test case.

#### Function Summary:

The function `func_1` calculates and returns the total number of additional occurrences needed for each character in the string `a` to reach at least `m` occurrences, where `a` consists of characters from 'A' to 'G'. This aligns with the problem's requirements.

#### Verification with Examples:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
  - `count` after processing: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
  - `needed_problems`: `2` (for 'A' and 'F')
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
  - `count` after processing: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
  - `needed_problems`: `5` (for 'A', 'B', 'F', 'F', 'G')
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
  - `count` after processing: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`
  - `needed_problems`: `1` (for 'A')
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Edge Cases:

- **All Problems of Same Difficulty:**
  - Input: `10 1 AAAAAAAAAA`
  - `count` after processing: `[10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `needed_problems`: `6` (for 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G')
  - Output: `6` (Correct)

- **No Problems:**
  - Input: `0 1`
  - `count` after processing: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - `needed_problems`: `7` (for 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G')
  - Output: `7` (Correct)

- **Maximum Problems:**
  - Input: `50 5 ABBBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEFFFFFFFFFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
