Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and outputting \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
   - It calculates the result by iterating over each friendship and adding the product of the friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is given by the formula \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\).
   - The result is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

   The formula used for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is correct, and the function correctly computes the contribution of each friendship to the total expected value. However, there is a critical oversight: the function does not account for the fact that the friendship values increase over time as pairs are chosen. The correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over the `k` excursions, which is not addressed by simply summing the initial friendship values multiplied by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and the list of friendships.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

   The function correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases, but its correctness is dependent on the correctness of `func_1`.

Given the analysis, `func_1` does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values because it does not account for the dynamic increase in friendship values as pairs are chosen over the `k` excursions. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
