To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and the function `func_1`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, which means we cannot directly compute the result of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. 

Given the loop executes `t` times, it will read new values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` in each iteration and print the result of `func_1` for those inputs. Since the function `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the state in terms of the loop's behavior and the inputs it processes.

After the loop finishes all `t` iterations, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will reflect the last iteration's input. The state of other variables that are not modified within the loop will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `t` will be 0 (or whatever value it was initialized to before the loop started, if it was used elsewhere). All other variables not mentioned in the loop will remain in their initial state.**
