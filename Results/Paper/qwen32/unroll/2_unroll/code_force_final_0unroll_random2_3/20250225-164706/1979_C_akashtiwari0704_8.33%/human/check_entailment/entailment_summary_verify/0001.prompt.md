You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = 1
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. It calculates a product of the integers in `k`, then computes a new list where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in `k`. It checks if the sum of this new list is greater than or equal to the product. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the new list of computed values, separated by spaces.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - The program calculates the product `prod` of all multipliers `a[i]`.
   - This product is intended to be used to compute the bets for each outcome.

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - For each outcome `i`, the program sets `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`.
   - This is an attempt to distribute the bets such that the total of these bets is less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
   - The sum of these bets is then computed and stored in `sumo`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `sumo` (total of the bets) is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1`, indicating it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Bets:**
  - The program calculates each bet as `prod // a[i]`. This does not guarantee that the total of these bets will be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
  - For example, if `a = [3, 2, 7]`, `prod = 42`, and the bets calculated are `[14, 21, 6]`, the total is `41`, which is less than `42`, but this is not guaranteed for all cases.
  - The program does not ensure that `sumo < prod // a[i]` for each `i`.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The program correctly formats the output by joining the bets with spaces, but this is not the main issue.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the total of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. One simple and correct way to do this is to set each bet `x_i` to `1` and check if `n < k_i` for all `i`. If this condition is met, it's possible to distribute the bets as required; otherwise, it's not.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly ensure that the total of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
