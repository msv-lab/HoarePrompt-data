Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The logic in the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The function simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal splitting of the array as described in the problem.

To find the minimum penalty, we need to consider different ways to split the array and calculate the penalty for each split. The optimal solution involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach that considers the cumulative sums and penalties incurred by splitting the array at different points. The current solution, however, does not implement any such logic and thus does not provide the correct minimum penalty.

Correctness: **False**
