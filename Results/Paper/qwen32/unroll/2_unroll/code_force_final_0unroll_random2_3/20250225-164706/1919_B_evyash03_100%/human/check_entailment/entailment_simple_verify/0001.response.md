### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. The program merely calculates the absolute difference between the counts of `+` and `-` characters in the string, which does not address the requirement to split the string into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

To solve the problem optimally, the program should consider splitting the string into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is zero, as this would minimize the penalty for each subarray to zero. If it's not possible to create subarrays with a sum of zero, the program should aim to create subarrays with the smallest possible absolute sum.

The provided program does not implement any logic for subarray splitting or penalty calculation based on the described rules. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
