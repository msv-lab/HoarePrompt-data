Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty as described in the problem. The function `func_1` simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

To solve the problem optimally, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that considers the running sum and splits the array when the running sum is zero (or as close to zero as possible) would be necessary. The provided code does not implement such a strategy.
