Reasoning:  
The provided program seems to be attempting to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. However, the logic within the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game. The game is essentially a variant of the Nim game, and the winning strategy is based on the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally. Otherwise, the player is in a winning position.

The provided program instead calculates the "mex" (minimum excludant) of the sorted pile sizes and uses it to determine the winner, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes for each test case and print "Alice" if the Nim-sum is non-zero (indicating Alice can force a win) and "Bob" if the Nim-sum is zero (indicating Bob can force a win).

Given the incorrect logic, the program does not always produce the correct output, even though it might work for some specific test cases by chance.

Correctness: **False**
