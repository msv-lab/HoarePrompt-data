#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers where k is between 1 and 100, and the integers are in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100. b is a list of q integers where q is between 1 and 100, and each integer in b is between 1 and 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #a list where each element of the original list `a` is decreased by 1
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns list `b` which contains q integers where q is between 1 and 100, and each integer in `b` is between 1 and 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers. If the list `a` is considered less than or equal to the list `b` (based on lexicographical order), it returns a new list where each element of `a` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
