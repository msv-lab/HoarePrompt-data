Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers. If the list `a` is considered less than or equal to the list `b` (based on lexicographical order), it returns a new list where each element of `a` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.**
