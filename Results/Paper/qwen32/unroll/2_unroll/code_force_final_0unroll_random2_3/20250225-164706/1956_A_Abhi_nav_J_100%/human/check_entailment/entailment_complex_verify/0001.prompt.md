You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers where k is between 1 and 100, and the integers are in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100. b is a list of q integers where q is between 1 and 100, and each integer in b is between 1 and 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #a list where each element of the original list `a` is decreased by 1
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns list `b` which contains q integers where q is between 1 and 100, and each integer in `b` is between 1 and 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers. If the list `a` is considered less than or equal to the list `b` (based on lexicographical order), it returns a new list where each element of `a` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic for Kicking Players:**
   - The problem requires finding and removing players at specific positions (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_k`) in each round. If a position is beyond the current number of players, it should be skipped.
   - The provided `func_1` function, which is supposed to determine the number of winners, is incorrectly implemented. It only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and does not simulate the game rounds as described.

2. **Simulation of Rounds:**
   - The game involves multiple rounds where players are removed based on the sequence `a`. The program should simulate these rounds and keep track of the remaining players until no more players can be removed.
   - The current implementation does not simulate these rounds and incorrectly returns the number of winners based on a simple comparison.

3. **Iterating Over `q` Values:**
   - For each value of `n_i` (number of players), the program should independently determine the number of winners. The provided code incorrectly uses only the first element of the sequence `a` to determine the number of winners for all `n_i`.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program should output the number of winners for each `n_i` on a new line, separated by spaces. The current implementation does this correctly, but the underlying logic is flawed.

Given the issues with the logic and the simulation of the game rounds, the provided program is incorrect.
