Postcondition: **a is a list of k integers where k is between 1 and 100, and the integers are in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100. b is a list of q integers where q is between 1 and 100, and each integer in b is between 1 and 100. The list a is not less than or equal to the list b, meaning there exists at least one position where an element in a is greater than the corresponding element in b or a is longer than b.**
