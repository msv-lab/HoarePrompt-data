Reasoning:  
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic for Kicking Players:**
   - The problem requires finding and removing players at specific positions (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_k`) in each round. If a position is beyond the current number of players, it should be skipped.
   - The provided `func_1` function, which is supposed to determine the number of winners, is incorrectly implemented. It only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and does not simulate the game rounds as described.

2. **Simulation of Rounds:**
   - The game involves multiple rounds where players are removed based on the sequence `a`. The program should simulate these rounds and keep track of the remaining players until no more players can be removed.
   - The current implementation does not simulate these rounds and incorrectly returns the number of winners based on a simple comparison.

3. **Iterating Over `q` Values:**
   - For each value of `n_i` (number of players), the program should independently determine the number of winners. The provided code incorrectly uses only the first element of the sequence `a` to determine the number of winners for all `n_i`.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program should output the number of winners for each `n_i` on a new line, separated by spaces. The current implementation does this correctly, but the underlying logic is flawed.

Given the issues with the logic and the simulation of the game rounds, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
