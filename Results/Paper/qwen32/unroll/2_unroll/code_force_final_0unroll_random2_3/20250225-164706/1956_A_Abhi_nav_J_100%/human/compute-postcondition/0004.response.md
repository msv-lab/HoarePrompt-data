Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of k integers where k is between 1 and 100, and the integers are in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100. `b` is a list of q integers where q is between 1 and 100, and each integer in `b` is between 1 and 100. The function returns a list where each element of the original list `a` is decreased by 1 if a certain condition is met (Case_1); otherwise, it returns list `b` (Case_2).**
