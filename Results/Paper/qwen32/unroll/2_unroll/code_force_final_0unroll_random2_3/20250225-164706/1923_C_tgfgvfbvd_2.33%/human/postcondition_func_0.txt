The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. It then processes `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, to determine if the sum of the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) is at least twice the length of the subarray. The function outputs 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise 'NO'.
