The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function does not modify any existing variables or introduce new ones other than `r` itself. Therefore, the initial state remains largely unchanged except for the introduction of the `r` function.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; additionally, for each city, the closest city is uniquely determined; `r` is a lambda function that maps input integers.**
