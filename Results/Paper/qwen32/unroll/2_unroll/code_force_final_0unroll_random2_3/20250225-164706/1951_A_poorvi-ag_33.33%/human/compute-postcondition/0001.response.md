The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `t` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the initialized `results` list along with the unchanged `start`, `end`, and `t`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.**
