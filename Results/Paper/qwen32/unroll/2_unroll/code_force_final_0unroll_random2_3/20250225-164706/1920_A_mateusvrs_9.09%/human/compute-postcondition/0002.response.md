The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

The constraints provided are related to a variable `k`, but since `k` is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution directly, we do not need to adjust its state. The constraints on `k` are irrelevant to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `r` is an empty list `[]`**
