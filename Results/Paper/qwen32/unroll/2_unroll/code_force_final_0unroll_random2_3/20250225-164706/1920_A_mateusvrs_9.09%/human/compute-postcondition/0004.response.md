To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
The initial state is described as `[result1, result2, ..., result_t]`. This implies that there is a list of elements named `result1`, `result2`, ..., `result_t`. The variable `r` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but based on the print statement, we can infer that `r` must be a reference to this list.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(*r, sep='\n')
```
Here, the asterisk `*` before `r` is used to unpack the list `r` so that each element of the list is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function. The `sep='\n'` argument specifies that each element should be printed on a new line.

### Analysis:
Given that `r` is a list `[result1, result2, ..., result_t]`, the `print` statement will print each element of the list on a new line.

### Output:
The output will be each element of the list `r` printed on a new line.

Output: **result1
result2
...
result_t (where result1, result2, ..., result_t are the elements of the list `r`)**
