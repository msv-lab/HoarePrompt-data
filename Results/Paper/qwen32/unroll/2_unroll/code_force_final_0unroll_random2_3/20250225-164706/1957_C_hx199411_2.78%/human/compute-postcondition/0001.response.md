To determine the state that allows the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the variable `t` in the condition `while t:`. The loop will execute if `t` is a non-zero value. Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer and thus non-zero.

Since `t` is already ensured to be a positive integer within the given constraints, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
