You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if the input `password` string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits come before letters, and both digits and letters are individually in ascending order. It returns `True` if the password meets these conditions, otherwise it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
A password is considered strong if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. It consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit comes after a letter.
3. All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis

The program is structured as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.
3. It calls `func_1(password)` to check if the password is strong.
4. `func_1`:
   - Separates the digits and letters.
   - Sorts the digits and letters.
   - Checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - Checks if the last digit is not greater than any letter.
   - Constructs a sorted password from the digits and letters and compares it to the original password.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Digit and Letter Order Check**: The program checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, but it does not ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the original password. For example, the password "a1b" should be "NO" because '1' comes after 'a'.
2. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program constructs a sorted password and compares it to the original password. However, this approach does not correctly handle the requirement that no digit should come after a letter in the original password.

### Correctness
The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the requirement that no digit should come after a letter in the original password.

### Counterexample
Consider the password "a1b":
- The program will separate the digits and letters, sort them, and then check the conditions.
- It will find that the digits are sorted and the letters are sorted.
- It will also find that the last digit (1) is not greater than any letter (a, b).
- However, the original password "a1b" has a digit (1) coming after a letter (a), which violates the requirement.

### Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of the Correctness
The program should iterate through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If it finds such a case, it should immediately return "NO". Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    found_digit = False
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit():
            found_digit = True
        if found_digit and password[i+1].isalpha():
            return False
    if found_digit:
        digits = [char for char in password if char.isdigit()]
        if digits != sorted(digits):
            return False
    letters = [char for char in password if char.isalpha()]
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that no digit comes after a letter and that both digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
