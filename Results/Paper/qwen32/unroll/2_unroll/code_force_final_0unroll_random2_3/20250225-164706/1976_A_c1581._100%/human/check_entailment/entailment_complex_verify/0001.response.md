### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided code. The function `func_1` does not properly verify that no digit appears after a letter in the original password. Instead, it only checks if the last digit in the sorted list of digits is less than or equal to the first letter in the sorted list of letters. This check is insufficient to ensure that the digits do not appear after any letters in the original password sequence.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function correctly separates digits and letters into two separate lists.
2. **Sorting**: The function correctly sorts both the `digits` and `letters` lists.
3. **Validation**:
   - The function checks if the sorted `digits` list is in non-decreasing order, which is redundant because the list is already sorted.
   - The function checks if the last digit in the sorted `digits` list is less than or equal to the first letter in the sorted `letters` list. This check does not ensure that the original password does not have a digit after a letter.
   - The function constructs a `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and checks if this matches the original password. This check ensures that the digits and letters are individually sorted and that digits come before letters, but it does not ensure the order within the original password.

To correctly implement the problem's requirements, the function should verify that:
- All digits come before any letters in the original password.
- All digits in the password are in non-decreasing order.
- All letters in the password are in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    found_letter = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if found_letter:
                return False  # A digit comes after a letter
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            found_letter = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits are sorted
    for i in range(1, len(digits)):
        if digits[i] < digits[i - 1]:
            return False
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    for i in range(1, len(letters)):
        if letters[i] < letters[i - 1]:
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Final: **False**
The original program is incorrect due to the insufficient validation of the condition that no digit should come after a letter in the original password. Therefore, the final assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.
