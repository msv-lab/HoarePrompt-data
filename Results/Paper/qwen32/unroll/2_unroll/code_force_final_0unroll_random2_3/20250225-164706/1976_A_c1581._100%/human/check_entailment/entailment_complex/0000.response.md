### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement:

1. **Separation and Sorting:**
   - The program separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both `digits` and `letters` in non-decreasing order.

2. **Validation of Conditions:**
   - **Condition 2:** The program checks if there's a digit after a letter by comparing the last digit in the sorted `digits` list with each letter in the sorted `letters` list. This is not the correct approach. The correct check should be to ensure that the password does not have any digit after a letter, not comparing the sorted lists.
   - **Condition 3 and 4:** The program ensures that both `digits` and `letters` are sorted in non-decreasing order by sorting them explicitly.
   - **Reconstruction and Comparison:** The program reconstructs the password by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` and checks if it matches the original password. This ensures that all digits come before letters and both are sorted.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program incorrectly checks if a digit comes after a letter by comparing the last digit with each letter. Instead, it should ensure that the transition from letters to digits is seamless and that there are no digits after any letters in the original password.

### Correct Approach:
- Iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digits should appear afterward.
- Ensure that the digits and letters encountered are in non-decreasing order.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_letter = False
    prev_digit = '0'
    prev_letter = 'a'
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if seen_letter:
                return False
            if char < prev_digit:
                return False
            prev_digit = char
        else:
            seen_letter = True
            if char < prev_letter:
                return False
            prev_letter = char
    
    return True
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly check for the condition that no digit should come after a letter in the original password. It only checks the sorted lists, which is not sufficient.

**Correctness: False**
