Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter in the password. The function `func_1` does not properly check this condition. Instead, it only checks that digits are sorted and letters are sorted, and that the last digit is not greater than the first letter, which is not sufficient.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_letter = False
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit() and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return False
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            seen_letter = True
        if seen_letter and password[i].isdigit() and password[i] > password[i + 1]:
            return False
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i] > password[i + 1]:
            return False
    if password[-1].isdigit() and seen_letter:
        return False
    return True
```

This function checks that no digit comes after a letter and ensures that both letters and digits are in non-decreasing order.
