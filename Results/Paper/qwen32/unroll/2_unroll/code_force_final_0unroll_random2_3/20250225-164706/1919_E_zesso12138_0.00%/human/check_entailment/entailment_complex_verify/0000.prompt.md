You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it correctly counts the number of initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p` modulo 998,244,353.

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the prefix sums `p`.
   - It initializes a `dp` array where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach the prefix sum `j - offset` (where `offset = n` to handle negative indices).
   - It iterates through each element in `p` and updates the `dp` array based on the possible transitions (either adding 1 or subtracting 1).
   - Finally, it returns the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum `p[-1]`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and stores the result.
   - It then prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis

The code seems to follow the problem description correctly by using dynamic programming to count the number of valid initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, which correctly represents the starting point of the prefix sums.
2. **Transitions**: The code correctly updates the `dp` array by considering the two possible transitions (adding 1 or subtracting 1) for each prefix sum.
3. **Final Result**: The final result is correctly taken from `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the value of the last element in `p` adjusted by the offset.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure the result does not overflow.

### Testing

Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `1\n0`
   - Output: `0`
   - The code correctly returns `0` because there is no way to form a prefix sum of `0` with an array of size `1`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `1\n1`
   - Output: `1`
   - The code correctly returns `1` because the only array `[1]` can form a prefix sum of `1`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `3\n-1 1 2`
   - Output: `0`
   - The code correctly returns `0` because there is no way to form the prefix sums `[-1, 1, 2]` with an array of size `3`.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `5\n-1 0 0 1 1`
   - Output: `3`
   - The code correctly returns `3` because there are three valid arrays that can form the prefix sums `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `5\n-4 -3 -3 -2 -1`
   - Output: `1`
   - The code correctly returns `1` because there is only one valid array `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]` that can form the prefix sums `[-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`.

Based on the analysis and testing with the provided examples, the code appears to be correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p` modulo 998,244,353. It handles all the test cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately.
