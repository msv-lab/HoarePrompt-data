The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `input`, `data`, `index`, `t`). Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of the `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`; `input` holds the entire input provided as a string; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
