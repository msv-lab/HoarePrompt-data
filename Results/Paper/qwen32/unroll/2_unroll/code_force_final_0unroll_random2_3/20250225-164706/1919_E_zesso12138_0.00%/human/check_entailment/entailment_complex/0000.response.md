### Reasoning:

The provided code consists of two main functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are designed to solve the problem of counting the number of initial arrays `a` that result in a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
- **Input**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- **Output**: For each test case, it prints the result obtained from `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- **Logic**:
  - It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with all zeros and sets `dp[n]` to 1. This `dp` array is used to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
  - It iterates over each element in the prefix sum array `p` and updates the `dp` array based on the previous state. Specifically, for each possible prefix sum `j`, it updates the counts for `j + 1` and `j - 1` by adding the count at `j`.
  - Finally, it returns the value at the index `final_sum` in the `dp` array, which is determined by `p[-1] + offset` (where `offset` is `n`).

### Analysis:
- **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[n] = 1`, representing the starting point where the prefix sum is 0.
- **DP Update**: For each step, the DP array is updated to reflect the possible prefix sums that can be reached by adding or subtracting 1 from the current prefix sums.
- **Final Calculation**: The final result is obtained by looking at the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p` (adjusted by the offset `n`).

### Correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` is based on dynamic programming and correctly handles the transitions between prefix sums.
- The handling of the offset `n` ensures that the index calculations are within the bounds of the `dp` array.
- The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the implementation appears to correctly count the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
