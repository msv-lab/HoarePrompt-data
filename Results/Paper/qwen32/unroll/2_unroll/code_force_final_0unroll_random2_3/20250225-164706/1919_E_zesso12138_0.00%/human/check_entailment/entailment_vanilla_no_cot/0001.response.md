Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to count the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that the sorted prefix sums of `a` match a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The result should be given modulo `998,244,353`.

### Explanation of the Program

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum.
   - `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to have a prefix sum of `j - offset` where `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices.
   - The initial state is `dp[offset] = 1` since the prefix sum of an empty array is `0`.

2. **Transition**:
   - For each element in the array, the prefix sum can either increase by `1` or decrease by `1`.
   - This is handled by updating `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` based on the current `dp[j]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After processing all elements, the value at `dp[final_sum]` (where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus the `offset`) gives the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sums.

### Verification of the Program

- **Initialization**: The initial state `dp[offset] = 1` is correct as it represents the starting point with a prefix sum of `0`.
- **Transition**: The transition logic correctly updates the possible prefix sums by considering the addition or subtraction of `1`.
- **Final Check**: The final result is taken from `dp[final_sum]`, which is the count of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sums.

### Considerations
- **Modulo Operation**: The program correctly applies the modulo operation to handle large numbers.
- **Input Parsing**: The input parsing in `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case accordingly.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem using dynamic programming. It handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
