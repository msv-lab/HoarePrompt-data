To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop for each test case. The loop reads two integers `n` and `k` for each test case, and then prints `n` if `n - k <= 1`; otherwise, it prints `1`.

The initial state provides the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)`. After processing all test cases, the output will be a series of numbers printed by the loop, one for each test case.

Since the loop does not modify any variables outside its scope and the input is read fresh for each iteration, the state of variables `n` and `k` after the loop will be the values from the last test case that was processed. However, the primary output of interest is the series of printed values.

Let's break down the output for each test case:
- If `n - k <= 1`, the output for that test case is `n`.
- If `n - k > 1`, the output for that test case is `1`.

After all iterations, the output state will be a sequence of numbers, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Thus, the output state can be described as a series of printed values based on the conditions specified for each test case.

Output State: **a series of numbers where each number is either `n` or `1` depending on the condition `n - k <= 1` for each test case.**
