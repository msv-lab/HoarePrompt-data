You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    1

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}. There are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: a series of numbers where each number is either `n` or `1` depending on the condition `n - k <= 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints `1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are `n` islands, initially fully connected by bridges.
- Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
- Everule starts on island 1 and can visit islands connected by bridges.
- Goal: For each test case, determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Logic of the Program:
- For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
- It then checks if `n - k <= 1`:
  - If true, it prints `n` (Everule can still visit all islands).
  - If false, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).

### Edge Cases and Verification:
1. **Case 1: No bridges destroyed (`k = 0`)**:
   - All islands are reachable, so the answer should be `n`.
   - The program correctly returns `n` when `k = 0`.

2. **Case 2: `k` is large enough to disconnect all islands except 1 (`k >= n-1`)**:
   - Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1, so the answer should be `1`.
   - The program correctly returns `1` when `k >= n-1`.

3. **Case 3: `k` is less than `n-1` but more than `0`**:
   - Dominater can only destroy some bridges, but not enough to isolate island 1 completely.
   - The program incorrectly returns `1` in this case, which is not always true. Everule might still be able to visit more than one island.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 2`:
- Initially, there are 6 bridges (1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4).
- Dominater can destroy 2 bridges. The optimal strategy might be to destroy bridges 2-3 and 2-4, leaving Everule able to visit islands 1, 2, and possibly 3 or 4 depending on the remaining connections.
- The program would output `1`, which is incorrect because Everule can still visit more than one island.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when `0 < k < n-1`, as it incorrectly assumes that Everule can only visit island 1 in such cases.

Correctness: **False**.
