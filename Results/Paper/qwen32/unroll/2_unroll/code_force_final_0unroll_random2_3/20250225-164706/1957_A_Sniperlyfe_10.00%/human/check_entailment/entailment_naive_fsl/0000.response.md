Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of groups of 4 sticks of the same length, as it assumes that the only regular polygon that can be formed is a square. However, the problem statement specifies that we need to find the maximum number of regular polygons (equal-sided) of any type, not just squares.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
We can form two equilateral triangles (regular polygons with 3 sides) using the given sticks.

However, the provided program will output `1` because it only considers forming squares (groups of 4 sticks of the same length):

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))
```

This program does not account for the possibility of forming regular polygons with fewer than 4 sides, such as triangles (3 sides) or pentagons (5 sides).

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible regular polygons, only squares.
