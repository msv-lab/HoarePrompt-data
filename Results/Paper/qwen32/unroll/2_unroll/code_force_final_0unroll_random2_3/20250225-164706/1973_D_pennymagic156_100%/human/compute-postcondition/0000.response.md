The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_3()` to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of a hidden array, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will be updated with the values returned by `func_3()`. Since the specific values returned by `func_3()` are not provided, we can only state that `n` and `k` will be updated accordingly, and `k` will still satisfy the condition 1 <= k <= n.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `k` satisfies 1 <= `k` <= `n`.**
