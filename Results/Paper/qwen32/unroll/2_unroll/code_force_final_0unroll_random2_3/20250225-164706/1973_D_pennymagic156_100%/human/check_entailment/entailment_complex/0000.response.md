### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray satisfies `f(l, r) = m`.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a[l:r+1])`
   - Cat can ask at most `2n` questions.
   - The array `a` is hidden, and Fox responds to queries about `f(l, r)`.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.

2. **Initial Query Loop**:
   - The program iterates from `i = n` down to `1` and makes queries of the form `? 1 (i * n)`.
   - It expects `func_2()` to return the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
   - If `r = n`, it means the maximum value in the array is `i`, and it breaks the loop setting `v = i`.

3. **Main Query Loop**:
   - For each `i` from `1` to `n // k`, it initializes `cnt` to `k` (number of subarrays) and `l` to `1`.
   - It makes queries of the form `? l (i * v)` and expects `func_2()` to return the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - It updates `l` to `r + 1` and decrements `cnt`.
   - If `cnt == 0` and `l == n + 1`, it means it successfully split the array into `k` subarrays each with `f(l, r) = i * v`, and it outputs `! i * v`.

4. **Failure Case**:
   - If no such `i` is found, it outputs `! -1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:

- The program tries to find the largest possible `m` by starting from the highest possible value and working downwards.
- It checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays each with `f(l, r) = m` by making queries and checking the responses.
- The program ensures that the queries do not exceed `2n` by limiting the number of iterations and queries per iteration.

The logic seems sound, and the program follows the problem's requirements. It efficiently narrows down the possible values of `m` by leveraging the interaction with Fox's responses.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
