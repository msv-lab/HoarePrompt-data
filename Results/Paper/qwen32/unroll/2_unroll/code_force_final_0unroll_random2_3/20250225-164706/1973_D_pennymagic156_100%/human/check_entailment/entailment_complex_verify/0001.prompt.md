You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Fox gave Cat two positive integers n and k . She has a hidden array a_1,
\ldots , a_n of length n , such that 1 \leq a_i \leq n for every i . Now they
are going to play the following game:

For any two integers l, r such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n , define f(l, r) =
(r - l + 1) \cdot \max\limits_{x=l}^r a_x . In other words, f(l, r) is equal
to the maximum of the subarray a_l, \ldots, a_r multiplied by its size.

Cat can ask Fox at most 2 n questions about the array. He will tell her two
integers l and x (1 \leq l \leq n, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ), and she will tell him
one integer p as the answer — the smallest positive integer r such that f(l,
r) = x , or n+1 if no such r exists.

Now, Cat needs to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence
c_1, \ldots, c_{k-1} such that 1 \leq c_1 < \ldots < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1)
= f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = \ldots = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m . If no such m exists, he
should indicate this and take -1 as the answer. Note that for k = 1 , m is
always equal to f(1, n) .

In other words, the goal is to find the largest m such that you can split the
array into exactly k subarrays (k is the constant given to you in the
beginning of the interaction) so that all the subarrays have the product of
their length and their maximum equal to m , or determine that no such m
exists. Every element should belong in exactly one of the subarrays.

Cat doesn't know what he should do, so he asked you to play the game for him.

Interaction

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1
\leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 ) — the length of the hidden array and the number of
subarrays in the desired split.

Now you are allowed to make queries in the following way — print one line of
the form "\mathtt{?} \ l \ x " (it must hold that 1 \leq l \leq n , 1 \leq x
\leq 10^9 ) and you will receive the smallest integer r such that l \leq r
\leq n and f(l, r) = x , or n + 1 if no such r exists.

If you want to print the answer, output "\mathtt{!} \ m " and you will recieve
1 if your answer is correct and -1 otherwise. In the first case, the
interaction continues with the next test case. Note that printing the answer
doesn't count towards the number of queries made. Please note that you don't
receive the values for the next test case immediately, you will first have to
read whether your answer to the last test case was correct.

If you receive the integer -1 at any moment, it means your program has made an
invalid query, exceeded the query limit, or gave an incorrect answer. Your
program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the
output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the total sum of n over the test cases won't exceed 10^4
.

Hacks

The format of the hacks should be the following: the first line should contain
one integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases should follow.

The first line of each test case should contain two integers n and k (1 \leq k
\leq n \leq 10^4 ) — the length of the array a and the number of subarrays you
want to split it into.

The second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \leq a_i
\leq n ).

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

    ! 6

Note

The hidden arrays in the three testcases are [1] , [1, 2] and [1, 3, 6, 1, 2,
1] . In the second testcase, no split satisfies the constraints, so the answer
is -1 .

The answer for the first query of the third testcase is 7 since no valid r
exists. For the second query of the third testcase, since 2 \cdot \max(1, 3) =
6 , we will get 2 as the answer, since r = 1 doesn't satisfy the constraint.

The sample interaction guessed all three answers (1, -1 and 6 ) correctly, so
it received 1 after each answer.

If no such value is found after a series of queries, it outputs `! -1`. The function does not return any value (None).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step according to the problem requirements and the program logic.

### Problem Analysis

The objective is to find the largest possible value \( m \) such that the array can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's value \( f(l, r) \) is equal to \( m \). Here, \( f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) \cdot \max(a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r) \).

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by defining several input functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`), but only uses `func_3` and `func_2` in `func_5`.
   - `func_3` reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - `func_2` reads the integer response from Fox after a query.

2. **Finding the Largest Possible \( m \):**
   - The program first tries to find the largest possible value of \( m \) by iterating from the largest possible value down to 1.
   - It queries \( f(1, i \cdot n) \) for each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1.
   - If the response \( v \) is \( n \), it means that the entire array satisfies \( f(1, n) = i \cdot n \), and thus \( v \) is set to \( i \).
   - The loop breaks as soon as such \( i \) is found.

3. **Checking for Valid Split:**
   - After finding the potential \( m \), the program attempts to split the array into \( k \) subarrays each with value \( i \cdot v \).
   - It iterates over possible subarrays, querying \( f(l, i \cdot v) \) for each subarray starting at \( l \).
   - If it successfully finds \( k \) subarrays that satisfy the condition, it prints \( ! \ i \cdot v \) and terminates.
   - If it fails to do so, it prints \( ! \ -1 \).

### Issues and Limitations

1. **Finding the Largest \( m \):**
   - The program assumes that the largest \( m \) can be found by checking \( f(1, i \cdot n) \) for \( i \) from \( n \) to 1. However, this is not guaranteed to find the correct largest \( m \) because \( m \) does not necessarily have to be a multiple of \( n \).

2. **Checking Valid Splits:**
   - The program only checks splits starting from the beginning of the array. It does not consider other possible starting points for subarrays, which could lead to missing valid splits.

3. **Query Efficiency:**
   - The program does not efficiently narrow down the possible values of \( m \). It could use a binary search approach to find the largest \( m \) more efficiently.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the approach to finding the largest \( m \) and checking for valid splits, the program does not guarantee finding the correct answer for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
