To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that appear in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the range parameters.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The range function `range(n, 0, -1)` starts at `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). 

From the problem statement, we know:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `k` satisfies `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is 1.

However, `v` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. We only need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

Since the loop starts with `i` initialized to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` is not something we need to adjust directly because it is set by the `range` function.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` satisfies 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `v` is 1**
