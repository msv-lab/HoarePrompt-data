Let's analyze the problem, the provided code, and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is correct or incorrect.

### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis
The provided code is as follows:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)
```

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `T` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are read from the input.
- `suma` is initialized to 0.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b`.
- `x` is calculated as \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
- If \(a - i(i - 1) > 0\), `x` is added to `suma`.
- Finally, `suma - 1` is printed.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b`, which is incorrect. It should iterate over both `a` and `b`.
- The calculation of `x` and the condition do not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Loop Structure**:
   - The code iterates over `i` from 1 to `b`. This is not the correct approach. We need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition in the problem is \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This is not checked in the provided code. Instead, the code calculates `x` based on a formula that does not relate to the problem's condition.

3. **Calculation of `x`**:
   - The formula used to calculate `x` (\(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\)) is not related to the problem's requirement. This formula does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 2, m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). The provided code will not correctly identify these pairs.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given condition. The loop structure and the calculation of `x` are incorrect.

**Final: False**
