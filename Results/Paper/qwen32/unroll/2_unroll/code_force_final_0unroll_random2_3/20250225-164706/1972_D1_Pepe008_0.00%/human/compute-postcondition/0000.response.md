Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^6, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the input, which is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.
