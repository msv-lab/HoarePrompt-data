To determine the output state after the execution of the given code snippet, we need to consider the impact of the function call `moves = func_1(nodes, start)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined within the provided context, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. However, we can assume that `func_1` returns a value that gets assigned to `moves`. 

Given the initial state and the fact that only `moves` is being assigned a value from `func_1`, the other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `leaves`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within `func_1`.

Thus, the output state will include the new value of `moves` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighboring nodes, `start` is the integer value provided by the user input such that `1 <= start <= n`, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes from the `nodes` dictionary, `moves` is the return value of `func_1(nodes, start)`**.
