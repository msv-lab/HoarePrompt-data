nodes is a list of lists where each sublist contains the neighbors of a node in the tree, start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and parent is an optional parameter used in the DFS traversal to keep track of the parent node, initially set to None. The tree has n nodes (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and is represented by n-1 edges provided in the input. The start node is one of the nodes in the tree (1 ≤ start ≤ n).
