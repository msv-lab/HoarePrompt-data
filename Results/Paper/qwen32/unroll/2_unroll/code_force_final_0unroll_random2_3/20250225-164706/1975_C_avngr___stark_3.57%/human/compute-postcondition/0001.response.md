The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not going to be used inside the loop. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `t` is the only thing we can adjust according to the loop head. The other variables (`n`, `a`, etc.) are defined inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop starts executing.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1**
