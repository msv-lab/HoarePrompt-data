Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the maximum possible value that the array can be reduced to by repeatedly setting subarrays to their median.

The current implementation only considers the minimum of each pair of adjacent elements and does not account for the median of larger subarrays. Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
1 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- The median of the entire array `[1, 3, 2]` is `2` (after sorting it becomes `[1, 2, 3]`).
- However, if we consider subarrays:
  - Subarray `[1, 3]` has a median of `2`.
  - Subarray `[3, 2]` has a median of `2`.
  - Subarray `[1, 3, 2]` has a median of `2`.
- The maximum possible value that the array can be reduced to is `3` by choosing the subarray `[3]` or `[3, 2]` or `[1, 3, 2]`.

Actual Output from the Program:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The program only considers the minimum of adjacent pairs, which in this case is `min(1, 3) = 1` and `min(3, 2) = 2`. It then incorrectly returns `2`, which is not the maximum possible value.

The program needs to consider the median of all possible subarrays to find the maximum possible value that the array can be reduced to.
