You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: For each test case, the maximum value of the minimum of consecutive elements in the array `a` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum value of the minimum of consecutive elements in the array.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the maximum possible value that the array can be reduced to by repeatedly setting subarrays to their median.

The current implementation only considers the minimum of each pair of adjacent elements and does not account for the median of larger subarrays. Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
1 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- The median of the entire array `[1, 3, 2]` is `2` (after sorting it becomes `[1, 2, 3]`).
- However, if we consider subarrays:
  - Subarray `[1, 3]` has a median of `2`.
  - Subarray `[3, 2]` has a median of `2`.
  - Subarray `[1, 3, 2]` has a median of `2`.
- The maximum possible value that the array can be reduced to is `3` by choosing the subarray `[3]` or `[3, 2]` or `[1, 3, 2]`.

Actual Output from the Program:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The program only considers the minimum of adjacent pairs, which in this case is `min(1, 3) = 1` and `min(3, 2) = 2`. It then incorrectly returns `2`, which is not the maximum possible value.

The program needs to consider the median of all possible subarrays to find the maximum possible value that the array can be reduced to.
