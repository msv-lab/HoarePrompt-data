For the given task, we need to ensure that the `while t:` loop can execute at least once. The loop will execute if the condition `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. 

Given that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases with the constraint `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `t` should already be a positive integer and thus truthy. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop executes at least once under the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); the other variables (`n`, `x_2`, `x_3`, ..., `x_n`) remain unchanged.**

Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the range [1, 10^4], it will always be truthy, and the loop will execute at least once.
