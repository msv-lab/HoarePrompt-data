### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a coin game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. The provided program correctly implements this logic in the `func_1` function. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input and splits it into test cases. For each test case, it extracts the number of coins (`n`) and the string representing the state of the coins (`s`).

2. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**: The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.

3. **Determining the Winner**: The function then checks if the count of 'U' characters is odd or even:
   - If the count is odd, Alice wins, so the function returns 'YES'.
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, so the function returns 'NO'.

4. **Optimal Play**: The problem statement guarantees that both players play optimally. The key insight here is that the parity of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner. This is because:
   - Each move removes one facing-up coin and may flip two adjacent coins, but the parity of the number of facing-up coins remains the same after each move.
   - Therefore, if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of facing-up coins is even, and vice versa.

5. **Execution Summary**: The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic of checking the parity of the number of 'U' characters and returning 'YES' or 'NO' based on that parity.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
