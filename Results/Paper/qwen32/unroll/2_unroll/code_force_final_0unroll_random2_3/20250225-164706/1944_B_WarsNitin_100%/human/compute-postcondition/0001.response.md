The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `q` and the range it iterates over is `t`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `q` and the value of `t`.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The variable `q` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. The initial state of `q` does not need to be adjusted because it is set by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000**, `q` is 0**
