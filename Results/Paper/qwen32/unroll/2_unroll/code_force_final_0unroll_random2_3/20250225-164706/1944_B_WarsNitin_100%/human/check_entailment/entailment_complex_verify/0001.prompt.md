You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it outputs two arrays of integers based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the array `a`. The output arrays are constructed such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in each of the two output arrays, and the construction respects the constraints defined by `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, given an integer `n` and `k`.
   - An array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.
   
2. **Output:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k`.
   - `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
   - The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two parts: `b` (first `n` elements) and `c` (last `n` elements).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `b` and `c` are sorted.

4. **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct `l` and `r` by considering pairs of identical elements.
   - It tries to ensure that `l` and `r` each have `2k` elements.
   - It starts by adding unique elements that appear only once in `b` (if any) to a temporary list `l`.
   - It then adds pairs of identical elements from `b` to `ans1` and pairs of identical elements from `c` to `ans2`.
   - Finally, it adds elements from `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2` until both have `2k` elements.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed arrays `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **XOR Condition:**
   - The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of `ans2`.
   - The construction of `l` and the final addition of elements from `l` to `ans1` and `ans2` do not guarantee this condition.

2. **Handling of Unique Elements:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that there will be unique elements in `b` and `c` that are not part of pairs.
   - This assumption is not always valid, especially when all elements in `b` and `c` are part of pairs.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The program's approach does not guarantee that the final `ans1` and `ans2` will satisfy the XOR condition.
   - A more systematic approach is needed to ensure that the XOR of `ans1` equals the XOR of `ans2`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of `r`.

**Correctness: False**
