The code snippet assigns the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `k` have specific values, but the code does not modify these variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and `s` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`.**
