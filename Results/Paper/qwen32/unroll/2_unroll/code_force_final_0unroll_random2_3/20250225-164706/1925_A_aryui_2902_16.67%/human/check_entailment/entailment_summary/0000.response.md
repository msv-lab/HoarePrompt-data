Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires constructing a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`. The program simply repeats the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times, which does not guarantee that all subsequences of length `n` will be present.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The program would output `abcabc`, but this string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the characters `a`, `b`, and `c` (such as `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, and `cc`).

To correctly solve the problem, a De Bruijn sequence for the given `n` and `k` should be generated. A De Bruijn sequence for a given alphabet size `k` and length `n` is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears exactly once as a substring.

Given the problem's constraints, the provided program does not meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
