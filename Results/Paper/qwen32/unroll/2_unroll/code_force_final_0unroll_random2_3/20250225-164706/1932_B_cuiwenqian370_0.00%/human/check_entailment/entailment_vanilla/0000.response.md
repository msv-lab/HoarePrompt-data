Reasoning:
The provided program does not solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided code is not related to this problem. Instead, it seems to be solving a different problem, possibly related to a sequence of '@' and '*' characters and finding the maximum number of '@' characters that can be achieved under certain conditions.

Let's break down the provided code:

1. `func_1(path)`: This function seems to process a string `path` where '@' and '*' characters are used. The function calculates some dynamic programming values based on these characters to find the maximum number of '@' characters that can be achieved, but this is not relevant to the problem at hand.

2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` with each test case. It then prints the results. However, the test cases are not being processed correctly for the given problem because `func_1` is not designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur.

The correct approach to solve the given problem is to iterate through each sign, starting from year 0, and find the next occurrence of each sign based on its periodicity, while ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(n, periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current_year
        current_year = ((current_year + period - 1) // period) * period
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads the input, processes each test case to find the year when the n-th sign will occur, and prints the results.

Correctness: **False**
