The only variable in the loop head is `q`, and it iterates over the range of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already given as an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, it is already ensured that the loop can execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` or `q` itself. However, we need to ensure that the state is correctly described in terms of the loop's execution context.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `q` is 0 at the start of the loop**

This state ensures that the loop will execute at least once since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 32, inclusive.
