Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting of only the characters 'A' and 'B'.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The precondition about the test cases and the strings remains unchanged.
