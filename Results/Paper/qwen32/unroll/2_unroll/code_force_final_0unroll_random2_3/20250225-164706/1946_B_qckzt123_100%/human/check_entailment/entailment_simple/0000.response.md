### Reasoning:

The problem asks us to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to determine the maximum possible sum after `k` such operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Insights:
1. **Maximizing Subarray Sum:** The maximum subarray sum (using Kadane's algorithm) helps determine the best subarray to duplicate and insert. This is because inserting a positive sum will increase the total sum of the array.
2. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum:** After inserting the maximum subarray sum once, the next best operation is to insert the doubled sum of the same subarray, and so on. This is because the sum of the array grows exponentially with each operation.
3. **Modulo Operation:** Since the sum can get very large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within standard integer limits.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a` itself.
- **Computing Total Sum (`s`):** The program calculates the total sum of the array `a`.
- **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`):** The program uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in `a`.
- **Calculating Initial Answer (`ans`):** The initial answer is the sum of the total array sum `s` and the maximum subarray sum `t`, taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum:** The program then doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for `k-1` operations, updating the answer each time and taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result remains within bounds.

The program correctly implements the above logic. It handles the constraints efficiently, and the use of modulo ensures that the result does not overflow.
