Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one based on the operations specified, which is not detailed here.**
