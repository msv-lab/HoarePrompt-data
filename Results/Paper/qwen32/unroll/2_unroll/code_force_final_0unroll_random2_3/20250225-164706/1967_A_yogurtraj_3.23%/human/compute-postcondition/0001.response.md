To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand the logic of the provided code snippet. The code processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers `a` and two integers `n` and `k`. The goal is to determine the final value of `r` and use it to compute a specific output based on the remaining `k`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, `n` and `k` are read, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Processing Differences**:
   - The variable `r` is initialized to the first element of the sorted list `a`.
   - The variable `rem` is initialized to 0, and `y` is initialized to 0.
   - The code iterates through the sorted list and checks if the remaining `k` can cover the cost of making all elements up to the current position equal to the next element.
   - If `k` is insufficient to cover the cost, `r` is set to the maximum possible value it can reach with the remaining `k`, and `rem` and `y` are calculated accordingly.
   - If `k` is sufficient, it is reduced by the cost, and `r` is updated to the next element.
4. **Final Calculation**:
   - If `k` is not zero after the loop, it means there is still some `k` left to distribute, and `r` is adjusted accordingly.
   - The final output is calculated based on the final value of `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the final output state after all iterations will be determined by the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` after processing all test cases.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state variables (`r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k`) are reinitialized for each test case, the final output state will be the result of the last test case processed.

Output State: **the final output calculated based on the last test case processed, which is printed in the format specified in the code.**
