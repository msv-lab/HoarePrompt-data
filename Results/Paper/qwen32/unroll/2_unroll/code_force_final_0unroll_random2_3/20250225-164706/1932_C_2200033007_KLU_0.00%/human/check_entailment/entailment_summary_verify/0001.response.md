### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly implements the problem's requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input:**
   - An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Two integers `n` and `m`.
     - An array `a` of length `n`.
     - A string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.
   
2. **Processing:**
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` modulo `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from `a`.
     - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `n` integers representing the remainders after each command.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input correctly and uses a function `func_1` to process each test case. Let's break down the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

- **Step 1:** The function constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element; if 'R', it appends the rightmost element.
- **Step 2:** It then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and stores these products in `ans`.
- **Step 3:** Finally, it returns the reversed `ans` list.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Collection of Elements:**
   - The program collects only the elements that are about to be removed, not the product of all current elements in the array `a` at each step.
   - This is incorrect because the problem requires the product of all elements in the current array, not just the element being removed.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The product should be calculated from the full array `a` at each step, and it should be updated based on the command ('L' or 'R').
   - The current implementation incorrectly calculates the product of the elements in `b`, which only contains the elements that are about to be removed.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Maintain a Running Product:** Instead of collecting elements that are about to be removed, maintain a running product of the array `a`.
- **Update Product Based on Command:** When a command is 'L', update the product by removing the leftmost element and when it's 'R', remove the rightmost element.
- **Output the Remainder:** Output the remainder of the current product after each command.

#### Correct Implementation Example:
```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    ans = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    for command in s:
        ans.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[left], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
            left += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[right], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
            right -= 1
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It incorrectly collects elements instead of maintaining a running product and updating it based on the commands.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
