You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by each character in `s`. It then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these products in their original order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands in the string `s` and output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` before removing the leftmost or rightmost element as per the command.
2. The current implementation of `func_1` first collects elements to be removed in the list `b` based on the commands, then calculates the product of these elements in reverse order and outputs the remainders. This approach is incorrect because it does not compute the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step before removing an element.

Here's a specific example that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0 3 12 24
```

Explanation of the issue:
- The program calculates the product of the elements in the order they are removed and then takes the remainder, which is incorrect.
- For the first command 'L', the product of the current array `[3, 1, 4, 2]` is `24`, and `24 % 6 = 0`.
- For the second command 'R', the product of the current array `[1, 4, 2]` is `8`, and `8 % 6 = 2`.
- For the third command 'R', the product of the current array `[1, 4]` is `4`, and `4 % 6 = 4`.
- For the fourth command 'L', the product of the current array `[4]` is `4`, and `4 % 6 = 4`. However, the last command should result in `1 % 6 = 1` after removing the last remaining element.

The program does not correctly compute the product of the current state of the array `a` before removing an element as per the command. Therefore, it is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should compute the product of the current array `a` before removing an element in each iteration and store the remainders accordingly.
