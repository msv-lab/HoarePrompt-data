### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on the following steps:

1. **Extract Unique Elements:** It creates sets of unique elements from both arrays `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. This is done to focus only on the relevant numbers that could be part of the solution.
   
2. **Categorize Elements:**
   - `only_a`: Elements that are in `a` but not in `b` and are ≤ k.
   - `only_b`: Elements that are in `b` but not in `a` and are ≤ k.
   - `both`: Elements that are in both `a` and `b` and are ≤ k.

3. **Check Conditions:**
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k/2`, it's impossible to choose `k/2` elements from `b` and still have all numbers from 1 to `k`.
   - If the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k/2`, it's impossible to choose `k/2` elements from `a` and still have all numbers from 1 to `k`.
   - If the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`, it's impossible to have all numbers from 1 to `k`.

4. **Determine Result:** If none of the above conditions are violated, the result is 'YES'; otherwise, it's 'NO'.

### Analysis:

The program correctly implements the logic to check if it's possible to choose `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included in the chosen elements. It considers the unique elements that are relevant (≤ k) and categorizes them appropriately. The conditions checked ensure that the constraints are met.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic aligns with the problem requirements, and it handles the constraints efficiently. Thus, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
