t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, m, and k, followed by two lists a and b. n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5. k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m). a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_j <= 10^6. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.
