You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and prints the minimum cost required to buy `k` tickets over `n` sale days, given that up to `m` tickets can be purchased each day and each day has a specific price per ticket.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days with the goal of minimizing the total cost.
2. Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
3. Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Provided Program:
The program sorts the list of ticket prices and then iterates through the sorted list, purchasing tickets each day until `k` tickets are bought. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sort the Prices**: The ticket prices are sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which is a greedy approach to minimize cost.
2. **Iterate and Purchase**: For each day, the program calculates the number of tickets it can buy (`s`), which is the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets allowed per day) and `k` (remaining tickets needed). It then:
   - Adds the cost of these tickets to the total cost (`c`).
   - Increases the price increment (`t`) by the number of tickets bought (`s`).
   - Decreases the remaining tickets needed (`k`) by the number of tickets bought (`s`).
3. **Output the Total Cost**: After all tickets are bought, the program prints the total cost.

### Analysis:
- **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy strategy by sorting the ticket prices and buying the cheapest tickets first. This is generally a good approach for this type of problem because it ensures that we are always spending the least amount of money first.
- **Price Increment**: The program correctly implements the price increment mechanism. After buying `s` tickets on a given day, it increases the price for all subsequent days by `s`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where `k` is less than `m` (i.e., we can buy all remaining tickets in one day) and cases where `k` is greater than `m` (i.e., we need to buy tickets over multiple days).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the problem requirements and efficiently finds the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets. The greedy approach combined with the price increment mechanism ensures that the solution is optimal.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
