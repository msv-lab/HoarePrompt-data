You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns according to the promotion rules.

Here is the given program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), then it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The formula used in the program: `a * n` is correct.

2. **Case 2: \( b > a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is greater than the usual price \( a \), then we need to determine the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price.
   - The formula used in the program: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` is intended to calculate the maximum profit.
   - The value of \( k \) is set to `min(n, b - a)`, which means we can sell up to \( b - a \) buns at the modified price, but not more than \( n \) buns in total.

### Checking Edge Cases

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - Example: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)
     - Since \( b > a \), the code should use the formula for \( b > a \).
     - Correct output: 17 (as per the problem description).
   - Example: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 3 \)
     - Since \( b \leq a \), the code should use `a * n`.
     - Correct output: 16 (4 * 4).

2. **Case 2: \( b > a \)**
   - Example: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)
     - The optimal \( k \) is `min(5, 9 - 5) = min(5, 4) = 4`.
     - Correct output: 35 (as per the problem description).
   - Example: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)
     - Since \( b \leq a \), the code should use `a * n`.
     - Correct output: 100 (10 * 10).

3. **Edge Case: Large Values**
   - Example: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000 \)
     - Since \( b = a \), the code should use `a * n`.
     - Correct output: \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 \).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to handle all the cases correctly as per the problem description. The logic and formulas used are appropriate for both scenarios (\( b \leq a \) and \( b > a \)).

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation

The program correctly handles the cases where the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \) by selling all buns at the usual price. When \( b > a \), the program calculates the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price and computes the profit accordingly. The program also handles large values correctly without any issues.
