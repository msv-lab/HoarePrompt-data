Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation sorts the array and then counts the occurrences of the median element, but it does not determine how many increments are needed to increase the median.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median element.
3. Determine the minimum number of increments needed to make at least half of the elements greater than the current median.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1  # Index of the median in 0-based index
        current_median = a[p]
        operations = 0
        
        # We need to make at least half of the elements greater than the current median
        target_count = (n + 1) // 2
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > current_median:
                count += 1
            if count >= target_count:
                break
            operations += current_median + 1 - a[i]
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
