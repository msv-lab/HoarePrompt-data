Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation sorts the array and counts the occurrences of the median element, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

To find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify the current median**: Sort the array and find the median element.
2. **Find the next possible median**: Determine the smallest element that is greater than the current median.
3. **Calculate the number of operations**: Determine how many elements need to be incremented to reach the next possible median.

Let's consider an example to illustrate why the current code is incorrect:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The current median of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `3`.
- To increase the median, we need to make the new median at least `4`.
- We can achieve this by incrementing the elements `1`, `2`, and `3` to `4`, which requires `3` operations.
- The current code, however, would output `1` because it counts the occurrences of the current median `3`, which is incorrect.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        
        # Find the smallest element greater than the current median
        next_median = float('inf')
        for num in a:
            if num > current_median:
                next_median = num
                break
        
        # If no element is greater than the current median, we need to increment the current median elements
        if next_median == float('inf'):
            next_median = current_median + 1
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed to make the current median elements at least next_median
        operations = 0
        for i in range(p + 1):
            if a[i] < next_median:
                operations += next_median - a[i]
        
        print(operations)

```

This corrected version correctly identifies the current median, finds the next possible median, and calculates the minimum number of operations required to achieve it.
