You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        
        if el == '>':
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        
    #State: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', pre is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in s1, totalOne is 0, preOne is [0], suffZero is a list containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters, ans is a list of n values updated with the calculated differences.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is a list of n values calculated based on the cumulative sums of '>' and '<' characters in the string s1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s1`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function returns the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
