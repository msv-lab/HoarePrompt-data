The function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index determined by `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. This effectively computes the difference between the last time point and a time point that is `times` positions before the last, with a safeguard to ensure the index does not go out of bounds.
