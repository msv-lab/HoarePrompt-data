### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position, given the rules of movement and inversion of characters. The solution is divided into two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's analyze the correctness of each function in the context of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Compute the difference between the last element in `arr` and an element `times` positions before the last, ensuring the index is within bounds.
- **Execution Summary**: This function effectively calculates the difference between two specific positions in the list `arr` based on the given `times` parameter. It ensures that the index does not go out of bounds by using `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
- **Correctness**: This function seems to be correctly implemented for its intended purpose of computing differences based on the provided index logic.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
- **Execution Summary**:
  - **Preprocessing**:
    - `pre`: List of indices where the character is `>`.
    - `totalOne`: Total number of `>` characters.
    - `preOne`: Cumulative sum of indices of `>` characters.
    - `suffZero`: Cumulative sum of indices of `<` characters, starting from the end.
    - `ans`: List to store the results for each starting position.
  - **Main Loop**:
    - Iterates over the string from the end to the beginning.
    - For each character, depending on whether it is `>` or `<`, it calculates the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and the `func_1` function.
    - Adjusts the cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) based on the character type.
  - **Output**: Prints the results for each starting position.

#### Analysis:
- The function `func_2` appears to be correctly processing the grid and calculating the number of steps for each starting position based on the given rules. The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function to compute differences seems to be aligned with the problem's requirements.
- The logic for handling both `>` and `<` characters and updating the cumulative sums is consistent with the movement and inversion rules described in the problem statement.
- The final output list `ans` is correctly constructed and printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided execution summaries and the analysis of the functions, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
