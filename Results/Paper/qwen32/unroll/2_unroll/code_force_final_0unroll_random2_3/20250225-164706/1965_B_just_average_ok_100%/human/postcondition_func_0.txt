The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list of numbers based on the value of `k`, modifies this list by adding and removing specific elements, and then outputs the length of the modified list followed by its elements. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution.
