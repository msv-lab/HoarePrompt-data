Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly converts 24-hour format times to 12-hour format times.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is not necessary since the day part is determined during each iteration based on the hour value.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string `s` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

3. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If the hour `h` is `0` (midnight), it sets `h` to `12` and `day` to `'AM'`. This is correct because midnight is represented as `12:00 AM` in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `12` (PM times), it subtracts `12` from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`. This is correct because PM times in 24-hour format are `13` to `23`, which should be `01` to `11` in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour `h` is `12` (noon), it sets `day` to `'PM'`. This is correct because noon is represented as `12:00 PM` in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `11` (AM times), it sets `day` to `'AM'`. This is correct because these times are the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` with leading zeros for hours and minutes.

### Issues:
- The initialization of `day` to `'AM'` at the beginning of the function is redundant since `day` is reassigned in each iteration.
- The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as midnight (`00:00`), noon (`12:00`), and times in the AM and PM ranges.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the problem description. The output format matches the requirements, and all edge cases are handled properly.

Correctness: **True**
