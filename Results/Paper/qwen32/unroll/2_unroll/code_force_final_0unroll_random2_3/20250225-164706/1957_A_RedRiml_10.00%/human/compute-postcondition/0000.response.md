`w` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer.**
