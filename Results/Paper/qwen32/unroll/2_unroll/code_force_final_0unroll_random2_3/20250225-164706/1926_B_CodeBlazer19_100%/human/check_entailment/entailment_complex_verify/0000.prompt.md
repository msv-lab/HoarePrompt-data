You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid. This is followed by n lines, each containing n characters which are either '0' or '1'. The grid in each test case contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:

            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` printed lines, each being either 'TRIANGLE', 'SQUARE', or an empty string, depending on the input strings for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an `n` by `n` grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, with the size of the shape greater than 1. The function outputs 'TRIANGLE' if a triangle is detected and 'SQUARE' if a square is detected for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle and Square Detection**:
   - The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. However, a triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of '1's, not just one '1' per row.
   - The program checks if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. However, this check is not sufficient to confirm that the shape is a square, as a triangle can also have multiple '1's in a row.

2. **Lack of Detailed Shape Validation**:
   - The program does not validate the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square. For example, it does not check if the '1's form a centered triangle or a square with equal distances from the left edge.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the triangle is upside down.

3. **Incorrect Output Logic**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if any row has exactly one '1', the shape is a triangle. This is not always true, as a square can also have rows with a single '1' if it is positioned at the edge of the grid.
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
00100
01110
11111
01110
00100
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```
In this case, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because it encounters rows with more than one '1', which could be part of either a square or a triangle. However, the shape in the grid is actually a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and should be revised to properly detect the specific patterns of triangles and squares as described in the problem statement.
