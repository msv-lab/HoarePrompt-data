Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here are the main issues with the code:

1. **Detection of Triangle and Square**:
   - The program incorrectly identifies a triangle if there is any row with exactly one '1'. This is not the correct definition of a triangle as described in the problem statement.
   - The program incorrectly identifies a square if there is any row with more than one '1'. This does not account for the specific pattern of a square as described in the problem statement.

2. **Logic for Triangle**:
   - A triangle must have rows with a specific pattern: the i-th row must have 2*i - 1 '1's, and these '1's must be centered.
   - The program does not check for this pattern and instead only checks if there is a row with exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to determine a triangle.

3. **Logic for Square**:
   - A square must have rows with the same number of '1's, and these '1's must be at the same distance from the left edge.
   - The program does not check for this pattern and instead only checks if there is a row with more than one '1', which is not sufficient to determine a square.

4. **Variable Initialization**:
   - The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and then set to 'TRIANGLE' if a row with exactly one '1' is found. However, `a` is not reset for each test case, and its value is not properly checked.
   - The variable `b` is initialized to an empty string and then set to 'SQUARE' if a row with more than one '1' is found. However, `b` is not reset for each test case, and its value is not properly checked.

### Correct Approach:
The program needs to check the patterns for both triangles and squares as described in the problem statement. It should iterate through the grid and verify the specific patterns for each shape.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    def is_triangle(grid, n):
        # Check for triangle (upside down or right-side up)
        for i in range(n):
            count = grid[i].count('1')
            if count > 0 and count != 2 * i + 1 and count != 2 * (n - i - 1) + 1:
                return False
        return True

    def is_square(grid, n):
        # Check for square
        count = None
        for i in range(n):
            c = grid[i].count('1')
            if c > 0:
                if count is None:
                    count = c
                elif count != c:
                    return False
        return count is not None and count > 1

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_triangle(grid, n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")

func()
```

This corrected program properly checks the patterns for both triangles and squares and outputs the correct result for each test case.
