Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, consisting of '0's and '1's. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's with a size (k) greater than 1. The function returns the size `k` of the triangle or square for each test case.**
