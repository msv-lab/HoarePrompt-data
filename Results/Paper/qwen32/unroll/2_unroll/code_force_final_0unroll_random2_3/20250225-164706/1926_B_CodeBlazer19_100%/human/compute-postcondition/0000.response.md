The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, so after executing this line, `t` will hold the specific integer value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)**.
