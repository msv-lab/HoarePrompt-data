Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid. This is followed by n lines, each containing n characters which are either '0' or '1'. The grid in each test case contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.**
