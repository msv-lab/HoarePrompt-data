### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine whether a given grid contains a triangle or a square based on the count of '1's in each row. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square.

Here are the issues with the provided logic:
1. **Triangle Detection**: The program incorrectly identifies a triangle if any row has exactly one '1'. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle as per the problem description. A triangle has a specific pattern where the i-th row has 2*i-1 '1's centered in a column.
2. **Square Detection**: The program incorrectly identifies a square if any row has more than one '1'. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square as per the problem description. A square has a specific pattern where each of the k rows has k '1's, all aligned to the left edge of the grid.
3. **Output Logic**: The program uses a simple if-else condition to print the result based on the presence of a single '1' or multiple '1's. This does not account for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
