### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program functions and their roles to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`:
- **Purpose**: To compute the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
- **Process**:
  1. The first `d-1` elements of the row are incremented by 1.
  2. For each subsequent element, it is incremented by 1 plus the minimum value of the preceding `d` elements.
  3. The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost for that row.

However, this function does not correctly compute the minimum cost of installing supports for a row under the given constraints. The function should ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and the cost should account for the minimum cost of placing supports in such a way.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- **Purpose**: To compute the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Process**:
  1. Reads input values `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and the grid `rows`.
  2. Computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  3. Computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
  4. Prints the minimum of these sums.

Since `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost for a row, `func_2` will not produce the correct minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness:
The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of installing supports for a row, which is essential for the correct solution to the problem.

**Correctness: False**
