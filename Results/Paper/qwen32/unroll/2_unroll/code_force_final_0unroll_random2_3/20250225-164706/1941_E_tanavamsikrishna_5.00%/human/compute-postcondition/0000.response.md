The code snippet provided reads four integers from the input, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. The previous values of these variables are overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`rows` and `costs`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, and `costs` is a list of integers representing the cost of installing supports for each row.**
