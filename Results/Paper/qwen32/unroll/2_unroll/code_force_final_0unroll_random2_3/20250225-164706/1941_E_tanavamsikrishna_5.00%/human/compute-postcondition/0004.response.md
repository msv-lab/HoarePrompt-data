To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which is the `i` variable and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 by default when the loop starts.
   - `len(costs) - (k - 1)`: This expression determines the number of iterations the loop can perform. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

### Necessary Conditions:
- `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0` must be true for the loop to execute.
- Simplifying the inequality: `len(costs) > k - 1`.
- This means that the length of the `costs` list must be greater than `k - 1`.

### Adjustments:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are input integers and do not directly affect the loop execution condition.
- `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist (row) contains `m` integers.
- `costs` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`. The length of `costs` is equal to the number of rows in `rows`, which is `n`.
- `total_costs` is an empty list and does not affect the loop execution condition.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, the length of `costs` (which is `n`) must be greater than `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than `k - 1`, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist (row) contains `m` integers read from the input, `costs` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is an empty list**.
