You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns, k is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, rows is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains m integers, and costs is a list of integers representing the cost of installing supports for each row.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: n is the first input integer, m is the second input integer, k is the third input integer, d is the fourth input integer, rows is a 2D list of integers where each sublist (row) contains m integers read from the input, costs is a list of integers where each integer is the result of func_1(row, d) for the corresponding row in rows, total_costs is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list, and costs is a list of integers derived from the rows and the value of d)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, and `costs` is a list of integers representing the cost of installing supports for each row. The function returns a value based on the constraints provided, which could involve calculating the minimum cost to install supports within the given maximum distance `d` while considering the number of bridges `k` and the costs for each row.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
