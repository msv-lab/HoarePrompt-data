To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of `bigList` and `smallList` such that both conditions `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` are satisfied.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `len(smallList) > 0`**: This condition requires that `smallList` is not empty. Therefore, `smallList` must contain at least one element.
2. **Condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**: This condition requires that the last element of `bigList` is the same as the last element of `smallList`. Therefore, the last element of `bigList` must match the last element of `smallList`.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
- Ensure `smallList` is not empty by providing it with at least one element.
- Ensure the last element of `bigList` matches the last element of `smallList`.

### Example Adjustment:
Let's assume the last element of `smallList` is `x`. Then `bigList` must also end with `x`.

### Example State:
Let's assume `smallList` has the element `5` as its last element. Therefore, `bigList` must also end with `5`.

### Final State:
State: **`bigList` is a list ending with `5`, `smallList` is a list ending with `5` and containing at least one element**

### Generalized State:
To be more general, we can say:
State: **`bigList` is a list ending with `x`, `smallList` is a list ending with `x` and containing at least one element**

Here, `x` is any integer that represents the last element of both `bigList` and `smallList`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`bigList` is a list ending with `x`, `smallList` is a list ending with `x` and containing at least one element**
