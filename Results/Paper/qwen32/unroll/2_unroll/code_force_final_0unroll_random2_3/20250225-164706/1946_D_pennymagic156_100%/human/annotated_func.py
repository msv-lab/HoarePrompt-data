#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input and returns a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as input, split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2()`.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and is expected to read input from standard input, which consists of multiple lines of integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers converted from the space-separated string of integers read from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a single line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing these integers converted from strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_4():

    #The program returns the user's input as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and returns the resulting string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum value between the count of elements that can be XORed to zero at any bit position and the length of the list `a`, which is left empty after the function's execution.
