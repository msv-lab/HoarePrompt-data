### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem described, where we need to find the maximum number of segments (k) such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to a given number x.

Let's break down the program and analyze its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, and `func_4()` are defined to read input, but only `func_3()` and `func_1()` are used in `func_5()`.
   - `func_3()` reads the first line of each test case (n and x), and `func_1()` reads the second line (the array a).

2. **Main Logic in `func_5()`**:
   - The algorithm iterates over each bit position from the most significant bit (29th bit) to the least significant bit (0th bit).
   - For each bit position, it checks the bits of x and the bits of each element in the array a.
   - It calculates the number of elements that have a 1 in the current bit position and checks if this number is odd or even.
   - Depending on the values of u (the bit of x at the current position) and v (the sum of bits of all elements in a at the current position), it either continues, breaks, or performs operations to segment the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to x.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum number of segments that satisfy the conditions, or -1 if no such segments exist.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- The algorithm uses a bitwise approach to determine the maximum number of segments. It processes each bit position independently and uses the properties of bitwise XOR and OR to segment the array.
- The algorithm correctly handles the constraints provided (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30).
- The logic inside the loop ensures that the segments are formed in a way that respects the conditions given in the problem statement.
- The final return statement ensures that the maximum number of segments is returned, or -1 if no valid segments can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles the input correctly, processes the array using bitwise operations, and returns the correct output based on the problem constraints.

### Your response:
