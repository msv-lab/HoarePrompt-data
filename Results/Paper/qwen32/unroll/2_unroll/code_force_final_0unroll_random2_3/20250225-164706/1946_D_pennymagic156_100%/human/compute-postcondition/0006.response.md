Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is less than 2^30. The function returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`, where `a` is an empty list and `ans` holds the maximum count of elements that can be XORed to zero at any bit position.**
