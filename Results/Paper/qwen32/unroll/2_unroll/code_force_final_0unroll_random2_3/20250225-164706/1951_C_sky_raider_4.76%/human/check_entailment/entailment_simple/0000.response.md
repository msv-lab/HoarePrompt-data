Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the prices and then purchasing tickets in a greedy manner, but it contains logical errors that make it incorrect. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices in ascending order, which is a reasonable first step to minimize costs. However, the subsequent logic for purchasing tickets is flawed.

2. **Calculating the Cost**: The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The cost should start at 0, and the program should accumulate the cost based on the number of tickets purchased each day.

3. **Purchasing Tickets**: The program uses `s = min(m, k)` to determine the number of tickets to buy each day, which is correct. However, the cost calculation `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The term `- s * s / 2` is not part of the correct cost calculation and seems to be an attempt to adjust for the number of tickets bought, but it is not necessary and incorrect in this context.

4. **Updating Prices**: The program does not correctly update the prices for subsequent days after purchasing tickets, which is a key part of the problem's constraints.

5. **Final Output**: The final output is not correctly calculated due to the above issues.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
