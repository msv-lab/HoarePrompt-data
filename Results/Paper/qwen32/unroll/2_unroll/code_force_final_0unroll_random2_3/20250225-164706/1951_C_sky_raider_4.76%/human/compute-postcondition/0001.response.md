To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the given loop and its behavior with the initial state provided.

The loop is structured to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of days `n`, the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day `m`, and the total number of tickets to be bought `k`.
2. Reads the list of prices for each day.
3. Sorts the list of prices in ascending order.
4. Initializes `s` to 0 and `c` to `k * k / 2`.
5. Iterates over each day and updates `s` to be the minimum of `m` and `k`, then decreases `k` by `s`.
6. Updates `c` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day minus the square of `s` divided by 2.
7. Prints the final value of `c` as an integer.

Given the loop's structure, it processes each test case independently and prints the result for each one. Since the loop iterates over a number of test cases (determined by the first input integer), the output state will be the printed results for each test case.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, we need to understand that the state of variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, and `c` will be different for each test case and will not persist across iterations. However, the final output will be the series of printed values of `c` for each test case.

The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the final value of `c` for each test case.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the final value of `c` for each test case.**
