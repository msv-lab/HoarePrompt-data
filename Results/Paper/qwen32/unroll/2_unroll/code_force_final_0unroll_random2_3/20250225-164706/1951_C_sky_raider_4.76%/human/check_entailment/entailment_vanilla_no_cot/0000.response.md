Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect. The current implementation does not account for the price increase mechanism correctly.
2. The variable `c` is initialized incorrectly and used inappropriately.
3. The loop iterates over all days, but it should dynamically decide how many tickets to buy each day based on the current prices and constraints.

Here is a more correct approach:

1. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day.
2. Keep track of the number of tickets bought and the current price increase.
3. Adjust the number of tickets bought each day based on the remaining tickets needed and the maximum allowed per day.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        heap = []
        increase = 0
        total_cost = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            heapq.heappush(heap, price)
        
        while k > 0:
            price = heapq.heappop(heap)
            buy = min(m, k)
            total_cost += buy * (price + increase)
            k -= buy
            increase += buy
            heapq.heappush(heap, price + increase)
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected program uses a min-heap to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the price increases. It ensures that the number of tickets bought each day does not exceed the allowed maximum and keeps track of the total cost correctly.
