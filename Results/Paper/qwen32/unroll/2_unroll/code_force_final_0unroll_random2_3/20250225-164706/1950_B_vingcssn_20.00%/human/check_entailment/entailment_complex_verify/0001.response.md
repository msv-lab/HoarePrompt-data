Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \) by printing the predefined patterns as specified in the problem statement. However, for values of \( n > 4 \), the program outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the appropriate checkerboard pattern. This behavior is inconsistent with the problem statement, which requires the program to handle all values of \( n \) from 1 to 20, inclusive.

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code confirm this behavior. The annotations state that for values of \( n \) greater than 4, the program prints "No esta en el rango," which is not the expected output according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in identifying that the program is incorrect for \( n > 4 \).

Final: **False**
