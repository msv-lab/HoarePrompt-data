Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The given program explicitly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 by printing predefined patterns. However, for n > 4, the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This behavior is incorrect according to the problem statement, which requires the program to handle all values of n between 1 and 20, inclusive.

The program does not dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for values of n greater than 4, which is a requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for n > 4.

Final: **False**
