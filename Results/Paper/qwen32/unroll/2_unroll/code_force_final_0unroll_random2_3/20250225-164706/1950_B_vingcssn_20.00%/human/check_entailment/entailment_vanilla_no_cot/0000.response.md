Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4). It does not generate the checkerboard pattern for any other value of `n` within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The program should be able to generate the pattern for any `n` within the specified range, not just these specific cases. Additionally, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" for `n` values other than 1, 2, 3, and 4, which is not in line with the problem requirements. The program should correctly generate the pattern for all valid inputs.
