To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the behavior of the loop given the initial state and the loop code.

1. The loop iterates `casos` times.
2. In each iteration, a new value of `n` is read from the input.
3. Depending on the value of `n`, a specific pattern is printed:
   - If `n` is 1, the pattern '##\n##' is printed.
   - If `n` is 2, the pattern '##..\n##..\n..##\n..##' is printed.
   - If `n` is 3, the pattern '##..##\n##..##\n..##..\n..##..\n##..##\n##..##' is printed.
   - If `n` is 4, the pattern '##..##..\n##..##..\n..##..##\n..##..##\n##..##..\n##..##..\n..##..##\n..##..##' is printed.
   - If `n` is anything else, the message 'No esta en el rango' is printed.

The variable `t` is not used within the loop, so it remains unchanged. The variable `n` is reassigned in each iteration, but its final value after the loop ends will be the value of `n` from the last iteration.

Let's assume the input values for `n` in each of the `casos` iterations are provided. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `casos` is 3, and the input values for `n` are 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

- **First iteration (c=0):** `n` is 1, so '##\n##' is printed.
- **Second iteration (c=1):** `n` is 2, so '##..\n##..\n..##\n..##' is printed.
- **Third iteration (c=2):** `n` is 3, so '##..##\n##..##\n..##..\n..##..\n##..##\n##..##' is printed.

After these iterations, the final value of `n` will be 3, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **t** is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 20, **n** is 3, **casos** is an input integer.
