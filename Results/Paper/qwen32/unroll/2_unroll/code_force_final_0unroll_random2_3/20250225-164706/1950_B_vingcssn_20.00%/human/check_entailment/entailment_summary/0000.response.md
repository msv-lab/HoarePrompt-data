Reasoning:  
The given Python program is designed to handle the problem statement for specific values of `n` (1 through 4). The program correctly prints the predefined checkerboard patterns for these values. However, the problem statement specifies that `n` can be up to 20. The current implementation does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, as it simply prints "No esta en el rango" for those cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the full requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
