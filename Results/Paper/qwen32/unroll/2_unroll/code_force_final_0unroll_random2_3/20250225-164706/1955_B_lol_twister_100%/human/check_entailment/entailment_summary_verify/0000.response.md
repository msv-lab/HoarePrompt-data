### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A progressive square of size \( n \times n \) is constructed based on the formula \( a_{k,h} = a_{1,1} + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) where \( k, h \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - Given \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and a list of \( n^2 \) integers, determine if the list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and the list \( l \).
   - It calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to determine if the list can form the progressive square.
   
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Finding `a_{1,1}`**: The function sets `a` to the minimum value in the list `l`. This is correct because \( a_{1,1} \) is the smallest element in the progressive square.
   - **Generating the Progressive Square**: The function generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for \( k, h \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \). This is correct as per the problem statement.
   - **Sorting and Comparison**: The function sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` and then compares them. If they are equal, it means the input list can form the progressive square, and it returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. This approach is correct because if the sorted lists match, it confirms that the input list contains exactly the elements of the progressive square.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Duplicates**: The program does not handle duplicates explicitly, but since the progressive square elements are generated uniquely based on the formula, duplicates in the input list should not be a problem as long as the formula generates the same unique elements.
   - **Range of Values**: The values of \( c \) and \( d \) can be up to \( 10^6 \), and \( n \) can be up to 500. The generated values can be up to \( a + (n-1) \cdot c + (n-1) \cdot d \), which can be large but within the range of typical integer operations in Python.

5. **Validation with Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly identifies the smallest element as `a_{1,1}`, generates the progressive square elements using the given formula, and checks if the input list can form the progressive square by comparing sorted lists.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The program correctly identifies the smallest element as \( a_{1,1} \), generates the progressive square elements using the given formula, and checks if the input list can form the progressive square by comparing sorted lists.
