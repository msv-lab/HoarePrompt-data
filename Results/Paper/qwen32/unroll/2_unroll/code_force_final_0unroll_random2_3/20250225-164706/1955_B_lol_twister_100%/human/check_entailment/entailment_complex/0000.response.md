### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged to form a specific progressive square matrix as defined by the parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Determination of the Minimum Value:**
   - The program determines the minimum value `a` in the list `l`. This value is assumed to be `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square matrix.

3. **Generation of the Progressive Square:**
   - The program generates the expected values of the progressive square matrix using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each position `(k, h)` in the matrix. These values are stored in the list `li`.

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The program then compares the sorted list `l` with the sorted list `li`. If they are identical, it means that the list `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square matrix, and the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly reflects the construction rules of the progressive square matrix.
   - The comparison of sorted lists ensures that the program checks if the elements in `l` can be rearranged to match the expected values of the progressive square matrix.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list of integers can form the specified progressive square matrix. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
