Let's analyze the given program and its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - A progressive square of size `n` is an `n x n` matrix.
   - It is constructed using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d`.
   - Given `n`, `c`, and `d`, and an array `b` of `n^2` integers, we need to determine if `b` can be rearranged to form such a progressive square.

2. **Key Points from the Program**:
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It reads the array `l` which contains `n^2` integers.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine if the array `l` can form a progressive square.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l` which is assumed to be `a_{1,1}`.
   - It constructs a list `li` containing all the values `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It sorts both `li` and `l`.
   - It compares the sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program assumes that the smallest number in the array `l` is `a_{1,1}`. This is a reasonable assumption because `a_{1,1}` is the smallest number in the progressive square.
   - The program constructs the list `li` based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all valid `k` and `h`.
   - By sorting both `li` and `l` and comparing them, the program checks if `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square.
   - If the sorted lists are equal, it means that `l` contains exactly the same elements as the progressive square, just possibly in a different order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array `b` can be rearranged to form the progressive square as described in the problem.

**Correctness: True**
