You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the square `n`, and the integers `c` and `d`. Then it reads the list of integers `b` which are the elements found by Maxim. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if the elements in `b` can form a progressive square with the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Here is the function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

### Steps in the Function:
1. **Finding `a_{1,1}`**: The program sets `a` to the minimum value in the list `l`. This is a reasonable assumption since `a_{1,1}` is the smallest element in the progressive square.
2. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
3. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` and then compares them. If they are equal, it means the input list can form the progressive square, and it returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Potential Issues:
The main logic seems correct based on the problem description. However, there are a few points to consider:
- **Correctness of `a_{1,1}`**: The assumption that `a_{1,1}` is the minimum value in the list is correct because `a_{1,1}` is the smallest element in the progressive square.
- **Correctness of the Formula**: The formula `a + k * c + d * h` is correctly used to generate the elements of the progressive square.
- **Sorting and Comparison**: Sorting both lists and comparing them is a valid approach to check if the input list can form the progressive square.

### Edge Cases:
- **Duplicates**: The program does not handle duplicates explicitly, but since the progressive square elements are generated uniquely based on the formula, duplicates in the input list should not be a problem as long as the formula generates the same unique elements.
- **Range of Values**: The values of `c` and `d` can be up to \(10^6\), and `n` can be up to 500. The generated values can be up to \(a + (n-1) * c + (n-1) * d\), which can be large but within the range of typical integer operations in Python.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it appears that it correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The program correctly identifies the smallest element as `a_{1,1}`, generates the progressive square elements using the given formula, and checks if the input list can form the progressive square by comparing sorted lists.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.
