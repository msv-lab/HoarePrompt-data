Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
