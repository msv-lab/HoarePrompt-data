### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, which represent the number of problems and the number of rounds, respectively.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Additional Problems:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEF'` (not including 'G').
   - For each difficulty level in `p`, if that level is not present in the counter `hmp` (i.e., not in the input string), it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need a problem of that difficulty level.
   - For each difficulty level present in `hmp`, if the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `m - hmp[i]` to `ans` to ensure that there are enough problems of that difficulty level for all `m` rounds.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Issues:
- The problem specifies that each round should contain one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. However, the program only considers difficulties 'A' to 'F' and ignores 'G'.
- The program should check for the presence of all difficulties 'A' to 'G' and ensure that each appears at least `m` times.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the difficulty level 'G'. Therefore, it may not provide the correct minimum number of additional problems needed.

**Correctness: False**
