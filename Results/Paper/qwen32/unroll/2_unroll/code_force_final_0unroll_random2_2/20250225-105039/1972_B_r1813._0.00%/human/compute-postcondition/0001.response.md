The code `data = input().split()` reads the entire input string from standard input and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Given the initial state, the input consists of multiple lines where the first line is an integer `t` and the subsequent lines are pairs of an integer `n` and a string `s`. The `split()` method will treat each line break and space as a delimiter, resulting in a flattened list of all the input values.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the entire input string from standard input; `data` is a list containing all the input values split by whitespace.**
