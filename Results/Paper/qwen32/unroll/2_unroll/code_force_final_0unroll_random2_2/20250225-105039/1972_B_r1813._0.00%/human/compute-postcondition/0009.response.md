To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the loop behavior:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `input` is the entire input string from standard input.
   - `data` is a list of values from `input` split by whitespace.
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
   - `index` is calculated as `1 + 2*t`.
   - `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of 'U' characters in each string `s` (presumably each element in `data` after the first one).

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for result in results:
       print(result)
   ```

   The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it.

3. **Output State:**
   - The variables `input`, `data`, `t`, and `index` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
   - The `results` list is printed completely, with each element ('YES' or 'NO') being printed on a new line.

Given the loop only prints the `results` list, the output state will reflect that the `results` have been printed. The other variables retain their initial values.

**Output State:** the `results` list has been printed, with each element ('YES' or 'NO') on a new line. The variables `input`, `data`, `t`, and `index` remain unchanged.
