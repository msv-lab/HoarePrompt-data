You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any direct input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or down).
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `input` is assigned the entire input string from standard input; `data` is a list containing all the input values split by whitespace; `index` is 1 + 2*t; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of 'U' characters in each string `s`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: - The variables `input`, `data`, `t`, and `index` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    #   - The `results` list is printed completely, with each element ('YES' or 'NO') being printed on a new line.
    #
    #Given the loop only prints the `results` list, the output state will reflect that the `results` have been printed. The other variables retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not take any direct input parameters. It reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or down). For each test case, the function returns the number of coins that are facing up ("U").

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
