Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key insight is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always win by playing optimally. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always win by playing optimally. The program counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` for each test case and appends 'YES' to the results if the count is odd, and 'NO' if the count is even. This matches the problem's requirements.
