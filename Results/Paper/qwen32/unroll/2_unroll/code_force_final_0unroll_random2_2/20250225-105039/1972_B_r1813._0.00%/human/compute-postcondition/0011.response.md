Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd, and prints "YES" if it is, or "NO" if it is not.**
