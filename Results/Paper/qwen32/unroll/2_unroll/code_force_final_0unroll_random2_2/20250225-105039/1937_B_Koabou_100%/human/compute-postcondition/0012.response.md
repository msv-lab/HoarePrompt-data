To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`s`**: This variable is defined as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`.
   - `a[0]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `a[1][n - 1]` refers to the last element of the list `a[1]`, assuming `a[1]` is a list of length `n`.

2. **`x`**: This variable is defined as `n - 1`.
   - `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used to index into `a[1]`.

3. **`y`**: This variable is described as "the last updated value of `y` during the loop".
   - However, there is no loop mentioned in the given initial state, so the value of `y` is not determined by any loop in this context. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `y` from the provided information.

4. **`t`**: This variable is defined as `1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(s, sep='')
```
- The `sep=''` argument specifies that there should be no separator between the items printed, but since only one item (`s`) is being printed, this argument does not affect the output.

### Determining the Output:
- We know that `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`.
- Given the lack of specific values for `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `n`, we can only describe `s` in terms of these variables.

Since `y` and `t` are not used in the print statement, we do not need to consider their values.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[0] + a[1][n - 1] (where a[0] is the first element of list a, a[1] is a list, and n is the length of a[1])**
