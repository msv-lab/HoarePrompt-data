You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. The next two lines contain binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × n grid, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `a` is a list containing two binary strings, each of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × `n` grid, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` and `x` is `n - 1`. `y` is the last updated value of `y` during the loop.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is the last updated value of `y` during the loop, `t` is 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: a[0] + a[1][n - 1] (where a[0] is the first element of list a, a[1] is a list, and n is the length of a[1])
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of a 2 × n grid, followed by two binary strings of length `n` that represent the top and bottom rows of the grid. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
