Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i <= n and 1 <= c_i <= n. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are dependent on the subsequent inputs for each test case.
