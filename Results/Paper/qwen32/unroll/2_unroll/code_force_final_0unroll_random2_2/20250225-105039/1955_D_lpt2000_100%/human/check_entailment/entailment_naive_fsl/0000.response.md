Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion of input values correctly. The input values for arrays `aa` and `bb` are converted to strings, which is incorrect because the problem description specifies that the integers in arrays `a` and `b` can be up to \(10^6\). Converting these integers to strings will lead to incorrect comparisons and counting.

Here is a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
4 2 2
1 2 1 2
1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- Subsegment [1, 2] matches [1, 2] (both have 2 matching elements).
- Subsegment [2, 1] matches [1, 2] (both have 2 matching elements).
- Subsegment [1, 2] matches [1, 2] (both have 2 matching elements).

However, with the given program, the input values will be treated as strings, leading to incorrect matching and counting.

To fix this, the conversion of input values to strings should be removed, and the input values should be kept as integers:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        (n, m, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]  # Convert to integers
        bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]  # Convert to integers
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        E = cnt_aa - D
        C = cnt_bb - D
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        for (in_aa, out_aa) in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                D[in_aa] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[in_aa] -= 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        print(fnd)

func()
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all test cases.
