Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct in terms of logic, but it fails to handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem statement, the output should be one of the letters (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B}), but the program does not specify a preference in this scenario. The problem description does not explicitly define what to do when the counts are equal, but the given output examples suggest that it should prefer 'A' in such cases.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        elif bc > ac:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # In case of a tie, print 'A'

func()
```

This ensures that 'A' is printed when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, which aligns with the provided examples.
