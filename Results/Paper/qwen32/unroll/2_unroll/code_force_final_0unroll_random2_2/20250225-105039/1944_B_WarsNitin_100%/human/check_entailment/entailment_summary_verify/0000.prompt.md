You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    for q in range(t):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

- Function Summary: 
For each test case, the function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then constructs two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, each containing `2 * k` integers, ensuring that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice across both lists. The function outputs these two lists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2` for all test cases. The logic used in the program is not robust enough to guarantee the required property.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
The program should output two lines of 4 integers each, such that the bitwise XOR of the integers in the first line equals the bitwise XOR of the integers in the second line. For example:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
or any other valid pair of subsets that satisfy the condition.

**Actual Output:**
The provided program might output something like:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
```
or other incorrect combinations because the logic does not ensure that both `ans1` and `ans2` have exactly `2k` elements and that their XOR values are equal.

**Why the Program is Incorrect:**
The program attempts to construct `ans1` and `ans2` by appending elements from the sorted halves `b` and `c` of the input array `a`. However, it does not guarantee that both `ans1` and `ans2` will have exactly `2k` elements, and it does not ensure that their XOR values are equal. The logic for appending elements to `ans1` and `ans2` is flawed and can lead to incorrect results.

To fix the program, a more systematic approach is needed to ensure that both `ans1` and `ans2` have exactly `2k` elements and that their XOR values are equal. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm or a backtracking approach to find valid subsets `l` and `r` that satisfy the conditions.
