You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The lists `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case, each containing `2 * k` integers, ensuring each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice across both lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:For each test case, the function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then constructs two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, each containing `2 * k` integers, ensuring that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice across both lists. The function outputs these two lists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that:
- `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of the array `a`.
- `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of the array `a`.
- The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The key observation is that since each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the array `a`, we can always find pairs of elements that can be used to form `l` and `r` while maintaining the XOR condition.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
3. It splits `a` into two halves `b` and `c`.
4. It sorts both halves.
5. It initializes `ans1` and `ans2` to store the elements of `l` and `r`, respectively.
6. It enters a loop to find elements for `ans1` and `ans2`:
   - It first adds elements that appear only once in `b` to a temporary list `l`.
   - It then adds pairs of equal elements from `b` to `ans1` until `k` elements are added.
   - It does the same for `c` to add pairs of equal elements to `ans2`.
   - It finally adds elements from `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2` until `k` elements are added to each.
7. It prints `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Issues in the Program
The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:
1. **Handling of `k`**: The variable `k` is initially set to `2 * k` but then reset to `req` after processing `b`. This can cause incorrect behavior if `k` is not properly managed.
2. **Selection of Elements**: The program does not guarantee that the XOR of `ans1` will be equal to the XOR of `ans2`. It simply adds elements without considering the XOR condition.
3. **Incomplete Handling of `l`**: The program does not ensure that `l` is used effectively to balance the XOR values between `ans1` and `ans2`.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `k` is equal to `n/2` or other edge cases properly.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of `l` and `r` are equal. It also does not handle the selection of elements in a way that guarantees a valid solution for all test cases.
