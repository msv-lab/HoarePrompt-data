Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that `y` = 0; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In simple terms, `T` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. All other variables and conditions remain as they were initially described.
