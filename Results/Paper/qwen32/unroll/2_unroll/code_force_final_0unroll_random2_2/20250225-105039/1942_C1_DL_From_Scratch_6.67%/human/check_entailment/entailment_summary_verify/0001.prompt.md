You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the gaps between the integers in the list and the number of integers. Specifically, it counts the number of gaps of size 1 between the integers in the sorted list and adds this count to `x - 2`, then prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing diagonals between vertices of a regular polygon. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n, and some vertices are already chosen. We cannot add any more vertices (y = 0), so we must work with the given vertices.

### Key Points

1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We can only use the vertices that are already chosen to draw diagonals.
2. **Triangles Formation**: Triangles can be formed by selecting three vertices such that no other vertices are inside the triangle.
3. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: Diagonals should not cross each other inside the polygon.

### Solution Analysis

The given solution involves the following steps:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of sides of the polygon (n), the number of vertices already chosen (x), and the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen (y, which is always 0 in this case).
2. **Sorting**: The vertices that are already chosen are sorted in ascending order.
3. **Counting**: The program counts the number of consecutive vertex pairs that have exactly one vertex between them (i.e., the difference between the indices is 2). Each such pair can form a triangle with the adjacent vertices.
4. **Edge Case**: It also checks if the last vertex is adjacent to the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic) and counts it if true.
5. **Output**: Finally, it outputs the total number of triangles that can be formed, which is calculated as the count of such pairs plus (x - 2).

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if this approach works:

- **Counting Consecutive Pairs**: The logic to count pairs of vertices that are consecutive (with exactly one vertex in between) is correct. Each such pair can indeed form a triangle with the adjacent vertices.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the cyclic nature of the polygon by checking if the last vertex is adjacent to the first vertex.
- **Output Formula**: The output formula `count + x - 2` is correct. The `count` variable holds the number of triangles formed by the identified pairs, and `x - 2` accounts for the triangles that can be formed by connecting the remaining vertices.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed with the given vertices.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
