### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the given examples.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Friendship Pairs and Values**: We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends, each with a specific friendship value `f_i`.
2. **Random Selection of Pairs**: The teacher randomly selects `k` pairs of children for excursions.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of the `k` pairs chosen for excursions. This value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: It calculates the sum of all initial friendship values (`sum_f`).
3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - `cn2` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The program calculates `p` and `q` based on the formula derived from the problem:
     - \( p = 2k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \)
     - \( q = 2 \cdot cn2^2 \)
4. **Simplification and Modulo Operation**: The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Finally, it computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\) using Python's `pow` function with three arguments, which efficiently computes the modular inverse.

#### Verification with Examples:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - `n = 100`, `m = 0`, `k = 24`
   - No friendship pairs, so `sum_f = 0`.
   - \( p = 2 \cdot 24 \cdot 4950 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 = 0 \)
   - \( q = 2 \cdot 4950^2 \)
   - The result is \( \frac{0}{q} = 0 \).

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 10`
   - Only one friendship pair with `f = 1`.
   - \( p = 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 = 20 + 90 = 110 \)
   - \( q = 2 \cdot 1^2 = 2 \)
   - The result is \( \frac{110}{2} = 55 \).

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 4`
   - Two friendship pairs with `f = 25` and `f = 24`.
   - \( sum_f = 25 + 24 = 49 \)
   - \( p = 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 10 \cdot 49 + 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 3920 + 24 = 3944 \)
   - \( q = 2 \cdot 10^2 = 200 \)
   - The result is \( \frac{3944}{200} = \frac{986}{50} = \frac{493}{25} \)
   - Simplifying, we get \( \frac{493}{25} \), and \( 493 \cdot 25^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) = 777777784 \).

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 4`
   - Two friendship pairs with `f = 25` and `f = 24`.
   - The calculations are similar to the third test case.
   - The result is \( 40000020 \).
