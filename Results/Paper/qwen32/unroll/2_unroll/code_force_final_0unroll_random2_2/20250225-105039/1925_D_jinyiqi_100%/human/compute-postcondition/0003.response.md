To determine the output state after executing the loop, we need to understand the operations performed within the loop. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads values `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of input representing pairs of friends and a value `f_i` for each pair. The loop calculates a specific formula using these values and prints the result modulo `M` (1000000007).

Here's a breakdown of the operations:
1. **Initialization**: `sum_f` is initialized to 0.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The loop reads `m` pairs and their associated `f_i` values, adding each `f_i` to `sum_f`.
3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: It calculates `cn2` as the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
4. **Formula Calculation**: It calculates `p` and `q`:
   - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
   - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
5. **Simplification**: It simplifies `p` and `q` by dividing both by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
6. **Modulo Operation**: It calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` and multiplies it by `p`, then takes the result modulo `M`.

After all iterations, the state of the variables not directly involved in the loop (like `t`, `M`, and the input values for each iteration) remains unchanged. The only variables that change are `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, and the printed result.

Since the loop runs `t` times and each iteration processes different inputs, there isn't a single final state for `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, or `gcd` that can be described universally. However, the output for each iteration is printed, and these outputs are the only observable results after the loop completes.

Therefore, the output state is best described as the series of printed results for each iteration. Since we do not have specific input values, we cannot provide a concrete numerical output state. However, we can describe the output state in terms of what is printed.

Output State: **The printed results of the formula for each of the t iterations, each result being an integer between 0 and 1000000006.**
