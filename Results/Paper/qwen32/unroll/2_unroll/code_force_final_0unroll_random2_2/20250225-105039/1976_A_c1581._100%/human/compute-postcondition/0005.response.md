Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; digits is a list containing all the digit characters from the password in sorted order; letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password in sorted order.**

Explanation: The `letters.sort()` command sorts the `letters` list in ascending order. Since the initial state already specifies that `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password, sorting it will simply reorder the list to be in alphabetical order. The `digits` list and the `password` string remain unchanged.
