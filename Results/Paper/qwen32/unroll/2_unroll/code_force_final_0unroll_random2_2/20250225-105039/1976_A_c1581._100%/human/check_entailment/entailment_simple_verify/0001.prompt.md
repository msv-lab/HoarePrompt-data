You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem.

### Conditions for a Strong Password:
1. **Password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits**: This is assumed to be handled elsewhere in the code (not shown), and the problem states valid inputs are provided.
2. **There should be no digit that comes after a letter**: This means all letters must come before any digits.
3. **All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order**: This means the digits should be in ascending order.
4. **All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order**: This means the letters should be in ascending order.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- The code correctly separates the password into digits and letters.
- It sorts the digits and letters separately.
- It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order, but this check is redundant since the digits are already sorted using `sort()`.
- It checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter, ensuring all letters come before any digits.
- It then constructs a new sorted password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
- Finally, it checks if the newly constructed sorted password matches the original password.

### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not explicitly check if all letters are in non-decreasing order after sorting, but since `letters.sort()` is called, this is implicitly handled.
- The code does not handle the scenario where there are no digits or no letters, but this is also implicitly handled because the checks and concatenation will be valid in these cases.
- There is a logical flaw in the way the code checks if the password is strong. Specifically, the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]` is incorrect. It should ensure that all letters are before any digits, not just compare the last digit with the first letter.

### Corrected Check:
Instead of `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]`, the code should check if there are any digits and letters and ensure that the first digit (if any) comes after the last letter (if any). This can be done by checking if the password is equal to the concatenation of the sorted letters and sorted digits.

### Corrected Code:
```python
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    sortedPassword = ''.join(letters + digits)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has a logical flaw in the check for the order of digits and letters. The corrected code provided above addresses this issue.
