### Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) in a permutation \( p \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) is maximized. The solution provided uses a strategy involving bitwise OR comparisons to identify such indices within the constraints of at most \( 3n \) queries per test case.

Let's break down the solution:

1. **Initialization and First Loop**:
   - The variable `v1` is initialized to 0.
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \). For each iteration, it compares the bitwise OR of \( p_{v1} \) with itself and \( p_i \) with itself. The query is of the form \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \).
   - If the response is "<", it means \( p_{v1} \mid p_{v1} < p_i \mid p_i \). Since \( p_{v1} \mid p_{v1} = p_{v1} \) and similarly for \( p_i \), this implies \( p_{v1} < p_i \). Thus, `v1` is updated to \( i \).
   - The purpose of this loop is to find the index \( v1 \) of the maximum element in the permutation \( p \).

2. **Second Loop**:
   - The variable `prev` is initialized to 0.
   - The second loop also iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \). For each iteration, it compares the bitwise OR of \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \) and \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_{prev} \). The query is of the form \( ? \, v1 \, i \, v1 \, prev \).
   - If the response is ">", it means \( p_{v1} \mid p_i > p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \). This implies that the XOR of \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \) could potentially be larger than the XOR of \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_{prev} \). Thus, `prev` is updated to \( i \).
   - The purpose of this loop is to find the index \( prev \) such that the XOR of \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_{prev} \) is maximized.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loops, the pair \( (prev, v1) \) is printed as the indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Analysis:
- The first loop ensures that `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
- The second loop finds the index `prev` such that the XOR of the maximum element with the element at `prev` is maximized.
- The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly finds the pair of indices that maximize the XOR value within the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
