The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads an integer from the input. This function does not affect any other variables or the state of the program except for defining `R` itself. The initial state mentions multiple test cases and the function `I` for reading and processing input, but these are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the input. There are multiple test cases, each containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, you can ask up to 3n queries in the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs (p_a, p_b) and (p_c, p_d). The interactor will respond with "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison. After finding a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, you must print "! i j". The total number of queries across all test cases must not exceed 3 times the sum of all n values, which is at most 3 * 10^4. The function `I` is defined to read and process input as a list of integers.**
