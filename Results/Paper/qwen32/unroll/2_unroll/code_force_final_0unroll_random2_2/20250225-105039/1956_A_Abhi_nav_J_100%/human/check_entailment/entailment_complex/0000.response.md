### Reasoning:
The provided program logic does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate one round of the game and determine the number of players remaining after that round. However, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect.
   - The function currently returns `a - 1` if `a <= b`, and `b` otherwise. This does not reflect the game rules where specific players are removed based on their positions (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_k`).

2. **Game Simulation:**
   - The game requires iteratively removing players at specific positions (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_k`) until no players can be removed in a round.
   - The function needs to simulate this process accurately, removing players and adjusting the list of remaining players accordingly.

### Correct Implementation Outline:
- **Initialization:** Start with a list of players from `1` to `b`.
- **Simulation Loop:** While there are players to be removed:
  - Identify and remove players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` if they exist.
  - Adjust the list of remaining players.
- **Output:** The number of players left after no more players can be removed.

### Conclusion:
Given the current implementation of `func_1` and the overall logic, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
