Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it can hold a maximum of 15 1x1 icons.
2. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and there are specific positions on the 5x3 grid where these can be placed without overlapping.
3. **Placement Strategy**:
    - First, place as many 2x2 icons as possible.
    - After placing the 2x2 icons, place the remaining 1x1 icons.
4. **Calculation**:
    - Calculate how many screens are needed for the 2x2 icons.
    - Calculate how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `a` and 2x2 icons `b`.
2. **Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
    - `t = b` initially.
    - If `t` (number of 2x2 icons) is even, `t = t // 2` (since each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons).
    - If `t` is odd, `t = t // 2 + 1`.
3. **Calculation of Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
    - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
    - If `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed for 1x1 icons.
    - If `t1 < a`, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`), and add these to `t`.
4. **Output**:
    - The program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases to ensure correctness.

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
    - 1 2x2 icon requires 1 screen.
    - Remaining space: `15 - 4 = 11`.
    - 1 1x1 icon can fit in the remaining space.
    - Output: `1`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
    - 2 2x2 icons require 1 screen.
    - Remaining space: `15 - 8 = 7`.
    - 7 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.
    - Output: `1`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
    - 4 2x2 icons require 2 screens.
    - Remaining space: `30 - 16 = 14`.
    - 12 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.
    - Output: `2`.

4. **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
    - 9 2x2 icons require 5 screens.
    - Output: `5`.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid.

**Correctness: True**
