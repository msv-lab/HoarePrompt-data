The given code attempts to compute the square root of the list `q` using `math.sqrt(q)`. However, the `math.sqrt()` function is not applicable to lists or tuples directly. It expects a single numeric value. Therefore, the code will raise a `TypeError`.

Given the context, since the code will raise an error, the variables `q` and `M` will remain unchanged. The variable `w` will not be assigned a value because the line of code that assigns it will not execute successfully.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `q` contains between 1 and 100 such tuples; `M` is an empty list; a TypeError will be raised.**
