Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), where n is the number of problems in the bank and m is the number of upcoming rounds. This is followed by a string a of length n, consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.**
