Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of additional problems needed. Specifically, it does not correctly account for the requirement that each round should contain one problem of each difficulty level 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. The program only considers difficulties 'A' to 'F' and does not handle 'G'. Additionally, it does not correctly handle cases where the number of problems of a particular difficulty is already sufficient for `m` rounds.

Here's a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

Explanation of the issue:
- The input string "ABCDEFG" contains one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- Since `m=1`, Vlad only needs one problem of each difficulty level, which he already has.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates that he needs one more problem because it does not consider 'G' in the set of required difficulties.

Another test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
6 2
ABCDEF
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
```

**Actual Output:**
```
6
```

Explanation of the issue:
- The input string "ABCDEF" contains one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'F'.
- Since `m=2`, Vlad needs two problems of each difficulty level, which he does not have.
- The program incorrectly calculates that he needs six more problems because it does not consider 'G', but it should actually need seven more problems (one 'G' and one more of each 'A' to 'F').

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these logical errors.
