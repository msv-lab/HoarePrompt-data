Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum score for the given problem. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Logic for Computing the Result**: The program attempts to compute the result by adjusting the counts of cards to make them as equal as possible, but the logic for handling the remaining cards and computing the final score is flawed.

2. **Handling the Remaining Coins**: The program calculates the remainder of coins after making the counts of cards as equal as possible, but it does not correctly distribute these remaining coins to maximize the score.

3. **Final Score Calculation**: The final score is calculated incorrectly. The program adds the remainder and the number of cards that were not fully adjusted, which does not necessarily maximize the score.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the minimum number of cards we can have for each type after buying k cards
        a.sort()
        total = 0
        for i in range(n):
            total += (i + 1) * (a[i] - a[0])
            if total > k:
                break
        
        if total <= k:
            # If we can make all counts equal to a[n-1]
            target = a[n-1] + (k - total) // n
            rem = (k - total) % n
            print((target - 1) * n + rem)
        else:
            # Otherwise, we find the maximum target we can achieve
            for i in range(n):
                if (i + 1) * (a[i] - a[0]) > k:
                    target = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                    rem = k % (i + 1)
                    break
            print((target - 1) * n + rem)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program correctly computes the target number of cards for each type after buying `k` cards and calculates the maximum score based on this target.
