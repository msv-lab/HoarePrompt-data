To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the logic of the provided code. The code processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `r` based on the given conditions and prints a result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, `n` and `k` are read, along with the list `a` of `n` integers. The list `a` is then sorted.
2. **Processing**: The code iterates through the sorted list `a` to determine the value `r` that satisfies the conditions:
   - It checks if the remaining `k` can cover the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `k` is sufficient to cover the difference, it subtracts the required amount from `k` and moves to the next element.
   - If `k` is not sufficient to cover the difference, it calculates the value `r` as the current element plus the integer division of the remaining `k` by the number of elements processed so far.
   - The remainder `rem` and the number of elements left `y` are also calculated.
3. **Final Calculation**: After the loop, if `k` is still non-zero, it calculates the final result using the last element of the list `a` and the remaining `k`. Otherwise, it uses the previously calculated `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

The output for each test case is printed as `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` or `(r - 1) * n + 1` based on whether `k` was fully used or not.

Given the nature of the problem, the output state after all iterations will be a series of printed results for each test case. Since the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` changes with each iteration, the final output state is a series of printed results rather than a single state of variables.

However, if we need to describe the output state in terms of the variables involved, we can say that the variables `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` will be in a state that reflects the last processed test case, but the primary output is the series of printed results.

Thus, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **A series of printed results for each test case, where each result is calculated based on the conditions described in the code.**
