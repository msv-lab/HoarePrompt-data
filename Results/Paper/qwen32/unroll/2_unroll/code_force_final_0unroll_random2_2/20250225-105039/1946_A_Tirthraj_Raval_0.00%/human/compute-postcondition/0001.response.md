The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
