The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 since the loop iterates `t` times. The value of `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 to 500, no further adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, `i` is not yet initialized**
