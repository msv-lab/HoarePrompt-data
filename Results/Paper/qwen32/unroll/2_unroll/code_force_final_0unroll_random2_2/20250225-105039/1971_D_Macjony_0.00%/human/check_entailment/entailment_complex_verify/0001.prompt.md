You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single binary string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1

            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The printed count values for each of the `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` binary strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1', and prints the count of segments of consecutive identical characters minus one if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) into which a given binary string can be cut such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all 0s followed by all 1s).

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string. It then calculates the minimum number of pieces needed for each string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `count` to 1 (since at least one piece is needed) and `flag` to `False`.
2. **Loop through the string**: It iterates through the string using a while loop.
3. **Count transitions**: Whenever it encounters a transition from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0', it increases the `count` by 1.
4. **Special flag handling**: If it encounters a '0' followed by a '1', it sets `flag` to `True` and skips the next character (though this part seems redundant and incorrect, as it doesn't align with the logic of counting transitions).
5. **Adjust count if flag is set**: After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.
6. **Output the result**: It prints the final `count` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect handling of transitions**: The program increments `count` for every transition, but the decrement based on the `flag` is incorrect and unnecessary. The `flag` is set when a '0' is followed by a '1', but it doesn't need to be decremented because every transition already accounts for a new piece.
- **Redundant logic**: The `flag` and the decrement operation are not required based on the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach
The correct approach is to simply count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and add 1 (since the first segment before any transition also counts as a piece). This can be done without the `flag` and the decrement operation.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of pieces. The program's logic is flawed and does not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
