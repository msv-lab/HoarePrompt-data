You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the game rules and the logic implemented in the program.

### Game Analysis:

1. **Anna's Turn:**
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number. Leading zeros are removed.
   - The number of elements in the list remains the same.

2. **Sasha's Turn:**
   - Sasha concatenates two different numbers from the list in any order and inserts the concatenated number back into the list.
   - The number of elements in the list decreases by 1.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The game ends when only one number is left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the remaining number is not less than \(10^m\).
   - Anna wins otherwise.

### Strategy:
- **Anna's Strategy**: Anna aims to minimize the final number to ensure it is less than \(10^m\).
- **Sasha's Strategy**: Sasha aims to maximize the final number to ensure it is at least \(10^m\).

### Key Observations:
- **Reversing Digits**: Reversing the digits of a number does not change its length. It may change the number, but the number of digits remains the same.
- **Concatenation**: Concatenating two numbers increases the total number of digits by the sum of the digits of the two numbers.

### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **`tot` Calculation**: `tot` is the total number of digits in all numbers in the list.
  - **`cntvals` Calculation**: `cntvals` is a list of the number of trailing zeros for each number in the list. This list is sorted in descending order.
  - **Loop**: The loop iterates over `cntvals` in steps of 2, subtracting the value from `tot`. This suggests that Sasha is removing pairs of numbers, and Anna is reversing numbers (which do not affect the total digit count).
  - **Winning Condition**: The program checks if `tot` (after the loop) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

- **Function `zerocnts`**:
  - This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.

### Correctness:
- The logic in the program is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the game's dynamics. The key issue is that the program does not consider the actual concatenation process and its impact on the final number's value.
- The program only considers the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, which is insufficient to determine the final number's value after optimal play.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules and optimal play strategies.

**Correctness: False**
