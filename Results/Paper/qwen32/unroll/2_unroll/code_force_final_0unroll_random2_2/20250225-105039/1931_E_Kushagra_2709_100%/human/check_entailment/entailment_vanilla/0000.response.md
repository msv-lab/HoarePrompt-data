Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - **Anna's Turn**: Reverses the digits of one number. Leading zeros are removed.
   - **Sasha's Turn**: Concatenates two numbers in any order and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when there is only one number left in the list.
   - **Winning Condition**: If the final number is not less than 10^m, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - **Anna's Move**: The reversal of digits doesn't change the total number of digits in the list. It only rearranges them.
   - **Sasha's Move**: This operation reduces the number of elements by one and increases the total number of digits in the list by one less than the sum of digits of the two numbers being concatenated.
   - **Total Digits**: The total number of digits in the list after all possible moves is the sum of the initial number of digits minus the number of concatenations performed by Sasha.

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - Sasha wins if the total number of digits in the final number is greater than or equal to m + 1.
   - Since Anna can only rearrange digits without changing the total number of digits, the only way Sasha can influence the total number of digits is through concatenation.
   - Sasha will always concatenate numbers optimally to maximize the total number of digits.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: `n` (number of integers), `m` (parameter for winning condition), `nums` (list of integers).
   - **Logic**:
     - **Total Digits Calculation**: `tot` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the numbers.
     - **Zero Counts**: `cntvals` stores the count of trailing zeros for each number, sorted in descending order.
     - **Sasha's Optimal Moves**: The program assumes that Sasha will skip concatenating numbers with the highest trailing zeros, effectively reducing the total number of digits by the count of these zeros. This is done by subtracting the counts of trailing zeros of every second number in the sorted list.
     - **Winning Condition**: If the resulting `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - **Input**: `num` (integer).
   - **Logic**: Counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.

### Correctness:

- The primary assumption in the program is that Sasha will skip concatenating numbers with the highest trailing zeros, which is not necessarily true. Sasha can concatenate any two numbers to maximize the total number of digits, and the optimal strategy is not simply skipping numbers with the most trailing zeros.
- The program does not account for the optimal concatenation strategy by Sasha, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner based on optimal play by both players. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
