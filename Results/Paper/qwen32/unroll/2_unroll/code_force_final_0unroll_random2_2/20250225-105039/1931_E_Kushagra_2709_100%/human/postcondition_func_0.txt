The function determines the winner of a game between Sasha and Anna based on the sum of the number of digits in a list of integers (`nums`), adjusted by subtracting the sum of every second element in a list of zero counts in the binary representations of those integers. The function returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted sum is greater than or equal to `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
