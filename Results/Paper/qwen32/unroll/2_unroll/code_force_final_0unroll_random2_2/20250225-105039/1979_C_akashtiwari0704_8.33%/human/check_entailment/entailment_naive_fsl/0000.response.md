Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the bets. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's take a closer look at the example provided in the problem statement:

For the input:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The program calculates:
- `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- Then it sets `a[0] = 42 // 3 = 14`, `a[1] = 42 // 2 = 21`, `a[2] = 42 // 7 = 6`
- The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
- The returns are `3 * 14 = 42`, `2 * 21 = 42`, `7 * 6 = 42`

While this solution works for this example, it is not guaranteed to work for all cases. For instance, consider the following case:

Input:
```
3
2 2 2
```
The program calculates:
- `prod = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`
- Then it sets `a[0] = 8 // 2 = 4`, `a[1] = 8 // 2 = 4`, `a[2] = 8 // 2 = 4`
- The total bet is `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
- The returns are `2 * 4 = 8`, `2 * 4 = 8`, `2 * 4 = 8`

Here, the total bet (12) is not less than the returns for any winning outcome, which violates the problem's requirement.

A correct approach would be to set each bet to 1 and verify if the sum of bets is less than the minimum return. If not, then it is impossible to distribute the coins as required.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
