You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #State: a series of outputs for each test case, where each output is either `-1` or a space-separated string of the modified list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a modified list where each element is the product of all elements in `k` divided by the element itself. It then checks if the sum of the modified list is greater than or equal to the product of all elements in `k`. If true, it outputs `-1`; otherwise, it outputs the modified list as a space-separated string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that, for each outcome, the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received if that outcome wins. Specifically, if you bet `x_i` coins on the `i-th` outcome and it wins, you receive `k_i * x_i` coins back, where `k_i` is the multiplier for the `i-th` outcome.

The key requirement is that the sum of all bets `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n` must be strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `n`.
   - It reads the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then calculates the bets `x_i` as `prod // k_i` for each `i`.
   - It sums these bets and checks if the sum is less than `prod`.
   - If the sum is not less than `prod`, it prints `-1` (indicating no valid distribution).
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets.

### Flaw in the Program

The main issue with the program is the way it calculates the bets `x_i` and checks the condition.

- The program calculates `x_i` as `prod // k_i`, which means each bet is the product of all multipliers divided by the current multiplier. This approach does not guarantee that the sum of all bets is less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.
- The program checks if the sum of all bets is less than `prod`. However, the correct condition should be that the sum of all bets is less than `k_i * x_i` for each individual `i`, not the product of all multipliers.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The approach to calculate the bets and the condition to check the validity of the distribution are flawed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
