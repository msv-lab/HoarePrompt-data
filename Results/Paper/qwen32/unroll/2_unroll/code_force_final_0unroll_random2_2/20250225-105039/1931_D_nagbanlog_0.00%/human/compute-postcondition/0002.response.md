Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in `test_cases` is a tuple where the first element is an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the second and third elements are integers `x` and `y` such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9; the fourth element is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.**
