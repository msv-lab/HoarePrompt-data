You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and returns the count of "beautiful pairs" in the list, where a "beautiful pair" is defined based on specific modulo conditions involving `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The program provided does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem description. The logic for determining the required pairs is flawed.

The issue arises from the way the program calculates and uses `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that for a number `num` with `mod_x` and `mod_y`, the pair can be formed with another number that has a `mod_x` of `(x - mod_x) % x` and the same `mod_y`. This is not necessarily true for all cases.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 3 2
1 2 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Pairs: (1, 4) and (2, 5)
  - For (1, 4): `1 + 4 = 5` (divisible by 3) and `1 - 4 = -3` (divisible by 2)
  - For (2, 5): `2 + 5 = 7` (not divisible by 3) and `2 - 5 = -3` (divisible by 2)
  - For (1, 5): `1 + 5 = 6` (divisible by 3) and `1 - 5 = -4` (not divisible by 2)
  - For (2, 4): `2 + 4 = 6` (divisible by 3) and `2 - 4 = -2` (divisible by 2)

So, the beautiful pairs are (1, 4) and (2, 4), giving a total of 2 pairs.

However, the provided code will not correctly count these pairs because of the way it calculates the required modulo values. Specifically, for `num = 1` with `mod_x = 1` and `mod_y = 1`, it looks for another number with `mod_x = 2` and `mod_y = 1`, which does not exist in the array. Similarly, for `num = 2` with `mod_x = 2` and `mod_y = 0`, it looks for another number with `mod_x = 1` and `mod_y = 0`, which also does not exist.

The correct approach would involve checking each pair `(i, j)` directly to see if both conditions are satisfied, or using a more sophisticated counting method that correctly handles the modulo conditions.

Thus, the program is incorrect and does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
