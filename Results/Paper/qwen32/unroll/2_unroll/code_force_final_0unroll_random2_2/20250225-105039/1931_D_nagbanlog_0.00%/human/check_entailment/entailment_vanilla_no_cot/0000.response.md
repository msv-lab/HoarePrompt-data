Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic for determining the beautiful pairs is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which is not the correct approach to find a pair `(i, j)` such that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. Instead, you should be looking for pairs where the sum of the remainders modulo `x` is `0` or `x`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = (y - mod_y) % y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

However, the above fix still doesn't account for the case where `mod_x + mod_x == x` or `mod_y + mod_y == y`. We need to handle these cases separately. Here's a fully corrected version:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = (y - mod_y) % y
            
            # Check for pairs where a_i + a_j is divisible by x
            if (required_mod_x, mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, mod_y]
            if (mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[mod_x, mod_y]
            
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count // 2)  # Each pair is counted twice
    return results
```

In this corrected version, we properly account for both conditions and ensure that each pair is only counted once.
