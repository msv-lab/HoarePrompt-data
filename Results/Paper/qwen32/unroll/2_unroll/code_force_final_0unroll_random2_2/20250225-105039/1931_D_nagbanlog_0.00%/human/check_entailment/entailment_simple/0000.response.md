### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program uses a frequency dictionary (`freq`) to keep track of the pairs of remainders \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) encountered so far. For each number in the array, it calculates the required pair of remainders that would make the current number form a beautiful pair with a previously encountered number. If such a pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `freq` as an empty dictionary and `beautiful_count` as 0.
2. **Loop through the array**: For each number `num` in the array `a`:
   - It calculates `mod_x` as `num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - It calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is because for a pair \((a_i, a_j)\) to satisfy \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\), we need \(a_j \equiv -a_i \equiv (x - a_i \% x) \pmod{x}\).
   - `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y` because for the pair to satisfy \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), we need \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\).
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is already in `freq`, it means there are numbers encountered before that can form a beautiful pair with the current number, so it increments `beautiful_count` by the frequency of this pair.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

3. **Return results**: After processing all test cases, the program returns a list of counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic appears correct based on the problem description and the provided example. The program efficiently counts the beautiful pairs using a single pass through the array for each test case, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
