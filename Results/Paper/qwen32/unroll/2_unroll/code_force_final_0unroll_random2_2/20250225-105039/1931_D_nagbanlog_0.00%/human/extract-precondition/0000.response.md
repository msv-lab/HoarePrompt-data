Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple where the first element is an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the second and third elements are integers x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9. The fourth element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
