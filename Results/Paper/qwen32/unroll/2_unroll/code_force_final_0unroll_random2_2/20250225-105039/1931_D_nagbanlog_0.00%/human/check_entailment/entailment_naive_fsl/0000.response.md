Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The program provided does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem description. The logic for determining the required pairs is flawed.

The issue arises from the way the program calculates and uses `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that for a number `num` with `mod_x` and `mod_y`, the pair can be formed with another number that has a `mod_x` of `(x - mod_x) % x` and the same `mod_y`. This is not necessarily true for all cases.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 3 2
1 2 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Pairs: (1, 4) and (2, 5)
  - For (1, 4): `1 + 4 = 5` (divisible by 3) and `1 - 4 = -3` (divisible by 2)
  - For (2, 5): `2 + 5 = 7` (not divisible by 3) and `2 - 5 = -3` (divisible by 2)
  - For (1, 5): `1 + 5 = 6` (divisible by 3) and `1 - 5 = -4` (not divisible by 2)
  - For (2, 4): `2 + 4 = 6` (divisible by 3) and `2 - 4 = -2` (divisible by 2)

So, the beautiful pairs are (1, 4) and (2, 4), giving a total of 2 pairs.

However, the provided code will not correctly count these pairs because of the way it calculates the required modulo values. Specifically, for `num = 1` with `mod_x = 1` and `mod_y = 1`, it looks for another number with `mod_x = 2` and `mod_y = 1`, which does not exist in the array. Similarly, for `num = 2` with `mod_x = 2` and `mod_y = 0`, it looks for another number with `mod_x = 1` and `mod_y = 0`, which also does not exist.

The correct approach would involve checking each pair `(i, j)` directly to see if both conditions are satisfied, or using a more sophisticated counting method that correctly handles the modulo conditions.

Thus, the program is incorrect and does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
