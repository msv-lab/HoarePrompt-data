You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of lists containing only the characters '0' and '1'. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1 (i.e., it consists of more than one '1').

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle Shapes**:
    - The program checks if any row has exactly one '1'. If it finds such a row, it immediately concludes that the shape is a triangle. However, a triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of '1's, not just one row with a single '1'. For example, a triangle with k=3 would have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's respectively. The current logic would incorrectly identify this as a triangle based on the row with a single '1'.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Square Shapes**:
    - The program checks if any row has more than one '1'. If it finds such a row, it concludes that the shape is a square. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. A square requires that all rows have the same number of '1's, and these '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. The current logic does not check these conditions.

3. **Edge Cases Not Considered**:
    - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle. It only checks for triangles that are oriented with their base at the bottom.
    - The program does not correctly handle cases where the shape is a square. It only checks if a row has more than one '1', which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square.

Here is an example input that demonstrates the incorrectness of the program:

**Input:**
```
1
5
00111
00010
00000
00000
00000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

The program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because it finds a row with more than one '1'. However, this shape is actually a triangle.

To correctly determine the shape, the program needs to implement logic to check for both the triangle and square conditions as described in the problem statement.
