Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly identifies whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a square or a triangle.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Square Shape**: 
   - Consists of `k` (k > 1) consecutive rows, each with `k` consecutive '1's.
   - The '1's are aligned such that they form a perfect square.

2. **Triangle Shape**:
   - Consists of `k` (k > 1) consecutive rows.
   - The i-th row has `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's.
   - The central '1's are aligned in a single column.
   - An upside-down triangle is also considered valid.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program reads `t` test cases, each with an `n x n` grid. For each test case, it reads `n` lines of the grid and checks the number of '1's in each row.

#### Key Points of the Program:
- If a row has exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
- If a row has more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.
- After processing all rows, it prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is not zero (i.e., if any row had exactly one '1'), otherwise it prints 'SQUARE'.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Triangle Detection**:
   - The program only checks if a row has exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, specifically `2*i - 1` '1's in the i-th row.
   
2. **Square Detection**:
   - The program only checks if a row has more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. This is incorrect because a square requires each of the `k` rows to have exactly `k` '1's, and all rows must have the same number of '1's aligned in a square shape.

3. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to check for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square. It incorrectly assumes that the presence of a row with one '1' or more than one '1' is sufficient to determine the shape.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a square or a triangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
