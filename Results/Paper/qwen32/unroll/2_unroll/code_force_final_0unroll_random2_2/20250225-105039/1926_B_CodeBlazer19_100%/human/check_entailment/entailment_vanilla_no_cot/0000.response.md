Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Triangle Detection**: The program checks if any row has exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. This is not a valid check for a triangle as per the problem description. A triangle can have rows with more than one '1', and the number of '1's in each row should follow a specific pattern (2*i - 1 for the i-th row).

2. **Incorrect Square Detection**: The program checks if any row has more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. This is also not sufficient. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and these '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

3. **Logic for Printing the Result**: The program uses variables `a` and `b` to store the result, but it does not correctly handle the logic to determine the shape. Specifically, it prints "TRIANGLE" if any row has exactly one '1', which is incorrect, and it prints "SQUARE" if any row has more than one '1', which is also incorrect.

To fix the program, you would need to implement logic that properly checks for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle and a square as described in the problem statement.
