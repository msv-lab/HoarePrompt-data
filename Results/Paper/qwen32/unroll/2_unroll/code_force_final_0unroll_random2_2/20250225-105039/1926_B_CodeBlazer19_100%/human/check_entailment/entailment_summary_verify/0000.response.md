### Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle Shapes**:
    - The program checks if any row has exactly one '1'. If it finds such a row, it immediately concludes that the shape is a triangle. However, a triangle can have rows with varying numbers of '1's, not just one row with a single '1'. For example, a triangle with \(k=3\) would have rows with 1, 3, and 5 '1's respectively. The current logic would incorrectly identify this as a triangle based on the row with a single '1'.
    - Furthermore, the program does not account for upside-down triangles, which are also valid triangles.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Square Shapes**:
    - The program checks if any row has more than one '1'. If it finds such a row, it concludes that the shape is a square. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. A square requires that all rows have the same number of '1's, and these '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. The current logic does not check these conditions.

3. **Edge Cases Not Considered**:
    - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle. It only checks for triangles that are oriented with their base at the bottom.
    - The program does not correctly handle cases where the shape is a square. It only checks if a row has more than one '1', which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square.

### Example Input:
The provided example input demonstrates the incorrectness of the program:

**Input:**
```
1
5
00111
00010
00000
00000
00000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

The program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because it finds a row with more than one '1'. However, this shape is actually a triangle.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program. The program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle due to the reasons outlined above.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
