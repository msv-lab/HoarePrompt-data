### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several critical flaws in the provided program. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Triangle Detection**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that any row with exactly one '1' indicates a triangle. However, a triangle can have multiple '1's in its rows, specifically `2*i - 1` '1's in the i-th row.
   - The program does not check for the specific pattern of '1's that form a triangle, which involves progressively increasing or decreasing numbers of '1's centered in a column.

2. **Square Detection**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that any row with more than one '1' indicates a square. However, a square requires each of the `k` rows to have exactly `k` '1's, and all rows must have the same number of '1's aligned in a square shape.
   - The program does not check for the specific pattern of '1's that form a square, which involves having exactly `k` '1's in each of `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly implement the rules for identifying either a triangle or a square. It relies on simplistic row-wise checks that do not capture the specific geometric patterns required.

### Evaluation of Annotations:
The annotations provided do not adequately address these issues. They merely state the program's behavior without challenging or validating the underlying logic. The annotations do not provide a systematic check to ensure that the program correctly identifies the shapes based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the reasoning provided in the original assessment, the program is indeed incorrect. It fails to correctly identify the shapes based on the given criteria.

**Final: False**
