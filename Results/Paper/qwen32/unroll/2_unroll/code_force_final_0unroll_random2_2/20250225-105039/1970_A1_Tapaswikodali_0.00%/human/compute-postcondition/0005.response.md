The code sorts the list `details`. Initially, `details` contains tuples of the form `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in the string `s`. After sorting, the list `details` will be ordered primarily by `balance`, then by `-i` (which means it will be ordered in descending order of the original index `i` for tuples with the same `balance`), and finally by `char`.

Since the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the `balance` will range from 0 to some positive number and back to 0 as the sequence progresses. Sorting by `balance` will group all tuples with the same balance value together. Sorting by `-i` within each balance group will maintain the reverse order of the original indices for characters with the same balance.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `balance` is 0, `details` is a sorted list of tuples (balance, -i, char) for each character in `s`, ordered by balance and then by descending original index `i` for tuples with the same balance.**
