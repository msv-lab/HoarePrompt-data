To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`s`**: A string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
2. **`balance`**: Initialized to 0. It is used to keep track of the balance of parentheses as we iterate through the string `s`.
3. **`details`**: A sorted list of tuples (balance, -i, char) for each character in `s`. The list is ordered by balance and then by descending original index `i` for tuples with the same balance.
4. **`result`**: Initialized to `s`. This variable holds the final result to be printed.

### Analysis:
- The variable `result` is directly assigned the value of `s`.
- The variable `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning that every opening parenthesis "(" has a corresponding closing parenthesis ")" in the correct order.
- Since `result` is set to `s`, the `print(result)` statement will output the string `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `result` is directly assigned the value of `s`, and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the string `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **s (where s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence)**
