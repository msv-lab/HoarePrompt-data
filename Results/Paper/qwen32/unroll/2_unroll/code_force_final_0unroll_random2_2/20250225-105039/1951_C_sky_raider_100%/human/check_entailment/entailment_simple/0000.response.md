Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by sorting the prices of the tickets and then purchasing tickets starting from the cheapest day. However, this greedy approach does not consider the constraint that purchasing tickets on a certain day increases the price for subsequent days. This means that the optimal strategy is not necessarily to buy tickets on the cheapest available days first, as doing so could lead to higher prices later on.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
4 2 8
8 6 4 2
```

The given code would sort the prices to `[2, 4, 6, 8]` and then attempt to buy tickets starting from the cheapest day. However, the optimal strategy would be to buy tickets on the days with higher prices first to minimize the increase in price for subsequent days.

The correct approach would involve a dynamic programming or binary search combined with a greedy strategy to determine the minimum cost. The given code does not account for the price increase mechanism, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
