Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The main issue is that it greedily buys the maximum number of tickets on the lowest-priced days without considering the future price increases caused by the tickets bought on those days. This can lead to a suboptimal solution where the total cost is higher than necessary.

To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated greedy strategy that takes into account the future price increases is needed. The current implementation does not account for the fact that buying tickets on a particular day will increase the prices on subsequent days, which can affect the optimal purchase strategy.

Here's a high-level outline of a correct approach:

1. Use a priority queue (or a similar data structure) to always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price.
2. Keep track of the number of tickets bought and the increased price for future days.
3. Ensure that the number of tickets bought each day does not exceed the allowed maximum and the total number of tickets required.

This approach ensures that the tickets are bought in a way that minimizes the total cost while adhering to the constraints.
