Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). The test case also includes a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the price per ticket for each of the n days, with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
