The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range function parameters `1` and `isqrt(x) + 1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `isqrt(x) + 1` is greater than `1`, which means `isqrt(x)` must be at least `1`. This is true for any `x` that is at least `1`.

Since `x` is already given to be in the range `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8`, `isqrt(x)` will always be at least `1` for these values of `x`. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once for the given constraints on `x`.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, since the task specifies to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to make any adjustments to `t`, `n`, or `ans`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `ans` is 0**
