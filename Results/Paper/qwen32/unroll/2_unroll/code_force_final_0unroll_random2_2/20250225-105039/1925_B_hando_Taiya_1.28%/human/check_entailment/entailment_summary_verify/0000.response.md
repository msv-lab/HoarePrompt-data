Let's carefully analyze the program and the provided function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
- **Objective**: Break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of their difficulties equals `x`.
- **Balance**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
- **Goal**: Find the maximum possible balance.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it finds and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Here's the program code for reference:

```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Function Summary
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it finds and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the logic with a few test cases and edge cases.

#### Test Case 1: Input
```
3
10 3
5 5
420 69
```
#### Expected Output:
```
2
1
6
```

#### Test Case 1: Analysis
- For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, one possible division is `4, 2, 4` (GCD = 2).
- For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only division is `1, 1, 1, 1, 1` (GCD = 1).
- For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, one possible division can be `6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6` (GCD = 6).

The program seems to correctly handle these cases.

### Edge Cases
1. **x = 1, n = 1**: The only division is `1` (GCD = 1).
2. **x = n**: The only division is `1, 1, ..., 1` (GCD = 1).
3. **x = k * n**: The division can be `k, k, ..., k` (GCD = k).

### Analysis of the Program Logic
The program iterates through possible divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
- If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `i`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `x // i`.

This logic ensures that the program finds the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties is maximized.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the problem description and edge cases. It finds the maximum balance by considering divisors of `x` up to its integer square root and checks if the number of sub-problems `n` can be accommodated with the current divisor or its corresponding quotient. This ensures that the balance is maximized.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
