You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or such that `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it finds and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of their difficulties equals `x`.
- **Balance**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
- **Goal**: Find the maximum possible balance.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through possible divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
- If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `i`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `x // i`.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the logic with a few test cases and edge cases.

#### Test Case 1: Input
```
3
10 3
5 5
420 69
```
#### Expected Output:
```
2
1
6
```

#### Test Case 1: Analysis
- For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, one possible division is `4, 2, 4` (GCD = 2).
- For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only division is `1, 1, 1, 1, 1` (GCD = 1).
- For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, one possible division can be `6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6` (GCD = 6).

The program seems to correctly handle these cases.

### Edge Cases
1. **x = 1, n = 1**: The only division is `1` (GCD = 1).
2. **x = n**: The only division is `1, 1, ..., 1` (GCD = 1).
3. **x = k * n**: The division can be `k, k, ..., k` (GCD = k).

### Conclusion
The program seems to correctly handle the problem description and edge cases. It finds the maximum balance by considering divisors of `x` up to its integer square root and checks if the number of sub-problems `n` can be accommodated.

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation
The program correctly iterates through the divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. It checks if `n` can be accommodated with the current divisor or its corresponding quotient and keeps track of the maximum possible GCD. This ensures that the balance is maximized.
