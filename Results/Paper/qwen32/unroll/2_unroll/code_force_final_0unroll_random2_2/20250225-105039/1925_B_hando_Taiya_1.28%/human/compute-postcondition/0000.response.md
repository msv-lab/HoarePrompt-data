The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8.**
