Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for constructing a progressive square based on the given rules. Specifically, the program assumes that the smallest element in the list is `a_{1,1}`, which is not necessarily true. The value of `a_{1,1}` should be derived from the given values of `c` and `d` and the provided list of integers.

The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the smallest element in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}`. This assumption can lead to incorrect results because `a_{1,1}` could be any value that, when used to construct the progressive square with the given `c` and `d`, results in the same set of elements as the provided list `l`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the value of `a_{1,1}` such that the constructed progressive square matches the provided list `l`. The current implementation does not account for this and can therefore produce incorrect results.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 3
4 7 10 5 8 11 6 9 12
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the program incorrectly determines that the elements do not match because it assumes `a_{1,1}` is 4, which is not the correct value. The correct value for `a_{1,1}` in this case would be 1, leading to the correct progressive square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
