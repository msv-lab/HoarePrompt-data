You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if a given list `l` of `n^2` integers can be rearranged to match a specific sequence generated by starting from the minimum value in `l` and incrementing by `c` and `d` in a grid-like fashion. It returns 'yes' if the list can be rearranged to match this sequence, otherwise it returns 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Understanding the Problem

The problem involves constructing a progressive square of size \( n \times n \) using the parameters \( a_{1,1} \), \( c \), and \( d \). The construction rules are:
- The top-left element is \( a_{1,1} \).
- The element at position \( (i, j) \) in the matrix is given by the formula: \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

The task is to determine if a given list of \( n^2 \) integers can be rearranged to form such a progressive square for the given \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).

### Analyzing the Program

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case:
   - It reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - It reads the list of \( n^2 \) integers \( l \).
   - It calls the function `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to check if the list can form a progressive square.
3. The function `func_1`:
   - Determines the smallest element \( a \) in the list \( l \), which is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
   - Constructs a new list \( li \) with the expected values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \).
   - Sorts both the provided list \( l \) and the constructed list \( li \).
   - Compares the sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Verification

- The program correctly identifies the smallest element \( a \) in the list \( l \) as \( a_{1,1} \).
- It constructs the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
- It sorts both lists and compares them to check if they match, which ensures that the provided list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list can form a progressive square according to the provided rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
