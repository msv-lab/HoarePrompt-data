Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1'. The character '0' indicates that the resident of the corresponding house wants to live on the left side of the street, and '1' indicates they want to live on the right side. The function returns the number of houses that want to live on the left side for each test case.**
