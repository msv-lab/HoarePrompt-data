In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop body is omitted, so we only need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the variables in the loop head. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 because the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range, and it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4**
