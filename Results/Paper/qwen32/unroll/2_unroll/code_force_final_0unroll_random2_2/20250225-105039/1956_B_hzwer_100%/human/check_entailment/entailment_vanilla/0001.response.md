Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each card has an integer from `1` to `n` on it, and each integer appears exactly twice. The players take turns placing cards on the table, and a player earns a point if the card they place matches an integer already on the table.

The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can earn if you play optimally, assuming Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Key Observations

1. **Pairing Cards**: Each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice. Therefore, there are `n` pairs of cards.
2. **Point Scoring**: A player earns a point if they place a card that matches an integer already on the table.
3. **Optimal Play**: Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, for the purpose of calculating your maximum possible score, we only need to consider how you can maximize your points.

### Strategy to Maximize Points

To maximize your points, you should aim to place cards that match integers already on the table as often as possible. The optimal strategy involves:

- Counting the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
- If you have a pair of the same integer, you can place one card, and if Nene doesn't have a matching card, you can place the second card later to score a point.
- If you have a single card of a certain integer, you can only score a point if Nene places a matching card before you do.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows this logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
2. **Counting Cards**: It uses a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
3. **Calculating Points**: For each integer, it calculates the maximum number of points you can earn by placing cards that match integers already on the table. Specifically, for each integer `x` with `cnt[x]` occurrences, you can score `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` points. This is because if you have `cnt[x]` cards of integer `x`, you can place `cnt[x] - 1` of them after Nene has placed the first one, earning `cnt[x] - 1` points.
4. **Output**: It prints the total number of points for each test case.

### Correctness

The program correctly implements the strategy to calculate the maximum number of points you can earn. It counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand and calculates the points based on the logic described above. The program handles multiple test cases efficiently and adheres to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

The program is correct based on the problem description and the logic used to calculate the maximum number of points.

**Correctness: True**
