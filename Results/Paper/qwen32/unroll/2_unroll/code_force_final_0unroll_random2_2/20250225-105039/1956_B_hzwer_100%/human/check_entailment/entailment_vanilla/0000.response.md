To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Setup:**
   - There are `2n` cards, with each integer from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice.
   - Cards are distributed between two players, each receiving `n` cards.
   - Players take turns placing one card each on the table.
   - If the card being placed matches a card already on the table, the player scores a point.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum score you can achieve assuming optimal play by Nene.

### Key Observations:

- **Optimal Play:** Since Nene plays optimally, she will always place a card that either:
  - Maximizes her score.
  - Minimizes your score if maximizing her score results in ties between moves.
  
- **Your Strategy:** To maximize your score, you should aim to place cards that match cards already on the table as often as possible.
  
- **Counting Pairs:**
  - If you have more than one of a certain number, you can score points by placing the second card of that number after it has been placed on the table by either player.
  - For each number that appears twice in your hand, you can score at most 1 point (since the first card will not score a point, but the second card will if the first card is already on the table).

### Program Analysis:

The provided program calculates the maximum score you can achieve by counting how many numbers appear more than once in your hand. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each number in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each number.

3. **Calculating Score:**
   - It calculates the score by summing up `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`.
   - `max(0, x - 1)` effectively counts the number of pairs for each number, as you can score a point for each pair after the first card is placed.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the calculated score for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum score you can achieve by counting the number of pairs in your hand. Since Nene plays optimally, the best you can do is to maximize the number of pairs you can form and score points from, which is precisely what the program does.

**Correctness: True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the optimal strategy described.
