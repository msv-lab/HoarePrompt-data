The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `input()` must provide a positive integer value.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will iterate `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The variable `_` does not need any specific state adjustment since it is not used in the loop body.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `input()` provides a value that makes `int(input())` at least 1.

State: **`input()` must provide a value such that `int(input())` is at least 1**
