Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 26` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 26`; `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'.**

Explanation: The value of `s` has been updated to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are still integers read from standard input within the specified range.
