Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from given sticks. However, there is a discrepancy between the problem description and the implementation of the function `func_1`.

The problem requires forming regular polygons with equal-sided sides, which means for a polygon with `k` sides, we need `k` sticks of the same length. The smallest regular polygon is a triangle (`k=3`), but the function `func_1` only considers sets of four sticks (`k=4`), which is incorrect.

The function `func_1` calculates the total number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 and summing the results. However, the problem does not specify that only squares should be considered; it allows for polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider all possible regular polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) and determine the optimal combination. The current implementation does not account for this requirement and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
