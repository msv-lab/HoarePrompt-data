To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy.

Given:
- `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the number of test cases.

The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

### Analysis:
- If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute.
- If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute.

### Adjustment:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0**
