Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, h and w are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9. x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w. It is guaranteed that x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
