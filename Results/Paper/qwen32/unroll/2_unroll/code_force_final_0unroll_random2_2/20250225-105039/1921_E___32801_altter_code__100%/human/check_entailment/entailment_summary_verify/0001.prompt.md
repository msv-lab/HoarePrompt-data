You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input values representing dimensions and coordinates, evaluates the conditions based on these values, and prints either 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw' based on the specified rules. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Game Rules**: Alice and Bob take turns moving their chips. Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left.
2. **Winning Condition**: The player who places their chip on the cell occupied by the other player's chip wins.
3. **Draw Condition**: If a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw.
4. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program seems to be trying to determine the winner based on the initial positions of the chips and the rules of the game. However, there are several issues in the logic and implementation that need to be addressed.

#### Key Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Draw Condition**:
   - The program incorrectly checks for the draw condition. For instance, it prints 'draw' if `x2 <= x1` without considering whether either player can still make a move.
   
2. **Incorrect Movement Logic**:
   - The program attempts to simulate movements but does not correctly account for the constraints of the board or the optimal strategies of the players.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the positions after potential movements is flawed.

3. **Inefficient and Complex Logic**:
   - The program includes a lot of unnecessary and complex logic that does not accurately reflect the optimal strategies of the players.
   - The use of variables like `a`, `b`, `t`, and `c` without clear explanations makes the code hard to follow and verify.

4. **Inconsistent Output**:
   - The program does not consistently output the correct result for all test cases. For example, it might output 'Alice' when the game should end in a draw.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all possible scenarios. The logic for simulating the game and determining the winner is flawed, and the program does not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
