Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. The logic in the program involves counting the occurrences of each card in your hand and then dividing by 3, but this approach does not align with the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the strategy for both players:

1. **You want to maximize your points.** You should try to play cards that will give you points (i.e., cards that already have a matching card on the table).
2. **Nene wants to minimize your points and maximize her points.** She will play optimally to counter your strategy.

The correct approach involves using a greedy strategy with a priority queue or similar data structure to keep track of the best moves for both players.

The provided program simply counts the occurrences of each card and divides by 3, which does not account for the dynamic nature of the game where the state of the table changes with each move.

For example, in the first test case, the correct output is 1, but the provided program will likely output a different result because it does not simulate the game turns and does not account for Nene's optimal play.

Correctness: **False**
