Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, and the function determines if the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) is at least twice the number of elements in that range. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly; it outputs the result of each query directly.**
