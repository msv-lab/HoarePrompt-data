Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of subarrays of a palindrome array `a`, `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000, `a` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `0`, `prev` is `0`, `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**

In the output state, the variable `idx` is calculated to be `(n - 1) // 2`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
