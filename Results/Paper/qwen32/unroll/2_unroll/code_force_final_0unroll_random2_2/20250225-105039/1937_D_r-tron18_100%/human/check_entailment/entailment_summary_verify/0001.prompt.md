You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

    n = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]

#Function 2:

    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))

                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, along with its length `n`, and calculates a list `ans` of values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The final output is the list `ans`, which is printed. The function does not modify the input string `s1` or the integer `n`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a combination of prefix sums and suffix sums, but it does not correctly simulate the pinball movement and the inversion of the grid cells as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the current cell.
   - After moving, the character in the cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - Each test case involves a grid and multiple queries, where each query starts the pinball in a different cell.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` seems to calculate a difference based on accumulated values.
   - `func_2` processes the string `s1` to compute the number of seconds for each starting position.
   - The program uses prefix sums (`preOne`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to calculate the answer for each position, but these accumulations do not correctly reflect the pinball's movement and the inversion of the grid cells.

3. **Key Issues:**
   - The program does not simulate the pinball's movement step by step.
   - The inversion of the grid cells is not accounted for in the calculations.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each query, the pinball's movement should be simulated step by step.
   - The grid should be updated (inverted) after each move.
   - The simulation should continue until the pinball leaves the grid.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
