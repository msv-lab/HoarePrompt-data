arr is a list of strings where each string consists of characters '<' and '>', and times is a list of integers representing the lengths of the strings in arr, such that the length of arr is equal to the length of times, and each element in times is a positive integer (1 ≤ times[i] ≤ 5 * 10^5), and the sum of all elements in times does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
