Precondition: **The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5), where n is the number of problems in the bank and m is the number of upcoming rounds. It also receives a string a of length n, consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.**
