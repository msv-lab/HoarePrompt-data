To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the functions `func_2()` and `func_3()`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` and `k` are obtained from `func_3()`.
   - `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
   - `v` is either `n` or the value of `i` where `func_2()` returned `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
   - For each iteration, `cnt` is initialized to `k` and `l` to `1`.
   - The inner `while` loop runs as long as `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`.
   - Inside the `while` loop, a query is printed with `l` and `i * v`.
   - The value of `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.
   - `cnt` is decremented by 1.
   - If `cnt` reaches zero and `l` equals `n + 1`, the program prints `! {i * v}` and calls `func_2()` before returning.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when all iterations are completed or when the `return` statement is executed inside the loop.

Given that the loop can terminate either by completing all iterations or by returning early, we need to consider both scenarios:

- If the loop completes all iterations without returning early, the final values of `i`, `cnt`, and `l` will be determined by the last iteration.
- If the loop returns early, the final values of `i`, `cnt`, and `l` will be those at the point of the return.

For the final output state, we assume the loop completes all iterations without returning early, as the problem does not specify an early termination condition other than the given criteria.

**Final Values**:
- `i` will be `n // k + 1` (the value after the last iteration).
- `cnt` will be `0` (since it is decremented until it reaches zero in each iteration).
- `l` will be `n + 1` or some value less than `n + 1` depending on the last iteration.
- `n`, `k`, and `v` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `k` being between 1 and `n` (inclusive); `v` is `n` or the value of `i` where `func_2()` returned `n`; `i` is `n // k + 1`; `cnt` is `0`; `l` is a value between `1` and `n + 1`.**
