To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of `func_2()`. However, since the implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we will assume it modifies the variable `v` based on the return value of `n` from `func_3()` and possibly other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `k` being between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
- `v` is `n` or the value of `i` where `func_2()` returned `n`.
- `i` is `n // k + 1`.
- `cnt` is `0`.
- `l` is a value between `1` and `n + 1`.

After executing `func_2()`, the only variable that could change is `v`. Since the exact behavior of `func_2()` is not specified, we can only infer that `v` could be updated based on the logic within `func_2()`. However, we can assume that `v` might be set to `n` or some other value derived from `n` or `i`.

Given the lack of specific details about `func_2()`, we will assume that `func_2()` does not modify `n`, `k`, `i`, `cnt`, or `l`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `k` being between 1 and `n` (inclusive); `v` is updated based on the logic in `func_2()`; `i` is `n // k + 1`; `cnt` is `0`; `l` is a value between `1` and `n + 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after running `func_2()`, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `cnt`, and `l` remain the same as in the initial state, but `v` could have been updated based on the logic within `func_2()`.
