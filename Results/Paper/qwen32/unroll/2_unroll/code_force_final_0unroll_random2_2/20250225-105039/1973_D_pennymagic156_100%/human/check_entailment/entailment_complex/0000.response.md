### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray satisfies the condition `f(l, r) = m`. Here, `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a[l]...a[r])`.

The provided program consists of several functions that interact to solve this problem. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads a line of input and returns it as a list of integers.
   - This function is not used in `func_5`, so it can be ignored for this particular problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads a line of input and returns it as an integer.
   - This function is used to read the response from the query.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Reads a line of input and returns a map object that yields integers.
   - This function is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - Reads a line of input and returns it as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - This function is not used in `func_5`, so it can be ignored for this particular problem.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function is the main function that solves the problem for each test case.
   - **Step 1**: It first tries to find the largest possible value `v` such that `f(1, n) = v * n`. It does this by querying `f(1, i * n)` for `i` from `n` down to `1`. If the response is `n`, it means `f(1, n) = i * n`, and it breaks the loop with `v = i`.

   - **Step 2**: It then tries to verify if the array can be split into `k` subarrays each with `f(l, r) = i * v`. It does this by querying `f(l, i * v)` for `l` starting from `1` and incrementing by `1` after each query. If the response is `n + 1`, it means no such `r` exists, and it breaks the loop. If it successfully queries `k` times and the last response is `n + 1`, it prints `i * v` as the answer.

   - **Step 3**: If it fails to find a valid split, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis:

- The first loop in `func_5` is intended to find the maximum possible value of `m` that could be the answer by checking possible multiples of `n` from `n * n` down to `n`. However, this approach is not guaranteed to find the correct `m` because it assumes `m` is a multiple of `n`, which might not be the case.

- The second loop is intended to verify if the array can be split into `k` subarrays each with `f(l, r) = i * v`. However, the approach of incrementing `l` by `1` after each query is not efficient and might not correctly identify the subarrays.

- The logic of the program is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where `m` is not a multiple of `n` and does not efficiently verify the subarray splits.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
