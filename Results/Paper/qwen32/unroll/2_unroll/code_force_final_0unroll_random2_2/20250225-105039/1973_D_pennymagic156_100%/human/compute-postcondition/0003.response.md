To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes 1.
2. In each iteration, the code prints `? 1 {i * n}` and then updates `v` with the value returned by `func_2()`.
3. If `v` equals `n`, `v` is set to `i` and the loop is terminated using `break`.

The loop will iterate until either `v` equals `n` or `i` reaches 1. 

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are returned by `func_3()`, and `v` is initially 1. The value of `v` will change based on the return value of `func_2()` in each iteration. If `func_2()` returns `n` in any iteration, `v` will be set to the current value of `i` and the loop will terminate. Otherwise, the loop will continue until `i` reaches 1.

The final state of `v` depends on the return values of `func_2()`. If `func_2()` never returns `n`, `v` will remain `n` after the loop completes because the loop will iterate down to `i = 1` and the final value of `v` will be `n`.

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `k` being between 1 and `n` (inclusive); `v` is `n` or the value of `i` where `func_2()` returned `n`.**
