To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `n`, and the loop's range parameters.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because the range function in Python will generate a sequence starting from `n` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time.

The variables `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive). However, for the loop to execute, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

The variable `v` is initialized to 1, but since it is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step by Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the range function and does not need to be set before the loop starts.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
3. **Variable `k`**: This variable is not part of the loop head and its value does not affect the execution of the loop directly.
4. **Variable `v`**: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `k` and `v` do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `v` is 1**
