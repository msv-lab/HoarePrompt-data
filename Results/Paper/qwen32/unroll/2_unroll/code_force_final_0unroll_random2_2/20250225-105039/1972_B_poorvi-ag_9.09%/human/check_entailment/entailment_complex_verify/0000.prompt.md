You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:

    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: results
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: results
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of coins `n` is odd and if the count of "U" in the string exceeds the count of "D". If both conditions are met, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - There are `n` coins in a circle.
   - Each coin is either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D").
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first.
   - A player chooses a facing-up coin, removes it, and flips the two adjacent coins.
   - If only two coins remain, removing one does not flip the other.
   - If only one coin remains, no coins are flipped.
   - If no facing-up coins remain, the player loses.
   - The player who forces the other to lose wins.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine who will win if both play optimally.

3. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases, each with:
     - An integer `n` representing the number of coins.
     - A string `s` of length `n` representing the state of each coin.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print "YES" if Alice wins, "NO" if Bob wins.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
- Checks if the number of coins `n` is even.
  - If `n` is even, it appends "no" to the results list.
- If `n` is odd, it checks if the count of "U" (facing-up coins) is greater than the count of "D" (facing-down coins).
  - If the count of "U" is greater, it appends "yes" to the results list.
  - Otherwise, it appends "no" to the results list.

### Evaluation:
The provided program does not fully capture the game's complexities and rules. Here are some potential issues:

1. **Even Number of Coins (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - The program assumes that if `n` is even, Bob will always win. This is not necessarily true. The game's outcome depends on the distribution of "U" and "D" coins, not just the parity of `n`.

2. **Odd Number of Coins (`n % 2 != 0`)**:
   - The program checks if the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins. This is also an oversimplification. The optimal strategy involves more than just the count of "U" and "D" coins.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
UUU
```
- According to the program, since `n` is odd and there are more "U" coins than "D" coins, the output would be "YES".
- However, let's analyze the game:
  - Alice can choose any "U" coin. Suppose she chooses the first one. The coins become "DDU".
  - Bob can then choose the last "U". The coins become "DD".
  - Alice can choose one of the "D" coins, but since there are no "U" coins left, Bob wins.
- Therefore, the correct output should be "NO".

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules and optimal play. It oversimplifies the problem by only considering the parity of `n` and the count of "U" and "D" coins.

Correctness: **False**.
