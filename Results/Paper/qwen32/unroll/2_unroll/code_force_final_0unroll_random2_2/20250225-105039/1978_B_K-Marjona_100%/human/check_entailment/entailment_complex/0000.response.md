### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling his buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. Each test case consists of three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Determine `k`**: For each test case, the program calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between `b` and `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the promotion does not offer any benefit, so the maximum profit is simply `a * n` (selling all buns at the usual price).
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit by selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price. The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = b \cdot k - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - Here, `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices (which form an arithmetic sequence), and `(n - k) * a` calculates the revenue from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the calculated profit.

### Verification with Examples:

- **First Test Case**: For `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`:
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = min(4, 1) = 1`
  - Since `b > a`, use the formula: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 0 + 12 = 17`
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Second Test Case**: For `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = min(5, 4) = 4`
  - Since `b > a`, use the formula: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Third Test Case**: For `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`:
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = min(10, -5) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, use the formula: `10 * 10 = 100`
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Fourth Test Case**: For `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = min(5, 6) = 5`
  - Since `b > a`, use the formula: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Remaining Test Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge cases and large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as demonstrated by the provided outputs.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling his buns under the given promotion rules.
