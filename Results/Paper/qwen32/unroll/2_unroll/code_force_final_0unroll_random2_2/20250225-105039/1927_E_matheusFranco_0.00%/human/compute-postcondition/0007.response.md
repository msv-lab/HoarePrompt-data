To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `permutation` list is filled in a specific pattern where each `i`th value of `curr_v` starts filling from the `i`-th position and fills every `k`-th position thereafter.
- `idx` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `idx_v` remains 1 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `curr_v` will be `n + 1` after the loop as it is incremented `n` times.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
```

This code snippet converts each element of the `permutation` list to a string and then joins them with a space to form a single string `result`.

Since `permutation` is already described in the initial state, the only variable that changes is `result`. The values of `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`permutation` list is filled in a specific pattern where each `i`th value of `curr_v` starts filling from the `i`-th position and fills every `k`-th position thereafter; `idx` remains 0; `idx_v` remains 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `permutation` list retains its specific pattern.
- `idx` remains 0.
- `idx_v` remains 1.
- `curr_v` becomes `n + 1`.
- `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `permutation` with spaces.
