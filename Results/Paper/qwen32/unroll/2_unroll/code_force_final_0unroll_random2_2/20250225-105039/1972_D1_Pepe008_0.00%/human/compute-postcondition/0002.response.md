To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the code and understand what it does.

The given code snippet is a loop that runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers, `a` and `b`. It then calculates a sum based on these integers and prints the result.

Here is the loop in question:

```python
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
            suma += x
    print(suma - 1)
```

### Explanation of the Inner Loop:

1. **Initialization**: `suma` is initialized to 0.
2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - It checks if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. If true, it adds `x` to `suma`.
3. **Output**: After the inner loop finishes, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Output State:

After all iterations of the outer loop (i.e., after processing all `T` test cases), the state of the variables will be as follows:

- `T`: The number of test cases will remain unchanged.
- `t`: This variable is a loop variable and will not retain any specific value after the loop ends; it will simply be the last value it took during the loop, which is `T-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `T-1`).
- `a` and `b`: These variables will retain the values from the last test case processed by the loop.
- `suma`: This variable will retain the value from the last iteration of the outer loop, which is the sum calculated for the last test case.
- `i`: This variable will retain the last value it took in the inner loop of the last test case, which is `b`.
- `x`: This variable will retain the last value it took in the inner loop of the last test case.

However, since we are asked to describe the output state in terms of the printed output, the output state will consist of `T` printed results, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Given the format requested, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The output state consists of `T` printed integers, each representing the result of the calculation `suma - 1` for each test case.**
