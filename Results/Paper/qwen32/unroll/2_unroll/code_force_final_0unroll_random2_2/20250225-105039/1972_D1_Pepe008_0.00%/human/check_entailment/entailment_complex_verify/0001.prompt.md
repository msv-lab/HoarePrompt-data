You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:

        print(suma - 1)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `T` printed integers, each representing the result of the calculation `suma - 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific integer value for each test case based on the formula derived from the input values `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Condition Analysis

Given the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\), let's simplify it:
- Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
- The condition becomes \(d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ d \cdot b')\).
- Simplifying, we get \(a' + b' \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ b')\), which means \(a' \equiv -b' \ (\text{mod} \ b')\).
- Since \(a'\) and \(b'\) are coprime, the only solution for this is \(a' = k \cdot b' - b'\) for some integer \(k\), but since \(a'\) and \(b'\) are positive and coprime, the only feasible solution is \(a' = b'\).
- Therefore, \(a = b \cdot d\).

### Simplified Problem

The problem simplifies to finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\). So, for each \(b\), \(a\) can be any multiple of \(b\) up to \(n\).

### Correct Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):  # This should be m instead of b
            x = (n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if n - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)  # This subtraction is incorrect

func()
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Variable Name Error**: The loop should iterate over `m` instead of `b`.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula `(n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not correct for counting multiples of `i` up to `n`.
3. **Incorrect Result Adjustment**: The final result is adjusted by subtracting 1, which is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would be:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            suma += n // b
        print(suma)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to the above issues. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
