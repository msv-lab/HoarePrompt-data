Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Condition Analysis

Given the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\), let's simplify it:
- Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
- The condition becomes \(d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ d \cdot b')\).
- Simplifying, we get \(a' + b' \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ b')\), which means \(a' \equiv -b' \ (\text{mod} \ b')\).
- Since \(a'\) and \(b'\) are coprime, the only solution for this is \(a' = k \cdot b' - b'\) for some integer \(k\), but since \(a'\) and \(b'\) are positive and coprime, the only feasible solution is \(a' = b'\).
- Therefore, \(a = b \cdot d\).

### Simplified Problem

The problem simplifies to finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\). So, for each \(b\), \(a\) can be any multiple of \(b\) up to \(n\).

### Correct Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):  # This should be m instead of b
            x = (n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if n - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)  # This subtraction is incorrect

func()
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Variable Name Error**: The loop should iterate over `m` instead of `b`.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula `(n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not correct for counting multiples of `i` up to `n`.
3. **Incorrect Result Adjustment**: The final result is adjusted by subtracting 1, which is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would be:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            suma += n // b
        print(suma)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to the above issues. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
