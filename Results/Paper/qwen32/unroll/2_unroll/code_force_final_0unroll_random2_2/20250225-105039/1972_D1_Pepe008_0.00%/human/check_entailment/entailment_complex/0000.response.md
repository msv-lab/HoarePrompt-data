### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each test case. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates the number of valid pairs using a specific formula derived from the input values.

The commented-out section of the code indicates a brute-force approach that checks all possible pairs (i, j) to see if they satisfy the condition. However, this approach is not efficient given the constraints (up to 10^4 test cases with `a, b` up to 2 * 10^6).

The actual implementation uses a more efficient approach to calculate the number of valid pairs. It iterates over possible values of `i` (up to `b`) and calculates the number of valid `a` values for each `i` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The result is accumulated in `suma`, and then `suma - 1` is printed for each test case.

The formula used in the program seems to be derived based on the mathematical properties of the problem, but without a detailed derivation, we can verify its correctness based on the provided test cases and their expected outputs.

Given the outputs for the provided test cases match the expected results, it suggests that the formula and the implementation are correct.

### Correctness: **True**
