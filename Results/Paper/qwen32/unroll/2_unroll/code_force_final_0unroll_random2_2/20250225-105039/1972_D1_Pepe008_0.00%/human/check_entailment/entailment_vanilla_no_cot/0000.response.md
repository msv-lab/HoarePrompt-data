Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the loop and the formula used to calculate `suma` do not accurately count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not being correctly applied in the provided code. The nested loops commented out at the beginning of the function seem to attempt to check this condition, but the final implementation does not follow this logic.

Here is a brief explanation of why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the logic around it do not correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each test case.
- The subtraction of 1 at the end of the `suma` calculation is not justified and can lead to incorrect results, especially for smaller values of `n` and `m`.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Given the constraints, an optimized approach might be necessary to handle up to 10^4 test cases efficiently.
