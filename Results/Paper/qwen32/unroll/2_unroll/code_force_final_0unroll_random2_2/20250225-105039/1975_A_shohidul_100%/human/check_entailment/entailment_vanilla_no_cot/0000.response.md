Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operation. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping is flawed.

The program checks if the array is already sorted. If not, it checks if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is greater than or equal to the second part's first element and the second part is sorted. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. The program will check if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is greater than or equal to the second part's first element and the second part is sorted. However, the correct way to determine if the array can be sorted is to check if there exists an index `i` such that the array can be split into `a[0:i]` and `a[i:n]` and the concatenation `a[i:n] + a[0:i]` is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Check if the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenation is sorted
        for i in range(n):
            if all(a[j] <= a[j + 1] for j in range(i, n - 1)) and all(a[j] <= a[j + 1] for j in range(i)):
                if i == 0 or a[i - 1] <= a[i]:
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version of the program correctly checks all possible splits of the array to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.
