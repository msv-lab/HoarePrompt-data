You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It checks if the list is non-decreasing or if it can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element. For each test case, it outputs "YES" if the list meets the criteria and "NO" otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these two parts. This operation can be performed any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The program starts by reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

The program then checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension that checks if each element is less than or equal to the next one (`a[i - 1] <= a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`). If the array is already sorted, it prints "YES" and moves to the next test case.

If the array is not sorted, the program attempts to find a valid split point where the array can be split into a prefix and a suffix such that:
1. The first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix (`a[0] >= new[i]` for all `i` in the suffix).
2. The suffix itself is sorted in non-decreasing order (`new[i - 1] <= new[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `len(new)-1`).

If such a split point is found, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Split Points**: The program only checks the first split point where `a[i - 1] > a[i]` and then breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because there might be other valid split points further in the array.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Suffix**: The program checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix. This is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix. Instead, we need to ensure that the maximum element in the prefix is less than or equal to the minimum element in the suffix.
3. **Output for Non-Sorted Arrays**: The program incorrectly prints "NO" as soon as it finds a split point that doesn't work. It should continue checking other split points.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
