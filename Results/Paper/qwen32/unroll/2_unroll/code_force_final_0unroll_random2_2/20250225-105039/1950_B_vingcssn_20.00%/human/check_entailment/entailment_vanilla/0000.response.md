Reasoning: 
The given program attempts to solve the problem by explicitly printing the checkerboard for the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, this approach is not scalable or correct for all values of `n` within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The program does not handle cases where `n` is greater than 4, and instead, it prints a message "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish), which is not the expected output according to the problem statement. The program should generate a 2n x 2n checkerboard for any valid `n` within the range. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
