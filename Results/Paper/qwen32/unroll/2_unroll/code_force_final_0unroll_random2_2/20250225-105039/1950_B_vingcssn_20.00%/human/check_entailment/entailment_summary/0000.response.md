Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to handle test cases where the value of `n` ranges from 1 to 4. For each value of `n` within this range, the program prints a predefined pattern of a 2n x 2n checkerboard. However, the problem description specifies that `n` can range from 1 to 20. The program does not handle cases where `n` is greater than 4, which is a violation of the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not account for all possible valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
