Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 1000). For each of the `t` test cases, it accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. The function returns a value for each test case based on the string `s`.**
