### Reasoning:

1. **Single Character Strings**: If the string `s` has a length of 1, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program correctly identifies this case and prints "NO".

2. **Uniform Strings**: If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (i.e., all characters in `s` are identical), it is also impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program correctly identifies this case using `len(set(s)) == 1` and prints "NO".

3. **Other Strings**: For strings that are neither single characters nor uniform, the program attempts to rearrange the string by using `random.sample(s, len(s))` to shuffle the characters. If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it falls back to a simple rotation (`s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that `s2` is different from `s`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that a valid rearrangement is provided when possible. It also correctly identifies and reports when rearrangement is impossible. The use of `random.sample` ensures a random rearrangement, and the fallback mechanism ensures that the rearrangement is different from the original string.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
