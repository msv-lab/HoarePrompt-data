You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. For each string, it checks if the string is of length 1 or if all characters in the string are the same. If either condition is true, it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a modified version of the string `s`. The modification involves shuffling the string; if the shuffled string is the same as the original, it rotates the string by moving the first character to the end.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the string `s`.
3. It checks if the length of `s` is 1. If so, it prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
4. It then checks if all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., the length of the set of characters is 1 and the length of `s` is greater than 1). If so, it prints "No" because rearranging a string of identical characters will always result in the same string.
5. If neither of the above conditions is met, it attempts to rearrange the string by using `random.sample` to shuffle the characters.
6. If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it manually rearranges `s` by moving the first character to the end.
7. Finally, it prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

The program correctly handles the two impossible cases (single character string and a string with all identical characters) by printing "No". For other cases, it attempts to rearrange the string and ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string.

However, there is a minor issue with the output format for "No". The problem description specifies that "NO" should be printed in any case, but the program prints "No" with a lowercase 'n'. This does not affect the correctness of the logic but does not strictly adhere to the problem's output format requirements.

Given the flexibility mentioned in the problem description regarding the case of "YES" and "NO", we can consider the program correct in terms of logic.
