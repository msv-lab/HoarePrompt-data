Functionality: **The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It processes predefined lists and variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`) to determine the maximum profit. It handles the items based on their negative prices and bonuses, and returns the `max_profit` after processing.**
