### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and ensure it aligns with the problem description and the given execution summaries.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads a single integer, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of integers, which is used for reading `n`, `k`, prices for Alice (`a_i`), and prices for Bob (`b_i`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The main logic is in `func_4()`.
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k`.
   - It reads `a_i` and `b_i` and converts `a_i` to negative values (`neg_prices`), as we'll use a min-heap to simulate a max-heap.

3. **Sorting and Selection**:
   - The items are combined and sorted based on `b_i` (bonuses).
   - The first `k` items are pushed into a heap (which is a min-heap, but we are using negative prices to simulate a max-heap).
   - The remaining items are stored in `remaining_items`.

4. **Calculating Profit**:
   - `func_3()` calculates the initial profit by summing up the bonuses of the items in the heap and the items in `remaining_items` where the sum of `a_i` and `b_i` is non-negative.
   - The program then iteratively processes each remaining item:
     - If adding the current item improves the profit, it adjusts the profit accordingly.
     - It also ensures that the heap maintains the k best items based on `b_i`.
     - The profit is updated by considering the removal of the least beneficial item from the heap and adding the current item.

5. **Output**:
   - The maximum profit for each test case is printed.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case based on the problem's requirements. It ensures that Alice maximizes her profit by selecting the best items and considering Bob's optimal strategy of taking the k best items for free. The use of a heap allows the program to efficiently manage the selection of items and maintain the top k items based on Bob's bonuses.

Thus, the program is correct as it aligns with the problem description and the execution summaries.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
