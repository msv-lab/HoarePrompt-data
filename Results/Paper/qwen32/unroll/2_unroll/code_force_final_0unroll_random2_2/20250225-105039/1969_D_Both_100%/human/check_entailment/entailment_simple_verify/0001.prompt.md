You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \sum_{i \in S} b_i - \sum_{j \in T} a_j \]
where:
- \( S \) is the set of items Bob buys from Alice.
- \( T \) is the set of items Alice buys from the shop.

Bob can take up to \( k \) items for free from Alice's subset. Alice's strategy should be to maximize her profit, while Bob's strategy should be to minimize Alice's profit.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of items \( n \) and the number of free items \( k \).
2. Reads the prices for Alice \( a_i \) and Bob \( b_i \).
3. Combines these into tuples of \((-a_i, b_i)\) and sorts them by \( b_i \).
4. Uses a min-heap to manage the items and calculates the maximum profit by considering different subsets of items Alice can buy.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_1()` reads an integer.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of integers.
   - The main function `func_4()` reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads \( n \), \( k \), the prices for Alice, and the prices for Bob.

2. **Combining and Sorting**:
   - The items are combined into tuples \((-a_i, b_i)\) and sorted by \( b_i \). Sorting by \( b_i \) ensures that items with higher Bob's price are considered first, which is logical since Alice wants to maximize her profit.

3. **Heap Management**:
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the \( k \) items with the smallest \( -a_i \) (i.e., highest Alice's price). This is because Bob will take the \( k \) items with the smallest Alice's price for free.
   - The heap is initialized with the first \( k \) items from the sorted list.
   - The remaining items are processed one by one. For each item, the program calculates the current profit and updates the heap if the new item results in a higher profit.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The `func_3()` function calculates the initial profit by summing the Bob's prices of the remaining items and adding the profit from the items in the heap.
   - The main loop iterates over the remaining items, adjusting the heap and recalculating the profit to find the maximum possible profit.

### Correctness Verification
The logic of the program seems correct. The key points are:
- Sorting by \( b_i \) ensures that items with higher Bob's price are considered first.
- Using a min-heap to manage the \( k \) items with the smallest Alice's price ensures that Bob takes the most expensive items for Alice.
- The profit calculation and heap management are done correctly to find the maximum possible profit.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps taken by the program, it appears to be correct.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**
