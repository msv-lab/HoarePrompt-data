You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The number of test cases t is given at the beginning (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000).
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = input().split()
        
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        
        suma = 0
        
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: numCases remains unchanged, numInteger holds the value of n from the last test case, numbers is an empty list, and suma holds the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair for the last test case (but this value is printed and not stored for all test cases).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program aims to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases and, for each test case, reading the number of integers and the integers themselves. It then sorts the integers in ascending order and pairs them up by taking the first two numbers, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both from the list. This process is repeated until there are no more numbers left.

The key to maximizing the score is to always pair the smallest possible numbers together, as this ensures that the smaller number in each pair (which is added to the score) is as large as possible. By sorting the numbers in ascending order and then pairing them sequentially, the program effectively achieves this goal.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases, sorts the numbers, and calculates the score by summing the minimum of each pair. It also correctly removes the paired numbers from the list after each iteration.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
