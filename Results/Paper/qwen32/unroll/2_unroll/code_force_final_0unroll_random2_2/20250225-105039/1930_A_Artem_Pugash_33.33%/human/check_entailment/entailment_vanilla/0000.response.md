Reasoning:  
The given program aims to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases and, for each test case, reading the number of integers and the integers themselves. It then sorts the integers in ascending order and pairs them up by taking the first two numbers, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both from the list. This process is repeated until there are no more numbers left.

The key to maximizing the score is to always pair the smallest possible numbers together, as this ensures that the smaller number in each pair (which is added to the score) is as large as possible. By sorting the numbers in ascending order and then pairing them sequentially, the program effectively achieves this goal.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases, sorts the numbers, and calculates the score by summing the minimum of each pair. It also correctly removes the paired numbers from the list after each iteration.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
