The provided code snippet is:

```python
s = []
```

This code initializes an empty list `s`. The variable `sChar` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings, where each string `s` in `sChar` is a binary string (consisting only of '0's and '1's) with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `s` is an empty list.**
