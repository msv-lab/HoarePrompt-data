#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each i. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each i; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list of `n` integers selected from `a` based on `s`; `l` is equal to `r + 1`; `r` is equal to `l - 1`.

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed version of the list `ans` where each element at index `i` is the product of all elements in `b` from index `i` to the end of `b` in the original order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer, though not used in the function), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the characters in `s`. It then computes a list `ans` where each element is the product of a suffix of `b`. Finally, it returns the reversed version of `ans`.
