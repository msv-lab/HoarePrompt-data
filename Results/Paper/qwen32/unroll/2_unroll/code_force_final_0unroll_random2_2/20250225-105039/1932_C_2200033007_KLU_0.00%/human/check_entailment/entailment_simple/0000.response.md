### Reasoning:

Let's break down the annotated program and verify if it correctly implements the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a` of length `n`, and the string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process the commands.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - Depending on the command ('L' or 'R'), it appends either the leftmost or rightmost element of `a` to a list `b`.

3. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - The program then calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and computes the remainder when divided by `m`.
   - It stores these remainders in the list `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program returns the list `ans` in the correct order by reversing it before returning.

### Issues:

While the program seems to follow the steps correctly, there is a critical issue in the implementation:

- **Product Calculation:** The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and then computes the remainder. However, it should compute the remainder at each step before removing an element, not after processing all elements in `b`.

### Correct Implementation:

To fix the issue, the product and remainder should be calculated at each step before the element is removed from the array. Here's the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    p = 1  # Initialize product to 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            p = (p * a[l]) % m  # Compute remainder immediately
            ans.append(p)
            l += 1
        else:
            p = (p * a[r]) % m  # Compute remainder immediately
            ans.append(p)
            r -= 1
    
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect because it calculates the product and remainder in reverse order and not at each step as required by the problem statement.

### Your response:

Reasoning: The current implementation calculates the product and remainder in reverse order and not at each step as required by the problem statement.
Correctness: **False**
