The given code snippet only initializes an empty list `ans`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the output state will include the initial state of all variables except for `ans`, which will now be an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each i; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list of `n` integers selected from `a` based on `s`; `l` is equal to `r + 1`; `r` is equal to `l - 1`; `ans` is an empty list.**
