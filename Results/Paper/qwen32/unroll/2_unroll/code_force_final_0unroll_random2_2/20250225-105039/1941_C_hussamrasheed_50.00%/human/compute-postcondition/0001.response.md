In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 and will iterate until `i` is less than `t`. 

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variables `n` and `s` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to make the loop execute. They are used within the loop body, which is not provided.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, we only need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Since `t` is already defined to be at least 1 according to the problem statement, no adjustment is necessary for `t` to make the loop execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters**
