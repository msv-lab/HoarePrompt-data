Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, for each test case there is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, while the conditions and constraints for `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are described in the initial state.
