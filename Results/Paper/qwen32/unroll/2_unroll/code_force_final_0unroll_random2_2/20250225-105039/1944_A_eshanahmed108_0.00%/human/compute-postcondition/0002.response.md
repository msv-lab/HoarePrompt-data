Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Specifically, if the input is invalid (e.g., `k` is greater than the maximum number of possible edges in a graph with `n` nodes), it may handle this case appropriately. Otherwise, it computes and returns a value determined by the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
