You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, the output will be n if n - k is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, the output will be 1. The values of t, n, and k will remain as per the input for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
- We start with a fully connected graph of n islands, meaning there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges.
- Dominater can destroy at most k bridges.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1.

### Key Observations:
1. If \(k = 0\), no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all \(n\) islands.
2. If Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Everule can only visit island 1. This happens when \(k \ge n-1\).
3. If \(0 < k < n-1\), Dominater cannot completely disconnect island 1 from all other islands, but can disconnect it from some of them. However, as long as \(k < n-1\), there will still be a path from island 1 to some other islands.

### Correctness of the Program:
The provided program uses the logic:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```
Let's break down the logic:
- `n - k <= 1` is true when \(k \ge n-1\). In this case, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit island 1.
- If `n - k > 1`, it means \(k < n-1\), and Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. In this case, Everule can visit all \(n\) islands.

However, there is a mistake in the logic:
- The condition `n - k <= 1` should be `k >= n-1` to correctly determine when island 1 can be disconnected from all other islands.
- The correct condition should be `k < n-1` for Everule to be able to visit all \(n\) islands.

### Corrected Logic:
The correct condition should be:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if k < n-1 else 1)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
