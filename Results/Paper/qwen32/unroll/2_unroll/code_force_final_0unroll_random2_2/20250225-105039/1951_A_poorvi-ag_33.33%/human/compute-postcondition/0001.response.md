The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.**
