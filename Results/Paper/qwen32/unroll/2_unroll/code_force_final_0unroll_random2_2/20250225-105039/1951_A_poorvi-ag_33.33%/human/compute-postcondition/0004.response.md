In the given task, the for loop iterates over the `results` list. Therefore, the state of `results` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The variables `start`, `end`, and `t` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to influence whether the loop executes.

Let's analyze the loop:

```
for r in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute at least once, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The values of `start`, `end`, and `t` do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` has at least one element.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list of strings (`'yes'` or `'no'`) that must have at least 1 element**.
