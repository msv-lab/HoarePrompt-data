To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for tc in range(t):`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The problem states that `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.

2. **Adjusting the State**: Since `t` is already defined to be within the range `1 <= t <= 1000`, we don't need to adjust its value further to ensure the loop executes. The condition `1 <= t` guarantees that the loop will execute at least once.

Given that the loop head only involves `t`, and `t` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute, the state does not need any additional adjustments.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000**
