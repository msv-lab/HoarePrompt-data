Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints the length of a specific list `ans` and the elements of `ans` based on the value of `k`. The list `ans` is constructed such that it contains three specific values derived from `k` and powers of 2, excluding the power of 2 that is used in one of the first three values.**
