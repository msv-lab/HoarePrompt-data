### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in each of the given strings of length 5. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 32.
2. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting only of 'A' and 'B'.
3. It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. The counter `l` is used to count the occurrences of 'A', and `h` is used to count the occurrences of 'B'.
4. It iterates over each character in the string:
   - If the character is 'A', it increments the counter `l`.
   - If the character is 'B', it increments the counter `h`.
5. After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, it compares the counters:
   - If `l` (count of 'A') is greater than `h` (count of 'B'), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

This logic correctly identifies which letter appears most frequently in each string. If the counts are equal, the program defaults to printing 'B', which aligns with the problem description and the provided example.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the most frequently occurring letter in each string of length 5. It handles all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
