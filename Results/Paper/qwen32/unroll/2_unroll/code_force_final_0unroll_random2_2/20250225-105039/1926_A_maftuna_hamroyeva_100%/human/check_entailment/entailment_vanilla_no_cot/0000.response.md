Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. The problem statement does not specify what to do in this case, but typically, such problems expect a consistent behavior. The provided program will incorrectly print 'B' when the counts are equal. To make it correct, you should handle the equality case, for example, by choosing one of the letters consistently or by modifying the problem's requirements.

Here's a corrected version of the program that handles the equality case by choosing 'A' when the counts are equal:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif h > l:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # or print('B') if you prefer to choose B in case of a tie

# Example usage
# func()
```

However, if the problem statement requires a specific behavior in case of a tie, you should follow that behavior. Assuming the tie-breaking rule is not specified, the original program is incorrect because it does not handle ties.
