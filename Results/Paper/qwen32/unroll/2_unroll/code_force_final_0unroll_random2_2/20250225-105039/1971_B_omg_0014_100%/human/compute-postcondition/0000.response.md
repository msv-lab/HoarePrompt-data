The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the input. The variables `t` and `s` from the initial state are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10; `n` is the input integer.**
