Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Tree Structure**:
   - The tree is described as an "array-like tree" with exactly two leaves.
   - This implies that the tree is a straight line (path) with two endpoints (leaves).

2. **Game Rules**:
   - Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone along the tree.
   - The stone can only be moved to an adjacent inactive node.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the number of moves available from the starting node is odd, Ron wins.
   - If the number of moves available from the starting node is even, Hermione wins.

### Explanation of the Program

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads the edges of the tree and constructs a deque (double-ended queue) representing the path.
   - The program assumes the tree is a straight line and builds it accordingly.

2. **Finding Moves**:
   - The program finds the index of the starting node in the deque.
   - It calculates the number of moves available to the left and right of the starting node.
   - The number of moves to the left is `idx` (index of the starting node).
   - The number of moves to the right is `n - idx - 1` (total nodes minus index minus one for the current node).

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - If either the number of moves to the left or right is odd, Ron wins.
   - If both numbers are even, Hermione wins.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - The program correctly constructs the tree as a deque by appending nodes to either end based on adjacency.
   - This works because the problem guarantees the tree is a path with two leaves.

2. **Move Calculation**:
   - The program accurately calculates the number of moves to the left and right of the starting node.
   - It correctly identifies the winner based on whether the number of moves is odd or even.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the starting node is at either end of the path (one move available).
   - It also handles the case where the starting node is in the middle (multiple moves available).

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
