Postcondition: **`tree` is a deque representing the path from one leaf to the other in the tree, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`. At least one of the values in `moves` is odd if the if condition is met; otherwise, both elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
