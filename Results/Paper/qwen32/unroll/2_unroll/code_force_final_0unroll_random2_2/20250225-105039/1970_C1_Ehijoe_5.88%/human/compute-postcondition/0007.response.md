The code snippet calculates the `moves` list based on the minimum of `t` and the distances from `idx` to the start and end of the `tree` deque. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is a deque representing the path from one leaf to the other in the tree, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`.** 

In simpler terms, the `moves` list now contains two values: the minimum of `t` and `idx`, and the minimum of `t` and the difference between `n` (the length of the deque) and `idx + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
