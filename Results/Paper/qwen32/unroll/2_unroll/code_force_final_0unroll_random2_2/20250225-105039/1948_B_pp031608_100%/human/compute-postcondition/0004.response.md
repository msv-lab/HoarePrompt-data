Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be modified by a specific rule such that all elements are in non-decreasing order. It prints 'YES' if the list can be modified accordingly, otherwise 'NO'.**
