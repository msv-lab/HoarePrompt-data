In the provided for loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the range `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python when the loop variable is not needed. The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the integer read from input and satisfies the condition 2 <= n <= 50.

Since the loop head only contains `_` and `n`, we need to ensure the state of `n` is correctly set for the loop to execute. The variables `t` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given that `n` must be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, we need to ensure that `n` falls within this range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99**
