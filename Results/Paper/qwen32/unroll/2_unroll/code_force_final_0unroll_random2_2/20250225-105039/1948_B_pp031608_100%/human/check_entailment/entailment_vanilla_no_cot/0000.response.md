Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation. Here are some issues with the program:

1. The program only checks if the current element and the previous one can be rearranged to form a sorted sequence by breaking down the previous element. This is not sufficient to ensure the entire array can be sorted.

2. The program does not handle the scenario where multiple elements need to be broken down and rearranged. It only checks adjacent elements and does not consider the global effect of breaking down elements.

3. The program should recursively or iteratively attempt to break down elements and check if the resulting array can be sorted. The current logic does not account for this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        changed = False
        new_arr = []
        for x in arr:
            if x >= 10:
                new_arr.extend([int(d) for d in str(x)])
                changed = True
            else:
                new_arr.append(x)
        if not changed:
            break
        arr = new_arr
    return arr == sorted(arr)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        print('YES' if can_be_sorted(arr) else 'NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program defines a helper function `can_be_sorted` that repeatedly breaks down elements in the array until no more elements can be broken down and then checks if the resulting array is sorted.
