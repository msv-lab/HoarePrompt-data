### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program and highlights why it does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting:**
   - The program only checks if splitting the current element and placing the next element right after it results in a sorted sequence. However, this is not sufficient. For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will incorrectly conclude that it is not possible to sort the array because it only checks a limited set of conditions.

2. **Not Considering All Possible Splits:**
   - The program does not consider all possible splits or placements that might lead to a sorted array. It only checks if splitting the current element and placing the next element right after it results in a sorted sequence. For instance, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the correct sequence of operations would be to split `12` into `[1, 2]`, then split `28` into `[2, 8]`, and finally split `5` into `[5]`. This would result in the sorted array `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of the Array:**
   - The program modifies the array by setting `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number, which does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting the number and placing its digits in the array. It does not handle the insertion of multiple digits into the array correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the given operation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
