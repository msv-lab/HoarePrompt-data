Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. The program iterates through the array from the end to the start, checking if the current element is smaller than the previous one. If it finds such a case, it attempts to split the previous element and checks if the resulting array (including the current element) is sorted. However, this approach does not correctly handle all possible cases and does not ensure that the entire array can be made non-decreasing through the allowed operations.

For instance, in the second test case of the example provided:
```
3
12 28 5
```
The program will compare `5` and `28`, see that `5` is smaller, and then attempt to split `28` into `[2, 8]`. It will then check if `[2, 8, 5]` is sorted, which it is not. However, the correct approach should be to consider all possible splits and transformations that could lead to a sorted array, not just the immediate transformation of the previous element.

The program incorrectly concludes that it's not possible to sort the array in this case, when in fact it might be possible through other transformations. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
