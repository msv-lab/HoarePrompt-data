The function computes and returns the maximum value between a variable `ans` and the length of a list `a` of non-negative integers. The list `a` and the integer `x` are obtained from other functions `func_1()` and `func_3()`, respectively. The variable `ans` is derived through a series of bitwise operations and comparisons involving the elements of `a` and the bits of `x`.
