You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function computes and returns the maximum value between a variable `ans` and the length of a list `a` of non-negative integers. The list `a` and the integer `x` are obtained from other functions `func_1()` and `func_3()`, respectively. The variable `ans` is derived through a series of bitwise operations and comparisons involving the elements of `a` and the bits of `x`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments in an array such that:
1. The segments are contiguous and cover the entire array from the first element to the last.
2. The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments is less than or equal to a given number \( x \).

### Program Analysis:
The program defines several functions for input reading and processes each test case individually. The main logic is implemented in `func_5()`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the number \( x \).
   - It then reads the array \( a \) of length \( n \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `t` and a variable `ans` to -1.
   - It iterates over each bit position from 29 to 0 (since \( x \) and the elements of the array are less than \( 2^{30} \)).
   - For each bit position \( i \):
     - It checks if the \( i \)-th bit of \( x \) and the sum of the \( i \)-th bits of all elements in the array are both zero. If so, it continues to the next bit.
     - If the \( i \)-th bit of \( x \) is zero and the sum of the \( i \)-th bits of the array elements is odd, it returns `ans` (which is -1 initially).
     - If the \( i \)-th bit of \( x \) is zero and the sum of the \( i \)-th bits of the array elements is even, it tries to split the array into segments such that the XOR of each segment has a zero \( i \)-th bit. If successful, it updates the array `a` with these segments.
     - If the \( i \)-th bit of \( x \) is one and the sum of the \( i \)-th bits of the array elements is odd, it continues to the next bit.
     - If the \( i \)-th bit of \( x \) is one and the sum of the \( i \)-th bits of the array elements is even and non-zero, it counts the maximum number of segments that can be formed such that the XOR of each segment has a zero \( i \)-th bit and updates `ans`.
     - If the \( i \)-th bit of \( x \) is one and the sum of the \( i \)-th bits of the array elements is zero, it breaks the loop.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum of `ans` and the length of the array \( n \).

### Correctness:
The program's logic seems to follow the problem statement closely, but there are several issues and potential errors:
1. **Initialization and Updates:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to -1, but it is not clear if this is the correct initial value for all cases.
   - The array `a` is updated with segments, but it is not clear if this update is correct or necessary for the final result.
2. **Logic for Bitwise Operations:**
   - The program uses bitwise operations to check and manipulate the bits of \( x \) and the elements of the array, but the logic for forming segments and updating `ans` is not straightforward and may not cover all edge cases.
3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle cases where \( n = 0 \) or \( x = 0 \), which could lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the program's logic, it is not immediately clear that the program is correct for all possible inputs. Therefore, we need to test the program with various test cases to ensure its correctness.

For now, based on the provided analysis, the correctness cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty without further testing. However, since the problem statement and the program's logic seem to align, and no obvious errors are found, we can tentatively assume the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

However, it is recommended to test the program with a wide range of test cases to ensure its correctness.
