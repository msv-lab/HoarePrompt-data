The code snippet `n, x = func_3()` means that the function `func_3()` returns two values, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `x`. Since the function `func_3()` is not defined in the given context, we can only assume that it returns new values for `n` and `x`.

Given that `n` was initially a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `x` was a non-negative integer representing the favorite number, after the execution of the code, `n` and `x` will take the values returned by `func_3()`. The length of the array `a` and the fact that `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` remain valid, but `n` and `x` themselves are updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_3()` representing the length of the array `a`, and `x` is a non-negative integer returned by `func_3()` representing the favorite number. `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`.**
