Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string by checking if it can switch from the top row to the bottom row at any point where the top row has a '1' and the bottom row has a '0'. If no such switch is possible, it simply concatenates the top row with the last element of the bottom row.

However, this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest string. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0010
1011
```

Expected Output:
```
0001
1
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- The lexicographically smallest string is `0001`.
- The only path that yields this string is: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,4).

The provided program will output:
```
0010
1
```

Explanation of the program's output:
- The program finds a switch point at `i = 2` (where `a[0][3] == '1'` and `a[1][2] == '0'`), resulting in the string `0010`.
- The number of paths yielding this string is incorrectly calculated as `1`.

This counterexample shows that the program does not handle all cases correctly and therefore is incorrect.
