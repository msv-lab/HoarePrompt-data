You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons (equal-sided) that can be formed from given sticks of specific lengths. The constraints are that each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be reused in more than one polygon. 

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `w`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of sticks, `ln`.
   - It reads the lengths of the sticks into a list, `palka`.
   - It creates a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` of unique stick lengths.
   - It calculates the number of stick lengths that occur at least 3 times (since a polygon requires at least 3 sides) and increments the `shapes` counter for each such length.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `shapes`.

### Issues in the Program
The program's logic has a flaw. It counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least 3 times, which does not necessarily give the correct number of polygons that can be formed. For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 3, it can form only 1 square (4-sided polygon) and not 2 triangles (3-sided polygons). 

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Count the occurrences of each stick length.
2. For each unique stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with that length. This is done by dividing the count of each stick length by the number of sides of the polygon (starting from 3 and going upwards) and taking the maximum possible number of polygons.
3. Sum up the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for all stick lengths.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the program's logic, the program is not correct for all cases. It only counts the number of stick lengths that appear at least 3 times, which does not account for the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using those sticks.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
