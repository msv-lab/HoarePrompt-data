### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob on a checkered board. The given program attempts to solve this problem by analyzing the initial positions of their chips and the possible moves they can make.

The program processes each test case by checking the relative positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and determining the outcome based on the following logic:

1. **If Alice's chip is in a row strictly below Bob's chip (`xa > xb`)**:
   - Alice can always move up towards Bob's chip, and Bob can move down towards Alice's chip. Since Alice starts first, she can always reach Bob's initial position before Bob can reach hers, provided there are enough rows for her to make the necessary moves. However, if Bob is in the first row, he can't move up, and Alice can't move down from her initial position if she's already in the last row. The program correctly identifies this scenario as a "Draw" because Alice can't win if she starts in a row strictly below Bob and Bob can't move up.

2. **If Alice's chip is in a row that is the same as or above Bob's chip (`xa <= xb`)**:
   - The program calculates the maximum distance Alice can move towards Bob's chip vertically (`x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`). This is because Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right, and Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right. If the distance is odd, Alice gets one extra move.
   - The program then calculates the range of columns (`l` to `r`) where Alice can be after her moves. If Alice can reach Bob's column within this range, she wins. Otherwise, Bob wins if he can reach Alice's column within the same range.
   - The program correctly identifies the outcome based on the calculated ranges and distances.

The provided program seems to handle all edge cases correctly, such as when Alice and Bob are in the same row, when Alice is in the last row, or when Bob is in the first row. The logic used to determine the winner or if the game ends in a draw appears to be sound.
