You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. For each test case, it determines whether "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" should be printed based on the relative positions of the points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` within a grid of dimensions `h` by `w`. The function outputs a result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Game Mechanics and Initial Observations**:
   - Alice starts and can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob moves up, up-left, or up-right.
   - The game ends in a win if a player lands on the other player's chip.
   - The game ends in a draw if a player cannot make a move.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `xa > xb`, Alice is already below Bob. Since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up, Alice cannot reach Bob's position, and Bob cannot reach Alice's position. Hence, the game ends in a draw.
   - If `xa <= xb`, Alice needs to move towards Bob, and Bob needs to move away or towards Alice.

3. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - The distance between Alice and Bob in the x-direction is `abs(xa - xb)`.
   - Alice's optimal strategy is to move diagonally towards Bob, and Bob's optimal strategy is to move diagonally away from Alice.
   - The variable `x` in the code is half of the distance between Alice and Bob in the x-direction (`abs(xa - xb) // 2`).

4. **Conditions for Winning**:
   - If the distance in the x-direction is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), Alice can potentially catch up with Bob.
     - `l` and `r` are the bounds within which Alice can move horizontally to reach Bob's column within `x + 1` moves.
     - If Alice can reach Bob's column within these bounds, Alice wins.
   - If the distance in the x-direction is even, Bob can potentially avoid Alice.
     - `l` and `r` are the bounds within which Bob can move horizontally to avoid Alice's column within `x` moves.
     - If Bob can avoid Alice's column within these bounds, Bob wins.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly implements the logic described above.
   - It correctly calculates the bounds (`l` and `r`) based on the distance in the x-direction.
   - It correctly checks if Alice can win when the distance is odd and if Bob can avoid Alice when the distance is even.
   - The use of tuple indexing in the print statement (`print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])`) is a concise way to select the output based on the condition.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the game logic and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
