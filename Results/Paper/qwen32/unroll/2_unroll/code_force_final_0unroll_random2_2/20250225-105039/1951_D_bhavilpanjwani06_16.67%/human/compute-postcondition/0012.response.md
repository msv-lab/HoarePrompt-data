Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input for the current test case such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (\(n \geq k\)).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (\(n \neq k\)).
- The current value of `k` is such that \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\) simplifies to \(2k < n + 1\), which further simplifies to \(k < \frac{n + 1}{2}\).
   - This means `k` is less than the midpoint of `n` (inclusive of the midpoint if `n` is odd).

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression `n - k + 1` represents the number of integers from `k` to `n` inclusive, starting from `k` and counting up to `n`.
   - Since `k < n`, `n - k + 1` will always be a positive integer greater than 1.

3. **Print Output:**
   - The first part of the print statement is `n - k + 1`, which is a positive integer based on the conditions provided.
   - The second part of the print statement is the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the print statement, the output will be the value of `n - k + 1` followed by `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is the number of integers from k to n inclusive)**
