The `print('NO')` statement will execute and print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` as they are not used within the print statement itself. The initial state provides conditions and constraints on the values of `n` and `k`, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **NO**
