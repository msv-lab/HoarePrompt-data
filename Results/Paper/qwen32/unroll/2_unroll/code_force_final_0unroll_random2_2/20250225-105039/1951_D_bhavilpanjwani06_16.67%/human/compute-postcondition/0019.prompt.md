You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(n)
            #This is printed: n (where n is equal to k)
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: - The first part of the print statement is `n - k + 1`, which is a positive integer based on the conditions provided.
                #   - The second part of the print statement is the integer `1`.
                #
                #### Conclusion:
                #Given the constraints and the print statement, the output will be the value of `n - k + 1` followed by `1`.
                #
                #### Final Output:
                #Output:
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input for the current test case such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, then the current value of `k` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.
        #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input for the current test case such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is compared with `n - k + 1`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input for the current test case such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}. If `n` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `n` is greater than `k`, `k - 1` is compared with `n - k + 1`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the current value of `k` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It presumably processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k` within specified ranges (1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. The specific result for each test case is not detailed here, but it implies that the function performs some computation or logic using `n` and `k` and returns an output for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
