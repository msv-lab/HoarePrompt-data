Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It presumably processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k` within specified ranges (1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. The specific result for each test case is not detailed here, but it implies that the function performs some computation or logic using `n` and `k` and returns an output for each test case.**
