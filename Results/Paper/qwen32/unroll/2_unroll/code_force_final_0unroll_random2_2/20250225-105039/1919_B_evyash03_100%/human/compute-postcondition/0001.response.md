In the given task, the for loop iterates over each character in the string `expression`. The loop head only involves the variable `char`, which represents each character in the string during each iteration. The variables `expression` and `length` are used to define the loop, but they are not modified within the loop head. The variable `count` is mentioned but is not part of the loop head.

To ensure that the loop can execute, the string `expression` must have at least one character. The variable `length` must be a positive integer that matches the length of the string `expression`. The variable `count` is not directly related to the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted in the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `expression` has at least one character and `length` matches the length of `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of the characters '+' and '-' with at least one character, `length` is a positive integer such that `length` == `len(expression)`, `count` is 0**
