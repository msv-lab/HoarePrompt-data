Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. The function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

To find the minimum penalty, we need to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays and instead calculates a single value based on the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

For example, consider the test case:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should be `0` because we can split the array into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`. However, the provided program will output `2` because it calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which is `|3 - 3| = 0` and then calculates `abs(3 - 3) = 0` but does not correctly handle the splitting logic.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
