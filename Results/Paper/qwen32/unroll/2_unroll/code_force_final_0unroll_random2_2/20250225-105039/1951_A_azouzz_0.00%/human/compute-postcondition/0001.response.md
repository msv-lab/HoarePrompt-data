The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop executes or not. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we only need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
