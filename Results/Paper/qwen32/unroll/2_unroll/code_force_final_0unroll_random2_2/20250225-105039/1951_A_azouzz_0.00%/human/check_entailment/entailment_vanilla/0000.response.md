Reasoning:  
The provided problem description and the given program do not match. The problem description outlines a Python script that scans through subdirectories within the current directory, checks if the subdirectory names fall within a specified numeric range, and then generates two new files (with extensions `-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in those subdirectories.

On the other hand, the given program defines a function `func_1` that reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, a string `s` of length `n`, counts the occurrences of the character '1' in the string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of the substring '11'.

Since the given program does not perform the tasks described in the problem statement, it is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
