Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then counts the occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. Based on the count of '1's and the presence of '11' in the string, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it outputs the results directly.**
