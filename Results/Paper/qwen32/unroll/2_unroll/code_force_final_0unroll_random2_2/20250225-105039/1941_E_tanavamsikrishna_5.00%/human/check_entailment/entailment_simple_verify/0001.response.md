### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
Bernard needs to cross a river represented as a grid. Rudolf will build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of the river, and the goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for these bridges. Each support in cell `(i, j)` has a cost of `a_{i,j} + 1`. Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of each row, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(row, d)`: This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports in a single row `row` with the constraint that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost to install supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`:
- The function starts by adding 1 to the first `d-1` elements of the row. This step is incorrect because it does not account for the minimum cost of placing supports with the constraint on distance `d`.
- The function then iterates through the rest of the row, updating each element to be the minimum cost of placing a support at that position, considering the previous `d` positions.
- The final element of the modified row is returned, which is supposed to represent the minimum cost of placing supports in that row.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- The function reads the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- It reads the grid of river depths.
- It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of placing supports in that row.
- It calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Issues:
- The implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. It does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of placing supports with the given constraints.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost in `func_1` is flawed, especially in the way it handles the distance `d` between supports.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1(row, d)`:
The function `func_1(row, d)` is intended to compute the minimum cost of placing supports in a row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`. However, the current implementation does not correctly achieve this.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1. This is incorrect because it assumes that the first `d-1` supports can be placed without considering the cost of previous supports, which is not true.
   
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each element from `d-1` to the end of the row, the cost is updated based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements. However, this does not correctly account for the constraints of placing supports at the beginning and end of the row and ensuring the distance between supports is at most `d`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a row. The dynamic programming approach would involve maintaining a list where each element represents the minimum cost to place a support at that position, considering the constraints.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the implementation of `func_1`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
