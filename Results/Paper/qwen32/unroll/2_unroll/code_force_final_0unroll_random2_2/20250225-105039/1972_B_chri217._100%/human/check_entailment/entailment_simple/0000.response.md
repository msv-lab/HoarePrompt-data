### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle, where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The key insight here is that the game's outcome can be determined by the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') at the start. If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win; if it is even, Bob will win. This is because each move removes one 'U' coin and flips its neighbors, potentially changing the number of 'U' coins by an odd number (either adding or subtracting one or three 'U' coins, depending on the configuration). Since the game starts with an odd or even number of 'U' coins, and each move changes the count by an odd number, the parity of the number of 'U' coins will alternate between odd and even with each move. Therefore, the player who starts (Alice) will win if the initial count of 'U' coins is odd, and the second player (Bob) will win if it is even.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. `func_1` reads the input and organizes it into a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing the number of coins and the string representing their states. `func_2` then calculates the number of 'U' coins in each test case and determines the winner based on the parity of this count.
