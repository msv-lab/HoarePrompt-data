Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves a circle of coins, each being either facing up ('U') or down ('D'). Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine if Alice (the first player) will win if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
2. The outcome of the game is determined by the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration.
3. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win. If it is even, Bob will win.
4. This is because each move removes one facing-up coin and flips two adjacent coins (which might change the parity of the number of facing-up coins). The game ends when the number of facing-up coins becomes zero, and the parity of the number of moves made will determine the winner.

### Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Reads the input and returns a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the number of coins and the string representing the coins.
2. `func_2(case)`: Determines the winner for a given test case based on the number of facing-up coins. If the number of 'U's is odd, it returns "YES" (Alice wins); otherwise, it returns "NO" (Bob wins).

### Verification
Let's verify the logic of the program with the provided example:
- For the first test case with `n = 5` and `s = "UUDUD"`, the number of 'U's is 3 (odd). The program should return "YES".
- For the second test case with `n = 5` and `s = "UDDUD"`, the number of 'U's is 2 (even). The program should return "NO".
- For the third test case with `n = 2` and `s = "UU"`, the number of 'U's is 2 (even). The program should return "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion
The program is correct as it accurately determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
