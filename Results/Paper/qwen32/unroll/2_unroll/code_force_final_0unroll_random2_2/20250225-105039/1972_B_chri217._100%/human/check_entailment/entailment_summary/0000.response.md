Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins ("U") in the initial configuration. The game rules and the optimal play strategy imply that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of "U" coins determines the winner. Specifically, if the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because each move flips two adjacent coins, preserving the parity of the number of "U" coins until the game ends.

Let's break down the functions:
- `func_1()` reads the input and correctly parses it into a list of tuples, each containing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial configuration of coins for each test case.
- `func_2(case)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins in the string `s` by counting the "U" characters and checking if the count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns "YES" (indicating Alice wins), otherwise it returns "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

Since both functions together accurately implement the logic required by the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
