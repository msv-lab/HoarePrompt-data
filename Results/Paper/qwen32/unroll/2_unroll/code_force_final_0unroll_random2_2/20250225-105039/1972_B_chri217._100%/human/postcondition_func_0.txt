The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the number of coins (1 <= n <= 100), and the string `s` is of length `n` and contains only the characters "U" and "D". The function returns a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the `n` and `s` values from each test case.
