### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) and `bx` to a small value (`-1`). `ax` will store the minimum value of `x` for constraints of type 2, and `bx` will store the maximum value of `x` for constraints of type 1.
   
3. **Reading Constraints:**
   - It reads `n` constraints, and for each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
   
4. **Calculating the Number of Valid `k` Values:**
   - After processing all constraints, if `bx >= ax`, it means there are no valid `k` values that satisfy both types 1 and 2 constraints simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the number of values in `cx` that lie between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`. This is done by initializing `tmp` to `0` and incrementing it for each value in `cx` that lies in this range. Finally, it appends `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to `r`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results stored in `r`, each on a new line.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Range Calculation:**
  - The range of valid `k` values is correctly calculated as `[bx, ax]` if `bx < ax`.
  - The set `cx` is used to exclude values that `k` cannot take due to constraints of type 3.
  - The logic to count the number of excluded values (`tmp`) and subtract it from the total number of integers in the range is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `bx >= ax`, the program correctly identifies that there are no valid `k` values and returns `0`.
  - The program handles large values of `x` up to `10^9` as required by the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases, it is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
