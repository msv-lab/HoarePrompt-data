In the provided code snippet, the loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`, but since it's a throwaway variable, adjusting it doesn't make sense in this context. Instead, we need to ensure that `t` is set correctly so that the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. There are no other variables in the loop head that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500**
