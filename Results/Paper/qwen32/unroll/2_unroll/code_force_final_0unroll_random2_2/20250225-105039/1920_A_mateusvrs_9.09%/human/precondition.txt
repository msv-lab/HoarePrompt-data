t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each of the following n lines contains two integers a and x where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a denotes the type of constraint (1 for k ≥ x, 2 for k ≤ x, and 3 for k ≠ x). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
