You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is the final value of `ans` after the loop has computed the sum of `n` and the integer divisions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and each test case's `n` and `m` are processed independently to produce a separate output value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on `n` and the integer divisions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, and prints this result. The number of test cases is specified by the input integer `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations

1. For \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\), which is always true. Therefore, there are \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\).
2. For \(b > 1\), we need \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\). Simplifying, we get \(a = (k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) - b\). This equation suggests that \(a\) must be such that the right side is an integer and within the range [1, n].

### Simplification

Given the constraints, a more efficient way to count valid pairs is to iterate over possible values of \(b\) and count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). The provided program does this by iterating \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to the answer. This formula counts the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It initializes the answer \(ans\) with \(n\) (since there are \(n\) valid pairs for \(b = 1\)).
4. It then iterates \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to the answer.
5. Finally, it prints the answer for each test case.

### Verification

The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\) based on the problem's requirements. The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) and correctly sums up the counts of valid pairs.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
