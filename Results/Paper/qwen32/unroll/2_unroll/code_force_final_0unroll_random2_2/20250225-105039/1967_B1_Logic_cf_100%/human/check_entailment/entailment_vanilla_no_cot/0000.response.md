Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic in the given code is incorrect.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Counting of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect. The initial count should be 0 because we need to count only the valid pairs, and we haven't checked any pairs yet.

2. **Loop Over `b`**: The loop over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)` is correct in terms of range, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs for each `b`.

3. **Missing Loop Over `a`**: The program does not loop over `a` for each `b` to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Condition Check**: The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked for each pair \((a, b)\). This requires calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\) for each pair, which is not done in the provided program.

To fix the program, you need to loop over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition holds for each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version loops over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. If it is, it increments the count `ans`.
