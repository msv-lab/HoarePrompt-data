Let's carefully re-evaluate the given program and its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations

1. For \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\), which is always true. Therefore, there are \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\).
2. For \(b > 1\), the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\). This can be simplified to \(a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\). This equation suggests that \(a\) must be such that the right side is an integer and within the range \([1, n]\).

### Simplification

Given the constraints, a more efficient way to count valid pairs is to iterate over possible values of \(b\) and count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). The provided program does this by iterating \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to the answer. This formula counts the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It initializes the answer \(ans\) with \(n\) (since there are \(n\) valid pairs for \(b = 1\)).
4. It then iterates \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to the answer.
5. Finally, it prints the answer for each test case.

### Verification

The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\) based on the problem's requirements. The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) and correctly sums up the counts of valid pairs.

However, let's verify the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) more rigorously. For a given \(b\), we need to count the number of \(a\) such that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\). This simplifies to \(a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\), and \(a\) must be in the range \([1, n]\).

The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) counts the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\) by ensuring that \(a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\) is within the range \([1, n]\).

### Challenge to the Original Assessment

The original assessment assumes that the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). However, let's consider a specific example to verify this.

For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
- When \(b = 1\), there are \(n = 2\) valid pairs: \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 1)\).
- When \(b = 2\), the formula gives \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 + 2}{2 \cdot 2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{4}{4} \right\rfloor = 1\). The valid pair is \((2, 2)\).
- When \(b = 3\), the formula gives \(\left\lfloor \frac{2 + 3}{3 \cdot 3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{5}{9} \right\rfloor = 0\). There are no valid pairs.

Total valid pairs: \(2 + 1 + 0 = 3\), which matches the example output.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and verification with the example, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
