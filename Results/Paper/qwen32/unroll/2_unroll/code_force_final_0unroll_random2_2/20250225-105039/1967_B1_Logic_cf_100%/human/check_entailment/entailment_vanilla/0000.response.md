Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations

1. For \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\), which is always true. Therefore, there are \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\).
2. For \(b > 1\), we need \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\). Simplifying, we get \(a = (k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) - b\). This equation suggests that \(a\) must be such that the right side is an integer and within the range [1, n].

### Simplification

Given the constraints, a more efficient way to count valid pairs is to iterate over possible values of \(b\) and count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). The provided program does this by iterating \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to the answer. This formula counts the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It initializes the answer \(ans\) with \(n\) (since there are \(n\) valid pairs for \(b = 1\)).
4. It then iterates \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to the answer.
5. Finally, it prints the answer for each test case.

### Verification

The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) correctly counts the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\) based on the problem's requirements. The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) and correctly sums up the counts of valid pairs.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
