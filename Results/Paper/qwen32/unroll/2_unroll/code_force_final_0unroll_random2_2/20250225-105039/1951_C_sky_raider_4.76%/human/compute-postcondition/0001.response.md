To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the provided code and understand what it does.

### Code Analysis

The code consists of a loop that reads `i` test cases, where each test case involves:
1. Reading three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. Reading a list `l` of `n` integers.
3. Sorting the list `l`.
4. Initializing `s` to 0 and `c` to `k * k / 2`.
5. Iterating over the sorted list `l` and updating `s` and `c` based on the values of `m`, `k`, and elements of `l`.
6. Printing the integer value of `c` after processing the list `l`.

### Calculating the Output State

The output of each test case is the integer value of `c` after the loop finishes processing the list `l`. The value of `c` is updated as follows:
- `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`.
- `k` is reduced by `s`.
- `c` is incremented by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each element in the sorted list.

The final value of `c` is printed for each test case.

### Output State

Since the initial state describes multiple test cases, the output state will consist of the final values of `c` for each test case, printed one per line.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume we have the following input:
```
2
3 5 4
1 2 3
2 3 2
4 5
```

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 3`, `m = 5`, `k = 4`
   - `l = [1, 2, 3]`
   - `l` is already sorted.
   - `c = 4 * 4 / 2 = 8`
   - Iteration 1: `s = min(5, 4) = 4`, `k = 4 - 4 = 0`, `c = 8 + 1 * 4 - 4 * 4 / 2 = 8 + 4 - 8 = 4`
   - Iteration 2: `s = min(5, 0) = 0`, `k = 0 - 0 = 0`, `c = 4 + 2 * 0 - 0 * 0 / 2 = 4`
   - Iteration 3: `s = min(5, 0) = 0`, `k = 0 - 0 = 0`, `c = 4 + 3 * 0 - 0 * 0 / 2 = 4`
   - Output for first test case: `4`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 2`, `m = 3`, `k = 2`
   - `l = [4, 5]`
   - `l` is already sorted.
   - `c = 2 * 2 / 2 = 2`
   - Iteration 1: `s = min(3, 2) = 2`, `k = 2 - 2 = 0`, `c = 2 + 4 * 2 - 2 * 2 / 2 = 2 + 8 - 2 = 8`
   - Iteration 2: `s = min(3, 0) = 0`, `k = 0 - 0 = 0`, `c = 8 + 5 * 0 - 0 * 0 / 2 = 8`
   - Output for second test case: `8`

### Final Output State

Given the example input, the output state would be:
```
Output State: **4
8**
```

However, since the input is not provided in the question, the output state format will be:

Output State: **the output state you calculate based on the provided input.**
