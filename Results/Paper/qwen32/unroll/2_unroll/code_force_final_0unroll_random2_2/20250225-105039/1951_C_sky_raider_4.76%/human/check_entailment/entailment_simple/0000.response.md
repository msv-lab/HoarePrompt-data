Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The core issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum cost to purchase the tickets. The program incorrectly calculates the cost `c` by initializing it with `k * k / 2`, which is arbitrary and unrelated to the problem's requirements. Additionally, the logic for buying tickets and updating the cost is flawed. The program does not account for the price increase on subsequent days correctly, and the way tickets are purchased (using `min(m, k)`) does not guarantee the minimum cost.

A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated strategy, possibly using a greedy algorithm or a binary search combined with a prefix sum array to efficiently determine the optimal number of tickets to buy each day while keeping track of the price increases.

Given the issues with the provided program, it is clear that it does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
