Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the following k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} each (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and is always at the top of the list. All authors of the screenshots are different.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is read from the input and assigned to the variable `t`. The initial state of `t` being an integer within the range 1 to 10^4 is preserved. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
