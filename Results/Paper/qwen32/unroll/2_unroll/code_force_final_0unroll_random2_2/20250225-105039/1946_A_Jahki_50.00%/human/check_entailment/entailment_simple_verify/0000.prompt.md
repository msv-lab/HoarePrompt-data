You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Median Calculation**: The code calculates the median index `ma` correctly for odd and even lengths of the array. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the median needs to be increased. The logic to increase the median is flawed.

2. **Inefficient Median Increase Logic**: The code attempts to increase the median by incrementing the element at the median index and then re-sorting the array in a loop until the median increases. This approach is inefficient and incorrect. It should increment the smallest necessary elements to ensure the median increases.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code includes a condition to print `1` and `16668` if `num2 > 10000`, which is not relevant to the problem and does not make sense in the context of the problem description.

4. **Logic to Increase Median**: The logic to increase the median is incorrect. The code should identify the smallest elements that need to be incremented to ensure the median increases. The current logic only increments the median element, which is not always the correct approach.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = num2 // 2 - 1
        else:
            ma = num2 // 2
        median = a[ma]
        new_median = median
        operations = 0
        while new_median <= median:
            a[ma] += 1
            operations += 1
            a.sort()
            new_median = a[ma]
        print(operations)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

However, even this corrected version can be optimized further by using a more efficient approach to increment the necessary elements without re-sorting the array in each iteration. But the primary issue with the original code is the incorrect logic to increase the median, which is why it is marked as incorrect.
