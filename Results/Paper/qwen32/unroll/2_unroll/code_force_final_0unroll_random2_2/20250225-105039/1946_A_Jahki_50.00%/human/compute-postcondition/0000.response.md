The code snippet provided is `num = int(input())`. This line of code will read an input from the user, convert it to an integer, and assign it to the variable `num`. The initial state includes the variable `t` which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

After executing the code, the variable `num` will hold the value of the integer input provided. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `num` is the integer value of the input provided.**
