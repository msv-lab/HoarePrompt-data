To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the provided loop and its behavior:

1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(0, num):`)**:
   - The outer loop runs `num` times.
   - For each iteration, it reads an integer `num2` and a string `case`.
   - It initializes `op` to 0.

2. **Condition Check (`if num2 > 10000`)**:
   - If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668`, then breaks out of the loop.
   - If `num2` is not greater than 10000, it continues with the processing.

3. **Processing for `num2 <= 10000`**:
   - It converts the string `case` into a list of integers `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` to get `b`.
   - It calculates the median of `b` based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - It then enters a `while` loop where it increments the median value in `b` until it exceeds the original median, counting the number of operations (`op`).

4. **Output**:
   - For each iteration, it prints the number of operations `op`.

Given that the loop can potentially break early if `num2 > 10000`, the final state of the variables depends on the values of `num2` in each iteration.

### Output State Analysis:
- `num` remains unchanged as it is the loop control variable.
- `num2` and `case` are re-assigned in each iteration and do not persist beyond the current iteration.
- `op` is re-initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration and its value is printed at the end of the iteration.
- `a` and `b` are lists that are created and modified within each iteration and do not persist beyond the current iteration.
- `median` and `new_median` are variables that are calculated and modified within each iteration and do not persist beyond the current iteration.

Since the loop can break early, the final state of the variables `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `median`, and `new_median` will depend on the specific values encountered during the loop iterations. However, the variable `num` will remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **num is unchanged; num2, case, op, a, b, median, new_median are undefined or based on the last iteration's values if the loop did not break.**
