### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, sorting the array, and incrementing the median value until it becomes strictly greater than the original median. However, there are several issues with the code:

1. **Handling of Large `n`:** The code includes a condition to break the loop and print specific values if `n` is greater than 10000. This is not a correct approach as there is no special rule or requirement in the problem statement that would justify such a behavior. This part of the code is incorrect and should be removed.

2. **Incrementing the Median:** The code increments the median value directly in the sorted array `b`. However, this does not reflect the changes in the original array `a`. To correctly simulate the operations, the increments should be applied to the corresponding elements in the original array `a`, and then the array should be resorted to find the new median. The current approach does not ensure that the minimum number of operations is used, as it only increments the median value in the sorted array without considering the impact on other elements.

3. **Efficiency:** The code resorts the array `b` after each increment, which is inefficient. Sorting the array has a time complexity of O(n log n), and doing this in a loop can lead to a time complexity of O(n^2 log n) for each test case, which is not feasible given the constraints (n up to 10^5).

4. **Edge Cases:** The code does not handle edge cases where the array has only one element or where all elements are the same. While the logic might work for these cases, the incorrect handling of increments and sorting would still be an issue.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the provided code is not correct. Therefore, the correctness is:

**Correctness: False**
