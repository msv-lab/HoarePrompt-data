Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute).

2. **Converting Hours:**
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it is converted to 12 and marked as 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it is converted to `h - 12` and marked as 'PM'.
   - If the hour `h` is between 1 and 11, it remains the same and is marked as 'AM'.
   - If the hour `h` is 12, it remains the same but is marked as 'PM'.

3. **Printing Output:**
   - The program prints the converted hour and minute in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" with leading zeros preserved using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`.

4. **Checking Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases of `00:00` (midnight) and `12:00` (noon).

The program logic aligns with the problem description and handles all cases correctly as per the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
