Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Reasoning:

1. **Function Call Before Definition:**
   - The program starts with `func_1()`, which is a call to a function named `func_1`. However, `func_1` is defined after this call. This will result in a `NameError` because the function is called before it is defined in the code.

2. **Logic for Placing Icons:**
   - The program aims to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons.
   - **Case 1: Both x and y are greater than 0**
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (as they occupy 4 cells each), this part is correct.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. The intention seems to be to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, the logic here is flawed. `bxsfory * 15` suggests 15 cells are occupied by `bxsfory` 2x2 icons, which is incorrect. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so it should be `bxsfory * 4`. Additionally, `y * 4` is added to `x`, which doesn't make sense in this context.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`: This line attempts to calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, the previous line's logic is flawed, so this calculation will also be incorrect.
     - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This line adds the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 2: x is 0 and y is greater than 0**
     - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This is correct. It calculates the minimum number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
   - **Case 3: x is greater than 0 and y is 0**
     - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This is incorrect. Each screen can fit 15 1x1 icons (5 rows * 3 columns), so it should be `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - **Case 4: Both x and y are 0**
     - `print(0)`: This is correct. No screens are needed if there are no icons.

### Conclusion:
The program contains several logical errors and a syntax error due to the function call before its definition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
