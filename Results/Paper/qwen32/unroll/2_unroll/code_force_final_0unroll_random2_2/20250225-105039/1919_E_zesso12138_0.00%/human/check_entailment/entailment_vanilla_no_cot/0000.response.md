To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze its logic and how it addresses the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Hidden Array `a`**: The array `a` consists of `1` and `-1` only.
2. **Prefix Sums `p`**: The prefix sums `p` are derived from `a` where `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`.
3. **Sorted Prefix Sums**: The array `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. **Objective**: Given the sorted prefix sums, determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could have generated this sorted prefix sums.

### Approach of the Program:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**:
    - `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum of `j - offset` after `i` steps.
    - `offset = n` is used to shift the range of possible sums from `[-n, n]` to `[0, 2n]`, making it easier to index.
    - Initialize `dp[offset] = 1` because there's one way to have a sum of `0` after `0` steps.

2. **DP Transition**:
    - For each step `i` from `1` to `n`, update the `dp` array:
        - For each possible sum `j`, if `dp[j] > 0`, it means there are ways to reach this sum.
        - From this sum, you can either add `1` (move to `j+1`) or subtract `1` (move to `j-1`), updating the respective `new_dp` values accordingly.
    - After processing each step, set `dp = new_dp` to move to the next step.

3. **Final Calculation**:
    - The final sum to check is `p[-1] + offset` because `p[-1]` is the last (and largest) element of the sorted prefix sums.
    - The value `dp[final_sum]` gives the number of ways to achieve the sorted prefix sums `p`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
    - The program reads multiple test cases, processes each one using `func_1`, and stores the results.
    - Finally, it prints each result.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Initialization**: The initialization of `dp` with `dp[offset] = 1` is correct as there's one way to have a sum of `0` after `0` steps.
- **DP Transition**: The logic for updating `dp` based on adding or subtracting `1` is correct. It ensures that all possible prefix sums are considered.
- **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum is correctly calculated as `p[-1] + offset` to check the number of ways to reach the last element of the sorted prefix sums.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case, and storing the results.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic correctly implements the required approach to solve the problem. It efficiently uses dynamic programming to count the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could generate the given sorted prefix sums.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
