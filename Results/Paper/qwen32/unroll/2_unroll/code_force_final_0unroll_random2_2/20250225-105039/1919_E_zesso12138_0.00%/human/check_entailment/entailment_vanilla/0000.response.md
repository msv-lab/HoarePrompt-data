### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the number of possible arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that when the prefix sums of `a` are calculated and sorted, they match a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, p)`: This function calculates the number of valid arrays `a` for a given `n` and sorted prefix sum array `p`. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the possible prefix sums that can be achieved at each step. The `dp` array represents the number of ways to achieve a particular prefix sum (with an offset to handle negative sums).
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1`:
- `dp` is initialized with a size of `2*n + 1` to handle prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`. The offset `n` is used to map these sums to indices in the `dp` array.
- The initial state is set with `dp[offset] = 1`, representing the single way to have a prefix sum of `0` at the start.
- For each element in the array `a`, the possible prefix sums are updated. If the current prefix sum is `j`, the next prefix sum can be `j + 1` (if the next element in `a` is `1`) or `j - 1` (if the next element in `a` is `-1`).
- The final result is obtained by checking the value of `dp` at the position corresponding to `p[-1] + offset`, which is the final prefix sum of the sorted array `p`.

The logic of `func_1` correctly models the problem using dynamic programming and ensures that all possible ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum array `p` are counted.

### Correctness:

The solution correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles the constraints efficiently. It correctly calculates the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

Thus, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Correctness: True**
