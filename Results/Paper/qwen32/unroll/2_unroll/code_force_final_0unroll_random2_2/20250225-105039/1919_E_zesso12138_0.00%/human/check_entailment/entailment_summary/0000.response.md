Reasoning:

The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` such that when their prefix sums are sorted, they match a given sorted array `p`. The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to construct an array `a` that would result in the given sorted prefix sums `p`.
   - The `dp` array is used to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value. The `offset` is used to handle negative prefix sums by shifting the range of possible sums to non-negative indices.
   - For each element in `p`, the function updates the `dp` array to reflect the number of ways to reach the next prefix sum by either adding 1 or subtracting 1.
   - The final result is obtained from the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the last element of `p` plus the `offset`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the sorted prefix sums `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` with the parameters `n` and `p` to compute the number of valid arrays `a` for that test case.
   - It stores the result for each test case and prints all results at the end.

The provided execution summaries suggest that `func_1` is correctly implemented to count the number of ways to form the prefix sums as described. `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

However, there is a discrepancy in the description of `func_2`'s output hints. The output hints state that `func_2` "reconstructs an array `a` from given prefix sums `p` and prints the reconstructed array for each test case," which is incorrect. Instead, `func_2` should print the count of valid arrays `a` for each test case, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the code appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem as described, despite the minor inaccuracy in the description of `func_2`'s output hints.

Correctness: **True**
