### Reasoning:

The given problem requires counting the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can result in a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The solution provided uses dynamic programming to achieve this.

#### Explanation of the Program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to accommodate the range of prefix sums which can go from `-n` to `n`.
   - `offset = n` is used to map the range `-n` to `n` to the indices `0` to `2 * n` of the `dp` array.
   - `dp[offset]` is set to `1` because there's exactly one way to have a prefix sum of `0` at the start (i.e., no elements in the array).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, the prefix sum can either increase by `1` (if the element is `1`) or decrease by `1` (if the element is `-1`).
   - `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` are updated based on the current `dp[j]` to reflect the possible transitions.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the counts do not exceed the required modulo `998244353`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final state of `dp` represents the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
   - The result is fetched from `dp[final_sum]` where `final_sum = p[-1] + offset`, which corresponds to the number of ways to reach the last prefix sum in the sorted array `p`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each one, collecting the results and printing them.

#### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
  - The only possible prefix sum array before sorting would be `[0]`, which can only be achieved by `a = [0]`. However, `a` can only consist of `1` and `-1`. Thus, no valid `a` exists, and the output is `0`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
  - The only possible `a` is `[1]`, which results in `p = [1]`. Thus, the output is `1`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
  - No valid `a` can produce this sorted prefix sum array, so the output is `0`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - Three valid `a` arrays exist: `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`, `[1, -1, -1, 1, 1]`, and `[-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]`. Thus, the output is `3`.

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
  - Only one valid `a` array exists: `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`. Thus, the output is `1`.

#### Conclusion:
The dynamic programming approach correctly counts the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p` for all provided test cases.
