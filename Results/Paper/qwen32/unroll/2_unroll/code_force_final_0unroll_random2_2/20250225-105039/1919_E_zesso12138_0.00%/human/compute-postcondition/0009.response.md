To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the loop and understand what it does with the given variables.

The loop iterates over `results` and prints each element. Since the loop only involves printing and does not modify any of the variables `n`, `p`, `index`, `t`, `data`, `input`, or `results` itself, their values remain unchanged.

Here's the breakdown:
- The loop does not change `n`, `p`, `index`, `t`, `data`, or `input`.
- The loop prints each element of `results`, but this does not change the contents of `results`.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state except that the elements of `results` will have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `index` is the position after the last `p` was read, `t` is the initial integer value, `data` is the initial list of strings, `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, and `results` is a list of results from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration. The elements of `results` have been printed.**
