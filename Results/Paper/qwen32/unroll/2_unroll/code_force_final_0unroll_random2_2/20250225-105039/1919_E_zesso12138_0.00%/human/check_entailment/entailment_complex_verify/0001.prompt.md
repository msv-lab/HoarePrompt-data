You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that the sorted prefix sums array `p` matches the given sorted prefix sums array.

### Key Points:
1. **Prefix Sums:** The prefix sums array `p` is computed as `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`.
2. **Sorting:** The array `p` is then sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Counting Valid Arrays:** We need to count the number of valid initial arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sums array `p`.

### Approach in the Program:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** The program uses a DP approach to count the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.
2. **Offset:** An offset of `n` is used to handle negative indices since prefix sums can be negative.
3. **Transition:** For each element in `a`, the prefix sum either increases by `1` or decreases by `1`. The DP table is updated accordingly.
4. **Final Count:** The final count is retrieved from the DP table based on the final value of the prefix sum in the sorted array `p`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initialization:** `dp[offset] = 1` initializes the DP table with a single way to reach the sum `0`.
- **DP Transition:** For each position `i` in the array `a`, the DP table is updated for both possible transitions (`+1` and `-1`).
- **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation ensures that the count does not overflow and remains within the required constraints.
- **Final Sum Retrieval:** The final sum is adjusted by adding the offset to match the correct index in the DP table.

### Validation Against Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 1`, `p = [0]`. No valid array can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 1`, `p = [1]`. Only `a = [1]` produces this sorted prefix sum array.
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`. No valid array can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`. Three valid arrays can produce this sorted prefix sum array.
- **Test Case 5:** `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`. Only `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]` produces this sorted prefix sum array.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid initial arrays `a` for each test case. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
