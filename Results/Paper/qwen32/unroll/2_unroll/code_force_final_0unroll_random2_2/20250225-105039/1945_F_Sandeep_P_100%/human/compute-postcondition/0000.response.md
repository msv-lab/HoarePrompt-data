The provided code snippet is a docstring for a decorator function, which describes its purpose but does not actually execute any code that changes the state of variables. Therefore, there are no variables being modified, and no new variables being introduced. The initial state of `fillvalue` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`fillvalue` is a string that represents the value to return when a recursive call is detected.**
