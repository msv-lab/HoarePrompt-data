Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on any substring of the string. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `k` is `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It converts the string into a list of integers (0s and 1s).
4. It counts the total number of 0s in the string.
5. It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
6. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
7. It iterates through the string:
   - If the current character is 0, it adds 1 to the cost if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the current character is 1, it adds the number of remaining 0s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost.
8. Finally, it prints the total cost for each test case.

### Logic Verification:
1. **Counting Cost for 0s**:
   - When a 0 is encountered and there have been 1s before it, it means that this 0 needs to be moved past those 1s to the left, incurring a cost. The cost is 1 for each such 0 because it can be moved by a cyclic shift of the substring containing this 0 and the 1s before it.
   
2. **Counting Cost for 1s**:
   - When a 1 is encountered, all remaining 0s need to be moved to the left of this 1 to sort the string. The cost is the number of remaining 0s because each of these 0s needs to be moved past this 1.

### Edge Cases:
- If the string is already sorted (all 0s followed by all 1s), the cost is 0.
- If the string is completely 0s or completely 1s, the cost is also 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. It correctly accounts for the cost of moving 0s past 1s and vice versa.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
