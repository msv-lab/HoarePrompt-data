To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary, and then compare the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `k` is `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program `func_1` does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reads a binary string `s`.
3. Converts the string into a list of integers.
4. Counts the total number of 0s in the string.
5. Initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
6. Initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
7. Iterates through the string:
   - If the current character is 0 and there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to the cost (`ans`).
   - If the current character is 1, it adds the number of remaining 0s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost (`ans`).
8. Prints the total cost for each test case.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the printed value for each test case represents the number of valid pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the substring `s[i:j+1]` contains at least one '0' and one '1'. However, this summary does not directly align with the logic of the program, which calculates the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.

### Logic Verification:
Let's verify the logic:

1. **Counting Cost for 0s**:
   - When a 0 is encountered after a 1, it means that this 0 needs to be moved past those 1s to the left, incurring a cost. The cost is 1 for each such 0 because it can be moved by a cyclic shift of the substring containing this 0 and the 1s before it.
   
2. **Counting Cost for 1s**:
   - When a 1 is encountered, all remaining 0s need to be moved to the left of this 1 to sort the string. The cost is the number of remaining 0s because each of these 0s needs to be moved past this 1.

### Edge Cases:
- If the string is already sorted (all 0s followed by all 1s), the cost is 0.
- If the string is completely 0s or completely 1s, the cost is also 0.

### Critical Evaluation:
The program logic seems to be incorrect in its approach to calculating the cost. The cost calculation should consider the actual length of the substrings being cyclically shifted, not just the number of transitions between 0s and 1s. The provided function summary does not align with the program's logic, and the original assessment does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example given in the problem description:
- For the string "101011", the correct minimum cost is 5. The program's logic does not correctly calculate this cost.
- For the string "01101001", the correct minimum cost is 11. The program's logic does not correctly calculate this cost either.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The program's logic does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
