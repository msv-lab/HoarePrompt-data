To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and understand what actions it performs. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for _ in range(numero_testes):
    func_1()
```

Here, `numero_testes` is an integer that determines the number of iterations the loop will execute. The loop does not modify `numero_testes` itself, and it calls the function `func_1()` in each iteration. Since the problem does not specify what `func_1()` does, we can only infer the state of `numero_testes` and the loop variable `_`.

- `numero_testes` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that takes on values from 0 to `numero_testes - 1` during each iteration, but its final value is not retained outside the loop.

Thus, the only thing we can definitively state about the output state is that `numero_testes` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`numero_testes` retains its initial value.**
