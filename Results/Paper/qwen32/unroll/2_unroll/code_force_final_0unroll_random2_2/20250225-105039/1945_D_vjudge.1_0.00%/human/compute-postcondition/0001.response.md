In the given task, the for loop iterates `numero_testes` times. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times. The loop will execute if `numero_testes` is greater than 0. 

Given the state before the loop starts, `numero_testes` is already assigned a value between 1 and 10^4 by `int(input())`. Since `numero_testes` is guaranteed to be within this range, the loop will definitely execute at least once because the minimum value of `numero_testes` is 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `numero_testes` for the loop to execute. The state remains as provided.

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, and `numero_testes` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**
