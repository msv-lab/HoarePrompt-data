Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, and `numero_testes` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

Natural Language: The initial value of `numero_testes` is overwritten by the integer value provided through the input. The precondition that `numero_testes` must be an integer within the range 1 to 10,000 (inclusive) remains valid.
