Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each encoded value correctly.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value by distributing it across three letters.
   - For each test case, it initializes an array `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop to fill the first two positions of `arr`:
     - If the encoded value is less than 28, it assigns 1 to the position and subtracts 1 from the encoded value.
     - If the encoded value is between 28 and 51, it assigns 26 to the position and subtracts 26 from the encoded value.
     - If the encoded value is between 52 and 78, it assigns 26 to the position and subtracts 26 from the encoded value.
   - The third position is filled with the remaining encoded value.
   - The array is then sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - The positions are converted to letters and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for First Two Letters**:
   - The logic for assigning values to the first two positions is flawed. It does not correctly handle the distribution of the encoded value to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
   - For example, if the encoded value is 24, the program might assign 1, 1, and 22 instead of 1, 1, and 22, which is correct, but the way it handles other values is incorrect.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the encoded value is 3, it should output "aaa", which it does correctly. However, for other values, the logic fails to produce the correct result.

### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case `n = 55`:
- The program might assign values like 26, 26, and 3, which corresponds to "zzc". However, the correct answer should be "czz".

### Correct Approach:
To ensure the lexicographically smallest word, the program should distribute the encoded value in such a way that the first letter is as small as possible, then the second, and finally the third. This can be done by iteratively assigning the smallest possible values to each letter while ensuring the sum equals the encoded value.

### Revised Function Summary:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 78) and computes the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded by distributing the encoded value across the three letters in ascending order.

### Correct Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        n -= 3  # Subtract the minimum value (1+1+1)
        # Distribute the remaining value to b and c first, then a if needed
        if n > 25:
            b += 25
            n -= 25
        else:
            b += n
            n = 0
        if n > 0:
            c += n
        # Convert to letters
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(word)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly handle the decoding logic to ensure the lexicographically smallest word for all possible encoded values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**.
