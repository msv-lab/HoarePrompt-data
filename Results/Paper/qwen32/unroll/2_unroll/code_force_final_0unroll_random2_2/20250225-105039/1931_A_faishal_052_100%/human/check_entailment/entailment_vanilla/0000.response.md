Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:** An integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
2. **Output:** For each `n`, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n`.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each `n`, the program attempts to construct a three-letter word.
   - The logic for constructing the word is flawed.

3. **Constructing the Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` and then tries to fill it with values based on the value of `lex` (which is initially `n`).
   - The program checks if `lex` is less than 28 or 52 and appends either 1 or 26 to `arr` accordingly.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.
   - After appending values, the program appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr` and sorts the list.
   - Sorting the list does not guarantee a lexicographically smallest word because the smallest letter should come first, not just the smallest values.

4. **Generating the Output:**
   - The program converts each value in `arr` to a character and concatenates them to form the word.
   - This part is correct in terms of converting numbers to letters, but the input values in `arr` are incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a') and increment them until the sum matches `n`.
- This ensures that the word is as small as possible in lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for each `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
