To determine the output state, we need to analyze the loop and how it processes each test case. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `cases` times.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, an inner loop runs twice. Inside this loop, it checks the value of `lex`:
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
3. **Post Inner Loop**: After the inner loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.
4. **Sorting**: The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
5. **Appending to Info**: The sorted list `arr` is appended to the `info` list.

Let's consider a few examples to understand the output state:

- **Case 1**: If `lex` is 10:
  - First inner loop: `lex` < 28 → `arr` = [1], `lex` = 9
  - Second inner loop: `lex` < 28 → `arr` = [1, 1], `lex` = 8
  - Post inner loop: `arr` = [1, 1, 8]
  - Sorted `arr` = [1, 1, 8]
  - `info` = [[1, 1, 8]]

- **Case 2**: If `lex` is 30:
  - First inner loop: `lex` < 28 → `arr` = [1], `lex` = 29
  - Second inner loop: `lex` < 52 → `arr` = [1, 26], `lex` = 3
  - Post inner loop: `arr` = [1, 26, 3]
  - Sorted `arr` = [1, 3, 26]
  - `info` = [[1, 1, 8], [1, 3, 26]]

- **Case 3**: If `lex` is 60:
  - First inner loop: `lex` < 52 → `arr` = [26], `lex` = 34
  - Second inner loop: `lex` < 52 → `arr` = [26, 26], `lex` = 8
  - Post inner loop: `arr` = [26, 26, 8]
  - Sorted `arr` = [8, 26, 26]
  - `info` = [[1, 1, 8], [1, 3, 26], [8, 26, 26]]

- **Case 4**: If `lex` is 78:
  - First inner loop: `lex` < 52 → `arr` = [26], `lex` = 52
  - Second inner loop: `lex` < 52 → `arr` = [26, 26], `lex` = 0
  - Post inner loop: `arr` = [26, 26, 0]
  - Sorted `arr` = [0, 26, 26]
  - `info` = [[1, 1, 8], [1, 3, 26], [8, 26, 26], [0, 26, 26]]

Given the above logic, the output state will depend on the specific values of `lex` for each of the `cases`. However, the format of the output state will be a list of lists (`info`), where each inner list contains three integers sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`info` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three integers sorted in ascending order, representing the processed values for each test case.**
