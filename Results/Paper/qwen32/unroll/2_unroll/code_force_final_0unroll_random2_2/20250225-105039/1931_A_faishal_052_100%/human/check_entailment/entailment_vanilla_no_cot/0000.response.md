Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**: The program incorrectly handles the remaining value of `lex` after assigning the first two letters. It should ensure that the remaining value is valid (between 1 and 26) and correctly assigns it to the third letter.
2. **Sorting the Letters**: The program sorts the letters after assigning them, which does not ensure a lexicographically smallest word. The letters should be assigned in such a way that they are already in lexicographically smallest order.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the encoded value is close to the minimum or maximum possible values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters 'aaa'
        a = b = c = 1
        # Distribute the remaining value after assigning 'aaa'
        n -= 3
        # Assign the remaining value to the letters in a way that keeps them lexicographically smallest
        if n > 0:
            if n >= 25:  # Can we make 'b' a 'z'?
                b += 25
                n -= 25
            else:
                b += n
                n = 0
        if n > 0:
            c += n
        # Convert the values to letters
        word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(word)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the letters are assigned in a way that maintains the lexicographically smallest order and correctly handles the distribution of the encoded value.
