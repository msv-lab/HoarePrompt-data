To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over each test case (each inner list in `info`), converts each integer in the inner list to a corresponding lowercase letter by adding 96 to the integer (since 'a' corresponds to ASCII value 97), and then concatenates these letters into a string. This string is then printed.

Since the loop prints the result rather than modifying the `info` list, the `info` list itself remains unchanged. The output state, therefore, refers to the printed output, not a change in the `info` list.

However, since the question asks for the output state in a format similar to the initial execution state, and since the `info` list is not modified, the output state in terms of the `info` list remains the same.

Thus, the output state in the format requested is:

Output State: **info is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three integers sorted in ascending order, representing the processed values for each test case.**
