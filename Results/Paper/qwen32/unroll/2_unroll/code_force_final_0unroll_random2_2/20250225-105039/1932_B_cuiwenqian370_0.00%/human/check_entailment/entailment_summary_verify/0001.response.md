Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be designed to process a string path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur. It calculates some kind of score based on the path, but this has no relevance to the problem at hand.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute a result for each test case. However, since `func_1` is not solving the correct problem, the results produced by `func_2` are also incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach**: As outlined in the original assessment, the correct approach involves:
   - Reading the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a_i`.
   - Initializing the current year to 0.
   - For each sign, finding the next occurrence year after the current year.
   - Updating the current year to this next occurrence year.
   - Repeating until all signs have occurred.
   - Outputting the year in which the last sign occurs.

The provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it attempts to solve a different problem related to some path with '@' and '*' characters.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
