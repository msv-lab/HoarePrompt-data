### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of each sign.
   - The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign must occur after the (i-1)-th sign.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - This function is designed to count the maximum number of '@' characters in a sequence, considering certain constraints ('*').
     - It does not incorporate the logic required to find the year in which each sign occurs based on its periodicity.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - This function reads input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It calls `func_1` with a path (which is not defined in the problem context) and collects results.
     - The results are then printed, but they do not correspond to the years in which the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, iterate through each sign and find the next occurrence year based on its periodicity, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.
   - The correct implementation provided in the original assessment calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case based on the periodicities provided.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
