You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of path is a non-negative integer n.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except `dp[0]` which is `-inf` if the first element of `path` is '*'.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except `dp[0]` which is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', and `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 1; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except `dp[0]` which is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', and `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'; if the second character of `path` is '*', `dp[1]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[1]` is `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except `dp[0]` which is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', and `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'. If `n` is greater than 1, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: dp is a list where each element represents the maximum number of '@' characters encountered up to that position in path, with -inf indicating an impossible path due to '*'.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum number of '@' characters encountered up to any position in the path, excluding positions marked as impossible ('*').
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`. The function returns 0 if the path contains no '@' characters or only '*' characters. Otherwise, it returns the maximum number of '@' characters encountered up to any position in the path, excluding positions marked as impossible ('*').

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum number of '@' characters encountered up to any position in the path, excluding positions marked as impossible ('*').


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
