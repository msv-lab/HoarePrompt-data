Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`; `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 1; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except `dp[0]` which is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', and `-inf` if the first character of `path` is '*'; `dp[1]` is `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`.**

In simpler terms: The `path` list remains unchanged. The value of `n` (length of `path`) remains unchanged and is greater than 1. The `dp` list's first element (`dp[0]`) remains unchanged, being 1 if the first character of `path` is '@' and `-inf` if it is '*'. The second element of `dp` (`dp[1]`) is updated to be the value of `dp[0]` plus 1 if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise, it remains the same as `dp[0]`.
