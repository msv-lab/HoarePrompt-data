### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to determine if it meets the requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. The sequence `a` must not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.
3. The sequence `a` should have a size of at most 25.

#### Program Analysis:
The program generates a sequence based on powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\) (which is 1,048,576) and then modifies it to ensure the conditions are met.

1. **Generating Initial Sequence**:
   - `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]` generates a list of the first 21 powers of 2, i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than `k`**:
   - The loop iterates through `nums` to find the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. This index is stored in `idx`.

3. **Modifying the Sequence**:
   - The program then appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - It removes `nums[idx]` from the list.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of this list.

#### Correctness Verification:
- **Condition 1 (No subsequence sums to `k`)**:
  - By removing `nums[idx]` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that no combination of the elements in `nums` can sum to `k`.
  
- **Condition 2 (All `v` from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed)**:
  - The initial sequence of powers of 2 allows the formation of all sums that are sums of distinct powers of 2 (which are all numbers that can be represented in binary with 1s and 0s).
  - The modifications ensure that `k` cannot be formed, but other sums are still possible. The specific modifications (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`) are designed to avoid `k` while still allowing other sums.

- **Condition 3 (Size of sequence at most 25)**:
  - The initial sequence has 21 elements. After adding 3 more and removing 1, the final sequence has 23 elements, which is within the limit.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets all the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
