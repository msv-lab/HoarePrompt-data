Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of determining if Bob can set up his jewelry store with at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. The program includes a function `func_1` that is supposed to handle the logic for each test case.

However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Stall Prices:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `costs` with two values `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then attempts to use these values to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels. This logic is flawed and does not correctly simulate the greedy behavior of Alice or ensure that she buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The loop that calculates `h` (the total number of jewels Alice can buy) and modifies `n` by subtracting the cost of jewels bought is incorrect. The logic does not account for the fact that Alice will continue to the next stall and buy as many jewels as possible at that stall's price.

2. **Incorrect Output Format:**
   - When the function prints "YES", it should also print the number of stalls `s` and the prices `p1, p2, ..., ps`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this.
   - The function prints "YES" and "NO" in incorrect positions and formats.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not correctly handle cases where `n == k` or `n < k`. While it correctly prints "YES" when `n == k` and "NO" when `n < k`, it does not provide the correct stall setup in the "YES" case.

4. **Lack of Implementation for General Case:**
   - The function does not provide a general solution for setting up the stalls and their prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current implementation only handles a very specific and incorrect case.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem as described. The logic for determining stall prices and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed, and the output format is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
