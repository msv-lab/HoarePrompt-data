Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, and return the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \), where \( \frac{p}{q} \) is the expected value expressed as a fraction in simplest form.

2. **Key Points**:
   - There are \( n \) children and \( m \) pairs of friends.
   - Each friend pair has an initial friendship value.
   - For each of the \( k \) excursions, a pair of children is chosen randomly.
   - If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all chosen pairs.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - For each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen in \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \), because there are \( \binom{n}{2} \) possible pairs.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen, starting from its initial value.
   - The expected contribution of a friend pair to the total sum is the sum of the expected values of its friendship value over the \( k \) excursions.
   - The expected friendship value after \( x \) excursions for a pair with initial value \( f \) is \( f + \frac{x(x+1)}{2 \binom{n}{2}} \).

4. **Simplification**:
   - The problem simplifies to calculating the sum of the expected contributions of all friend pairs.
   - The expected contribution of a single friend pair can be calculated as \( f \cdot k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Since the problem asks for the result modulo \( 10^9+7 \), we need to handle the division carefully by using modular inverses.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected contribution of all friend pairs.
   - It sums up \( f \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) for all friend pairs.
   - The term \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) is calculated once and used for all friend pairs.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Missing Modular Inverse**:
   - The program does not account for the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \) in the expected value calculation.
   - The correct expected contribution of a friend pair should be \( f \cdot k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) needs to be calculated using the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the expected value by not including the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \).

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \) in the expected value calculation.

Correctness: **False**
