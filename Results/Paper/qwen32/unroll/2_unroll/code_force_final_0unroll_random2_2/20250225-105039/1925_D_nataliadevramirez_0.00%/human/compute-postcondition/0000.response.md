The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input does not affect the initial state of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `friendships`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `t` has been assigned a new integer value, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of children, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions, `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing a pair of friends and their friendship value, and `t` is the input integer.**
