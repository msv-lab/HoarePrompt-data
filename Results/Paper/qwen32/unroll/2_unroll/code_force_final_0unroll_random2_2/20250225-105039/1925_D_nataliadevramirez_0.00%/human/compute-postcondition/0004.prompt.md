You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value. It is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `t` will be 0 (since the loop will have finished executing). The results of `func_1` for each iteration will have been printed, but these results are not stored in any variable in the provided code snippet.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` represents the number of children, `m` represents the number of pairs of friends, and `k` represents the number of excursions. Additionally, it accepts a list of lists `friendships` where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing a pair of friends and their friendship value. The function returns a value or values based on the given constraints and inputs, likely related to organizing excursions among the children considering their friendships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
