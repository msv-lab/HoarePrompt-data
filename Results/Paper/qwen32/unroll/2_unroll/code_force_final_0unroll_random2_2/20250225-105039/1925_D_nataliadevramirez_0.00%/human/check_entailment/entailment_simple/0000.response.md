### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and then compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It takes four parameters: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (list of friendships with their initial friendship values).
   - It calculates the sum of the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends is calculated as \(f \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\), where \(f\) is the initial friendship value of the pair.
   - The result is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
  - The provided program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values as \(f \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\) for each pair. This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
  - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
  - Therefore, the expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value \(f\) to the total sum over `k` excursions is \(f \cdot k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\), not \(f \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\).

- **Incorrect Handling of Fraction and Modulo:**
  - The program should compute the expected value as a fraction and then find the modular inverse of the denominator to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
  - The current implementation does not handle the fraction and its modular inverse correctly.

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
