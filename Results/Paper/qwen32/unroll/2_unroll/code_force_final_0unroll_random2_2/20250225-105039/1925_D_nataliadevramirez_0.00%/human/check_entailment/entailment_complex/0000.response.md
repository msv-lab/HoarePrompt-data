### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\dfrac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and then computing \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

Let's break down the provided functions and check if they correctly meet the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of the product of each friendship value and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, modulo `MOD`.
   - **Implementation**:
     - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\).
     - For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, the contribution to the result is \(f \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\).
     - The result is accumulated and taken modulo `MOD`.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly calculates the sum of the expected friendship values for all pairs of friends. However, it does not handle the case where not all pairs are friends. The expected value should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\). The current implementation does not account for this probability, which is a crucial part of the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Read multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and a list of friendships with their respective values. For each test case, it computes and prints a result.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
     - Reads `m` lines of friendships, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.
     - Calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. However, since `func_1` does not correctly account for the probability of choosing a friend pair, the overall result is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided implementation does not correctly account for the probability of choosing a friend pair during the excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
