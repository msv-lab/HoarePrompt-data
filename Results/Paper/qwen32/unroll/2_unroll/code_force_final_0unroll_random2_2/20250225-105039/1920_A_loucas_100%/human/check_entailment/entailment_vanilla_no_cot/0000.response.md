Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid integers `k` is flawed. Here are a few issues:

1. The program calculates `num` as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This calculation assumes that there are no "not equal" constraints between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, which may not be the case.

2. The program does not correctly handle cases where the "not equal" constraints fall outside the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. The current logic subtracts 1 from `num` for each "not equal" constraint that falls within the range, but it does not account for the possibility that some "not equal" constraints might fall outside the range, which should not affect the count.

3. The program does not handle the possibility of multiple "not equal" constraints within the range `[max(big), min(less)]` correctly. It simply subtracts 1 for each such constraint, but if there are multiple constraints for the same value, it should only subtract 1 for each unique value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()  # Using a set to avoid duplicate "not equal" constraints
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        min_less = min(less)
        max_big = max(big)
        num = max(0, min_less - max_big + 1 - len(no.intersection(range(max_big, min_less + 1))))
        print(num)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program uses a set to store "not equal" constraints to avoid duplicates. It calculates `num` as the difference between `min_less` and `max_big` plus 1, and then subtracts the number of "not equal" constraints that fall within the range `[max_big, min_less]`.
