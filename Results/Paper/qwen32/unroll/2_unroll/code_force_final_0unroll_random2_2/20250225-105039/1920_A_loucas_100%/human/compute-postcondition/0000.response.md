The code snippet `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The initial state provides information about `t`, `n`, and constraints, but these are not affected by this particular line of code. The only variable that changes is `loop`, which takes on the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. All pairs (a, x) are distinct. `loop` is an input integer.**
