Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

    distances = []
    for node in nodes[start]:

#Function 2:

    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []

    #State: `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and the value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes, populated with the edges provided as input; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`.

        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and the value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is the integer input provided by the user; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) from the `nodes` dictionary. If `moves` is truthy (i.e., not empty or zero), the program proceeds accordingly. If `moves` is `False`, the program also proceeds accordingly with `moves` being `False`.
