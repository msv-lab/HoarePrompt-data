Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and the value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is the integer input provided by the user; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) from the `nodes` dictionary. If `moves` is truthy (i.e., not empty or zero), the program proceeds accordingly. If `moves` is `False`, the program also proceeds accordingly with `moves` being `False`.**
