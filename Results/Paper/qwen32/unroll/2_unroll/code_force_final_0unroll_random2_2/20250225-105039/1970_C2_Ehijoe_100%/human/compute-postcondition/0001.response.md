The code snippet initializes an empty list named `edges`. The other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, and `t`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and the value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list.**
