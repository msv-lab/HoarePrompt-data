Functionality: **The function reads input to construct a graph represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, identifies leaf nodes, and determines the starting node. It then calls another function `func_1` to process the graph starting from the given node. Based on the result from `func_1`, it prints either "Ron" or "Hermione".**
