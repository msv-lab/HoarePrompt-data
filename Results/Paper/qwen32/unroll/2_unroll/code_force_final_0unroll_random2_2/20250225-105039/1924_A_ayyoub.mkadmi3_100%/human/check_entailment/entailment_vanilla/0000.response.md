Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of a given string `s`. If not, one such string that is not a subsequence should be provided.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it processes the input string `s` to determine if it contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters of the English alphabet.

#### Key Components of the Program
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s`.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   - It iterates over the string `s`, and for each character, if it is in the alphabet set, it removes the character from the set.
   - If the set becomes empty, it resets the set and appends the character to `s2`.
   - It constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the alphabet set.
   - It then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a boolean indicating this, along with `s1` and `s2`.

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function is supposed to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`, but the current implementation does not correctly achieve this. The function does not actually check for all possible subsequences; it just checks if the string `s` contains all `k` characters enough times.
2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence**: The program attempts to construct a missing subsequence if the function returns `False`. However, the logic used is incorrect. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using that character, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Output**: The program outputs 'No' and 'Yes' in lowercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement, but the logic to determine the missing subsequence is flawed.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`, and the logic to construct a missing subsequence is flawed.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
