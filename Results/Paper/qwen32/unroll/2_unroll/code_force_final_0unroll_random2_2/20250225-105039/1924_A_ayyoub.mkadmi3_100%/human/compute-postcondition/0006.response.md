Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.**

To break it down:
- The first element is a boolean value that is `True` if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, otherwise `False`.
- The second element is the substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of the string.
- The third element is the string `s2`, which contains the last `k-1` characters of `s`.
