The value of `r` is assigned the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. Since `s1` is the same as `s`, `len(s1)` is the length of `s`. Therefore, `r` will be the integer division of `len(s)` by `k`. The values of `s2` and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is the same as `s`, `s2` contains the last `k-1` characters of `s`, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `r` is `len(s) // k`.**
