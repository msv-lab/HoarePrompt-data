### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in the given string `s`. If not, it must provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

Let's break down the program's logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates over the string `s` and constructs `s1` which is essentially `s` itself.
   - It also constructs `s2` which is supposed to contain the last `k-1` characters of `s` but the logic here is flawed. The code does not correctly build `s2` to represent the last `k-1` characters but instead appends characters when the alphabet set is reduced to one element.
   - The function returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)` where `r` is `len(s1) // k`. This logic is incorrect because it does not properly check for the existence of all possible subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Post-Function Logic:**
   - If the boolean value returned by `func_1` is `False`, the program tries to find a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.
   - It iterates through the alphabet to find a character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using this character.
   - If the boolean value is `True`, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:** The function does not correctly determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s`. It incorrectly constructs `s2` and does not properly check for the existence of all subsequences.
- **Incorrect Handling of `s2`:** The variable `s2` is not correctly used to determine the missing subsequence.
- **Flawed Subsequence Check:** The program does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic of `func_1` and the incorrect handling of subsequences, the program is not correct as per the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
