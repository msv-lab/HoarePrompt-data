You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m, where m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be checked as subsequences. k and n are integers such that the strings are formed using only the first k lowercase English alphabets.

    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, returning a tuple with a boolean indicating if the length of `s` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s` starting from a calculated index, and a string `s2` which contains characters based on the removal logic within the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of a given string `s`. If not, one such string that is not a subsequence should be provided.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it processes the input string `s` to determine if it contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters of the English alphabet.

#### Key Components of the Program
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s`.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   - It iterates over the string `s`, and for each character, if it is in the alphabet set, it removes the character from the set.
   - If the set becomes empty, it resets the set and appends the character to `s2`.
   - It constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the alphabet set.
   - It then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a boolean indicating this, along with `s1` and `s2`.

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function is supposed to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`, but the current implementation does not correctly achieve this. The function does not actually check for all possible subsequences; it just checks if the string `s` contains all `k` characters enough times.
2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence**: The program attempts to construct a missing subsequence if the function returns `False`. However, the logic used is incorrect. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using that character, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Output**: The program outputs 'No' and 'Yes' in lowercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement, but the logic to determine the missing subsequence is flawed.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`, and the logic to construct a missing subsequence is flawed.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
