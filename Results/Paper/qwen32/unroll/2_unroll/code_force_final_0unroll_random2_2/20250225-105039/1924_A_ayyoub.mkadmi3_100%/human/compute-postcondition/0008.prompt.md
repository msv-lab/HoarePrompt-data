You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m, where m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be checked as subsequences. k and n are integers such that the strings are formed using only the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function is called for each test case, and the sum of m and n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: `s1` is the same as `s`, `s2` contains the last `k-1` characters of `s`, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, an integer `k` representing the number of distinct alphabets used, and an integer `n` representing the length of the strings to be checked as subsequences. The function returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`. However, based on the provided output description, it seems `s2` is not defined in the output details, so it might be a placeholder or an error in the description. Assuming `s2` is not part of the expected output, the function returns a boolean and the substring of `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
