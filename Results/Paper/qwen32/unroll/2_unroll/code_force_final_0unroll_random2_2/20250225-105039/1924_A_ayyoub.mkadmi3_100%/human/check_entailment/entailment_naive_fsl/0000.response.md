Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and find a specific case where it fails.

The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly handle the problem requirements.

Hereâ€™s a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

### Expected Output:
```
NO
aaa
```

### Explanation of the Expected Output:
The string `s` is `aabbccabab`. We need to check if all possible strings of length 3 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`a`, `b`, `c`) occur as subsequences in `s`. Some of these strings are `aaa`, `aab`, `aac`, `aba`, `abc`, etc. The string `aaa` does not occur as a subsequence in `s`, so the correct output should be `NO` followed by `aaa`.

### Actual Output of the Program:
The provided program will not output `aaa` as the missing subsequence. Instead, it will likely output a different string, such as `aab` or `aba`, because the logic in `func_1` does not correctly identify the missing subsequence.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
The function `func_1` has several issues:
1. It does not correctly check all possible subsequences of length `n`.
2. The logic for constructing the missing subsequence is flawed.
3. It does not ensure that the missing subsequence is the first one that does not appear in `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence in `s`. If we find a string that is not a subsequence, we output `NO` followed by that string.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect for at least one potential case, so the correctness is **False**.
