### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` in detail to confirm the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are present in the string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such subsequence that is not present.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s`.
2. **Function `func_1`**: The function is supposed to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. Let's break down the function:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   - **Iteration and Removal**: For each character in `s`, if it is in the alphabet set, it removes the character from the set. If the set becomes empty, it resets the set and appends the character to `s2`. It also constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the alphabet set.
   - **Check Length**: It then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a boolean indicating this, along with `s1` and `s2`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. The function merely checks if the string `s` contains all `k` characters enough times, which is not sufficient to confirm the presence of all possible subsequences.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the possible subsequences are `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`. The function `func_1` does not verify if all these subsequences are present in `s`.

2. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence**:
   - The program attempts to construct a missing subsequence if the function returns `False`. However, the logic used is incorrect. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using that character, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "abb"` and `n = 2`, `k = 2`, the function might incorrectly identify `cc` as a missing subsequence when `aa` is actually the correct one.

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`, and the logic to construct a missing subsequence is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
