You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to create a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`, and the bitwise OR of these integers should have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k` because there's only one number in the sequence.
4. For `n > 1`, it attempts to create a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence:
   - It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
   - It appends `(1 << i) - 1` to the sequence, where `i` is the index of the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It appends the remaining value (`k - sum(ans)`) to the sequence.
   - It fills the rest of the sequence with zeros to make its length `n`.

### Flaws in the Program:
The program does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. Here's why:

- The program only uses one large number (`(1 << i) - 1`) and the remaining value. This approach does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.
- For example, in the test case `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the program might output `3 2` (where `3` is `11` in binary and `2` is `10` in binary, resulting in a bitwise OR of `11` which has 2 ones). However, the optimal solution could be `1 4` (where `1` is `01` in binary and `4` is `100` in binary, resulting in a bitwise OR of `101` which has 3 ones).

### Correctness:
Given the flaws identified, the program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
