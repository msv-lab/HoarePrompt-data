To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given the problem statement, `t` represents the number of test cases, and `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` should return a value that is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Input Value**: The loop will execute `int(input())` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be at least 1.
2. **State Adjustment**: Since `t` is already given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns `t`. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input to `int(input())` is `t`.

The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` will return `t`, which is already given to be within the valid range.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `int(input())` returns `t`**.

Since the loop head only involves the input, and we are given that `t` is already correctly defined within the valid range, the state does not need further adjustment for the loop to execute.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
