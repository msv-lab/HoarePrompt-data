You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

The program works as follows:
1. For a single integer (n = 1), it correctly outputs k.
2. For multiple integers (n > 1), it calculates the highest power of 2 less than k, subtracts it from k, and appends the result and zeros to the sequence.

However, this approach does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized. The program should aim to distribute the sum k among the n integers in such a way that the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 7
```

**Expected Output:**
A sequence of 3 integers that sum to 7 and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. One possible correct output is:
```
3 4 0
```
Explanation:
- `3` in binary is `11`
- `4` in binary is `100`
- `0` in binary is `0`
- Bitwise OR of `3 | 4 | 0` is `111` which has 3 ones.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
3 4 0
```
This output is correct for this specific case, but let's consider another example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 10
```

**Expected Output:**
A sequence of 4 integers that sum to 10 and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. One possible correct output is:
```
2 2 4 2
```
Explanation:
- `2` in binary is `10`
- `2` in binary is `10`
- `4` in binary is `100`
- `2` in binary is `10`
- Bitwise OR of `2 | 2 | 4 | 2` is `110` which has 2 ones.

However, the program might output something like:
```
7 3 0 0
```
Explanation:
- `7` in binary is `111`
- `3` in binary is `11`
- `0` in binary is `0`
- `0` in binary is `0`
- Bitwise OR of `7 | 3 | 0 | 0` is `111` which has 3 ones, but this is not the only possible output, and it might not be optimal for all cases.

The program does not always distribute the sum optimally to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Counterexample:**
```
1
4 10
```
Expected output: `2 2 4 2` (or any other sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR)
Actual output: `7 3 0 0` (or any other suboptimal sequence)

Thus, the program is incorrect.
