### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, let's break down the problem and the approach taken by the program step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - **Sum Calculation:** The program calculates the sum of the array `s`.
   - **Maximum Positive Subarray Sum:** The program calculates the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray `t` using Kadane's algorithm.
   - **Initial Answer:** The initial answer is set as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum:** The program then doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` in each of the remaining `k-1` operations and adds it to the answer, taking modulo `MOD` at each step.

3. **Key Points:**
   - **Kadane's Algorithm:** This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, which is crucial for maximizing the sum of the array after operations.
   - **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum:** By doubling the maximum subarray sum in each operation, the program effectively maximizes the contribution of the positive parts of the array to the final sum.
   - **Handling Negative Sums:** If the sum of the array is negative, the program ensures that the answer is correctly computed by adding the maximum subarray sum `t` and then doubling it, which helps in getting a positive sum if possible.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Negative Elements:** If all elements are negative, the maximum subarray sum `t` will be `0`, and the result will be the sum of the array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Single Element Array:** The program handles this case correctly by calculating the maximum subarray sum and doubling it as necessary.
   - **Multiple Test Cases:** The program iterates over multiple test cases and handles each one independently, which is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program follows the optimal strategy of maximizing the sum by leveraging the maximum subarray sum and doubling it in each operation.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the strategy to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
