### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation consists of selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum after all operations, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `MOD` to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It reads the number of test cases `T`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the list `a`.
   - It calculates the maximum subarray sum `t` using a variation of Kadane's algorithm. This is done by iterating through the list `a` and maintaining a running sum `tmp` that resets to 0 if it becomes negative. The maximum value of `tmp` during this process is stored in `t`.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The initial result `ans` is calculated as \((s + t) \mod MOD\).
   - For \(k-1\) iterations, `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, with the result taken modulo `MOD` after each addition.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Sum Calculation (`s`)**: The sum `s` is the sum of all elements in the array, which is a valid starting point for the maximum sum.
- **Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**: The maximum subarray sum `t` is calculated using Kadane's algorithm, which correctly identifies the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
- **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**: The program correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for \(k-1\) iterations and adds it to the initial result `ans`. This doubling reflects the fact that the maximum subarray sum can be repeatedly added to the array through the operations, thereby maximizing the total sum.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, taking into account the modulo constraint. Therefore, the program is correct.
