Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem description in all cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero, which is a key requirement.

Let's analyze the program with a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input `x = 2`. According to the problem description, a valid output could be:
```
2
1 0
```
This is because \(1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0 = 2\).

However, if we run the provided program with `x = 2`, it might produce:
```
2
1 1
```
This output is incorrect because it violates the condition that no two consecutive elements in the array can be non-zero.

To further illustrate, let's consider the input `x = 3`. A valid output could be:
```
3
1 0 1
```
This is because \(1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5\).

However, if we run the provided program with `x = 3`, it might produce:
```
2
1 1
```
This output is incorrect for `x = 3` because it violates the condition that no two consecutive elements in the array can be non-zero.

The program seems to have logical issues in handling the conversion of the integer `x` into the required array format, especially in ensuring that no two consecutive elements are non-zero. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
