### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Binary Conversion**:
   - The program starts by converting the integer `x` into its binary representation by iterating through the first 30 bits (since `x < 2^30`).
   - It initializes an empty list `s` and fills it with '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set or not.

2. **Adjusting for Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The program then goes through the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero (either '1' or '-1').
   - If two consecutive '1's are found, it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets a flag to indicate that the next element should be '0'.
   - If a '0' is found and the flag is set, it changes the '0' to '1' and resets the flag.
   - This process continues until the end of the list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the flag is still set after processing the first 29 bits and the 30th bit is '0', it changes the 30th bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the 30th bit is '1', it changes the 30th bit to '0' and appends an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program checks for any occurrence where a '-1' is immediately preceded by a '1' and swaps them to ensure the condition that no two consecutive elements are non-zero is maintained.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the length of the list and the list itself.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly ensures that no two consecutive elements in the list are non-zero.
  - It handles cases where the binary representation of `x` has consecutive '1's by introducing '-1' and adjusting the list accordingly.
  - The final adjustment step ensures that the condition is maintained even in edge cases.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where the binary representation of `x` has consecutive '1's and needs to introduce '-1'.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the 30th bit is '0' or '1' and adjusts the list length accordingly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correctly implementing the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
