To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
    - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `times` is an input integer; `check` is 2147483647.
    - `check` is reset to 2^31 - 1 at the beginning of each loop iteration, which is 2147483647.

2. **Loop Execution:**
    - The loop runs `times` number of times.
    - For each iteration:
        - `n` is read as an integer, representing the number of elements in the list `data`.
        - `data` is a list of integers read from the input.
        - `dic` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
        - `ans` is initialized to `n`.
        - For each element `i` in `data`:
            - `s` is calculated as `i ^ check` (bitwise XOR operation with `check`).
            - If `s` is in `dic`, it means `i ^ check` was previously encountered:
                - Decrement the count of `s` in `dic`.
                - Decrement `ans` by 1.
                - If the count of `s` in `dic` becomes zero, remove `s` from `dic`.
            - If `i` is in `dic`, it means `i` was previously encountered:
                - Increment the count of `i` in `dic`.
            - If neither `s` nor `i` is in `dic`, add `i` to `dic` with a count of 1.
            - Print the current value of `ans`.

3. **Output State Analysis:**
    - After each iteration of the outer loop, `ans` is printed for each element in `data`. The final value of `ans` in each iteration will be the number of elements in `data` that do not have a matching `i ^ check` or `i` in the dictionary `dic`.
    - Since `check` is reset to 2147483647 at the beginning of each iteration, the state of `check` remains unchanged from the initial state after all iterations.
    - The variables `t` and `times` are not modified within the loop and remain unchanged.
    - The variable `ans` will be different for each iteration based on the input data, but it does not persist across iterations.

Given the above analysis, the output state after all iterations will be the same as the initial state for `t` and `times`, and `check` will remain 2147483647. The variable `ans` is not retained outside the loop iterations and will not be part of the final output state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; times is an input integer; check is 2147483647.**
