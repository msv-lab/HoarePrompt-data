t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each of the m queries, there are two integers x_i and y_i such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is uniquely determined.
