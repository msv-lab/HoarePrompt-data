The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is typically used to read multiple integers from a single line of input efficiently.

Given the initial state, the code does not change any existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and the queries) but introduces a new function `r` for future use.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, there are two integers `x_i` and `y_i` such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
