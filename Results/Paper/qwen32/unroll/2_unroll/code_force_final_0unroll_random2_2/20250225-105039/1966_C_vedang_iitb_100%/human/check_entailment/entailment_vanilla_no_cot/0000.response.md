Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and optimal play by both players. The key to solving this problem lies in the concept of the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes, which is a common technique in combinatorial game theory for impartial games like this one.

Here's a brief explanation of the correct approach:

1. **Nim-sum Calculation**: Calculate the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If the XOR is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy, assuming both play optimally.

2. **Why XOR?**: The XOR operation helps in determining the Grundy number (or Nimber) of the game state. If the Grundy number is non-zero, there is a move that can be made to reach a state with a Grundy number of zero, which is a losing position for the opponent if they play optimally.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            nim_sum ^= sz
        if nim_sum != 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

# Example usage
func()
```

This program correctly calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes for each test case and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or non-zero.
