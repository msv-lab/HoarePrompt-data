Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. Based on the input, the function performs some internal logic to determine the outcome and either prints 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The function can return `None` in some cases after printing the result. Specifically, Case_1 and Case_3 result in the function printing 'Bob' and returning `None`, Case_2 results in printing 'Alice' and returning `None`, and Case_4 results in returning 'Alice'.**
