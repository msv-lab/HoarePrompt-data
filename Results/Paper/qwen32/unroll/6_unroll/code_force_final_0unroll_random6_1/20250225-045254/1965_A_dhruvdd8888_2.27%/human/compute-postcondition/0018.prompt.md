You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns None and prints 'Alice'
    #State: `N` is assigned the value of the first integer input; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the split first line input, and the length of `nums` is greater than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None
    #State: `N` is assigned the value of the first integer input; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the split first line input, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: N is the first integer input; nums is a sorted list of integers derived from the split first line input, with 0 inserted at the beginning; cd is the count of consecutive elements in nums that differ by 1, starting from the beginning of the list.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns None after printing 'Bob'
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns Alice
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. Based on the input, the function performs some internal logic to determine the outcome and either prints 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The function can return `None` in some cases after printing the result. Specifically, Case_1 and Case_3 result in the function printing 'Bob' and returning `None`, Case_2 results in printing 'Alice' and returning `None`, and Case_4 results in returning 'Alice'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None and prints 'Alice'

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None

Case_3: The program returns None after printing 'Bob'

Case_4: The program returns Alice


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
