Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a list of integers (`s`), which is expected to be a binary string, but it's being read as integers without any conversion or validation.
   - It then counts the number of 1s (`n`) encountered so far.
   - Whenever a 0 is encountered after any 1s, it adds `n + 1` to the cumulative cost (`ans`).
   - This logic does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed operations.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `11000`, the correct minimum cost is 9, but the function `func_1` would not compute this correctly. The function would add 2 for the first 0 (after 11), 3 for the second 0 (after 110), and 4 for the third 0 (after 1100), resulting in a total cost of 9, which is correct for this specific example but not due to the logic implemented.
   - However, this logic does not generalize to all cases. For example, for the input `101011`, the correct minimum cost is 5, but the function `func_1` would compute a different cost.

3. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases (`t`) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program is incorrect.

The given code does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the minimum cost to sort the binary strings using the allowed cyclic shift operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
