The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which is used to determine the number of iterations of the loop. To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The loop will not execute if `t` is 0 or negative.

Since the loop body is omitted, the state of `t` is the only thing we need to adjust to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
