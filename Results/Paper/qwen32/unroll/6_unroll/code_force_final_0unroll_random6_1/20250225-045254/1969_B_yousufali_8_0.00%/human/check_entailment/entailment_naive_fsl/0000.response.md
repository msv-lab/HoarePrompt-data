Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

The function `func_1` is designed to process a single binary string and calculate the cost. However, it incorrectly assumes that every time a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's, the cost is the length of the sequence of '1's plus one. This assumption is incorrect and does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
1101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To sort the string "1101" into "0111", one optimal strategy is:
1. Choose substring [1, 3]: "1101" -> "0111". The cost is 3.

However, the provided program will output a different result because it does not correctly calculate the cost based on the optimal cyclic shifts.

**Program Output:**
```
3
```

While this specific case might coincidentally produce the correct result, the logic is flawed and will fail for other cases. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
111000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To sort the string "111000" into "000111", one optimal strategy is:
1. Choose substring [1, 3]: "111000" -> "101100". The cost is 3.
2. Choose substring [2, 4]: "101100" -> "100110". The cost is 3.
3. Choose substring [3, 5]: "100110" -> "100011". The cost is 3.

The total cost is 9.

**Program Output:**
```
6
```

Thus, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem and fails for at least one input case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
