Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`:** This function processes a single binary string. It iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of 1s encountered so far (`n`). Whenever a 0 is encountered and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the cumulative cost (`ans`). This logic is based on the idea that each 0 encountered after some 1s needs to "push" those 1s to the right, incurring a cost equal to the number of 1s plus one.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then calls `func_1` for each test case.

However, there is a significant issue in the program: the input reading in `func_1` is incorrect. The function `func_1` reads a list of integers using `input().split()`, which is not suitable for reading a binary string. The correct approach would be to read the string directly and then process it.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement. For the input `11000`, the program should output `9`. However, with the current implementation, `func_1` would not work as intended because it expects a list of integers, not a string. The intended logic is correct, but the input handling is flawed.

To fix the program, `func_1` should be modified to read a string directly:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string directly
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program would correctly handle the input and produce the expected output.

Correctness: **False** (due to incorrect input handling in `func_1`).
