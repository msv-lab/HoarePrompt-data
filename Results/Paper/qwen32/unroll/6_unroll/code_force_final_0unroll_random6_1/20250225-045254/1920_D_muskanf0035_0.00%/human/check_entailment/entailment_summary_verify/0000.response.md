### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We start with an empty array `a`.
- Operations:
  1. Append an integer `x` to the end of `a`.
  2. Append `x` copies of `a` to the end of `a`.
- Queries ask for the `k`-th element of `a` after all operations.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, operations, queries)`: This function processes the operations and queries for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input for multiple test cases, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

#### Key Issue in the Code:
The problematic line in `func_1` is:
```python
array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```
This line doubles the array, regardless of the value of `x`. The correct behavior should be to extend the array by appending `x` copies of itself.

#### Correct Behavior:
For an operation of type 2 with value `x`, the array should be extended by appending `x` copies of itself. This means:
- If `x = 1`, the array remains unchanged.
- If `x = 2`, the array doubles.
- If `x = 3`, the array becomes `[a, a, a]`, and so on.

#### Corrected Code:
The line should be modified to:
```python
array.extend(array * (value - 1))
```
This ensures that the array is extended by `x` copies of itself.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the code. The provided code does not correctly handle the second type of operation, as it only doubles the array instead of repeating it `x` times.

#### Conclusion:
Given the identified issue and the need for a correction, the original assessment is accurate. The program as provided is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
