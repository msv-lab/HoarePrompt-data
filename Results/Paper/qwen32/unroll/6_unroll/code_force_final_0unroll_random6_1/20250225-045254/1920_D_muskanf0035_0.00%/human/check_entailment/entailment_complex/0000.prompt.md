Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

# Annotated Functions:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 <= x <= n for b=1, x >= 1 for b=2), and queries is a list of integers where each integer k satisfies 1 <= k <= len(array) after all operations are performed.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples, queries is a list of integers, array is the final modified list after all operations, result is an empty list.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes, `result` will contain elements from `array` at positions determined by the indices calculated from `queries`.
    #   - The state of `n`, `operations`, `queries`, and `array` remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #Given this understanding, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    return result
    #The program returns `result` which contains elements from `array` at positions determined by the indices calculated from `queries`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It modifies an initially empty array based on the operations and returns a list of elements from the array at positions specified by the queries. Each operation either appends a value to the array or duplicates the array. The queries are indices into the final array, and the function handles indices larger than the array length by using modulo arithmetic.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b and x describing the type and value of each operation, and queries is a list of positive integers representing the queries.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: The variables `n`, `operations`, `queries`, and `t` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, but the actual output will be a series of results printed to the console for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of operations and queries. For each test case, it processes the operations and outputs the results corresponding to the queries.
