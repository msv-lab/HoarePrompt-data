In the given task, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The loop head only contains the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. The state of `t` is already provided as an integer within the specified range, so no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. However, we need to ensure that the loop head is correctly set up for the loop to start executing.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**

Explanation:
- The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is already defined as an integer in the given range.
- The loop variable `_` does not need an initial value since it is reassigned in each iteration by the `range` function.
- No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted as there are none other than `_`.

This state ensures that the loop will execute as expected for the given number of test cases.
