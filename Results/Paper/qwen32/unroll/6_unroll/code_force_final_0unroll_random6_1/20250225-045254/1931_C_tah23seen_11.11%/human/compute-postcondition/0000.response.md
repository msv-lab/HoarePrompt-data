Output State: **arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 \le a_i \le n, and n is the length of the list arr; i is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `i` has been set to 0. The initial state of the list `arr` and the condition that each integer `a_i` in `arr` satisfies `1 \le a_i \le n` with `n` being the length of the list `arr` remains unchanged.
