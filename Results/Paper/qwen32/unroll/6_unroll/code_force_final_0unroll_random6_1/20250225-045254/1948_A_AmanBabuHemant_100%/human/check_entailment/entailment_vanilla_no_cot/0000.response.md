Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly handles the case where `n` is odd, but it also incorrectly handles the case where `n` is even. The program assumes that a string with `n` special characters can only be constructed if `n` is even, which is incorrect. In fact, a string with an odd number of special characters can also be constructed.

Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

For `n = 1`, the program outputs `NO`, but a valid string could be `AB`, which has exactly one special character.

For `n = 2`, the program correctly outputs a valid string like `AAB`.

For `n = 3`, the program outputs `NO`, but a valid string could be `AABA`, which has exactly three special characters.

The program should be able to generate a valid string for any `n` from 1 to 50. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AB')
        else:
            # Create a pattern like AABAAB... with exactly n special characters
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if n % 2 == 1:
                s += 'A'
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the program handles the case where `n` is odd by appending an extra 'A' to the string, ensuring that there are exactly `n` special characters.
