Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that the number of special characters `n` must be even, and it fails to generate a valid string when `n` is odd. However, the problem description does not restrict `n` to be even. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 1`. The string "AAB" has 2 special characters, but we need exactly 1 special character. A valid string for `n = 1` could be "AB", which has exactly 1 special character at position 1. 

Another example is when `n = 3`. A valid string could be "AAABB", which has exactly 3 special characters at positions 1, 3, and 4.

The program should be able to generate valid strings for both even and odd values of `n`. Here's a corrected version of the program that handles both cases:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AB')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if n % 2 == 1:
                s += 'A'
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version handles the case when `n` is odd by appending an additional 'A' to the string, ensuring that the number of special characters is exactly `n`.
