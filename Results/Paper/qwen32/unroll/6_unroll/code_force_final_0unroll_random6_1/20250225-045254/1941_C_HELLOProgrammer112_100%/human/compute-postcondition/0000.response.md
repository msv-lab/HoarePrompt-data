In the provided for loop, the only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop will iterate based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is `t` according to the problem description. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

The loop will execute `t` times, and since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already in a valid state to ensure the loop executes. No adjustment is needed for `t` itself, but we need to ensure that the input function will provide this value.

Since we are only concerned with the state before the loop starts, and the loop head does not involve any other variables directly, the state does not need to include `n` or `s` because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, adjusted if necessary, remains:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
