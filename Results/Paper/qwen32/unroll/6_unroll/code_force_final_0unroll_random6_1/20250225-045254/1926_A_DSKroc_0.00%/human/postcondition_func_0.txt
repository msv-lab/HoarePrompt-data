The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a distinct string of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints 'A' if there are more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'.
