Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, and the next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the elements of the array. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one based on the given constraints.**
