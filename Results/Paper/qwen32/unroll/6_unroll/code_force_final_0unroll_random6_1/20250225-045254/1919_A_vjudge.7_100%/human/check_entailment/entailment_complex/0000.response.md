### Reasoning:

The program determines the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins Alice and Bob have. The key insight is whether the sum of the coins is even or odd:

1. **If the sum of coins (a + b) is even:**
   - Bob wins.
2. **If the sum of coins (a + b) is odd:**
   - Alice wins.

This is because:
- If the sum is even, the players can always force the game into a state where the opponent is left with an even sum on their turn, eventually leading to Bob's win.
- If the sum is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the game into a state where the opponent is left with an even sum on their turn, eventually leading to Alice's win.

The logic in the program checks if the sum of the coins is even using the bitwise AND operation with 1 (`a + b & 1 == 0`). This operation checks if the least significant bit of the sum is 0 (even) or 1 (odd).

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, this logic correctly determines the winner based on the described strategy.
