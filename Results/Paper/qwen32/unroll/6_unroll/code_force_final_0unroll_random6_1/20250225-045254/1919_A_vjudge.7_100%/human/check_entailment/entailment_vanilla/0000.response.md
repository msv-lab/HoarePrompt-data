### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the possible outcomes based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have.

1. **Game Mechanics Recap**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
   - The player must then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

2. **Observation**:
   - The game essentially revolves around the total number of coins (a + b).
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Why?**:
   - If `a + b` is even, no matter what Alice does, Bob can always mirror her moves to ensure that he is the one to make the last move (i.e., the move that leaves both wallets empty).
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can always make the first move, and then mirror Bob's moves to ensure she is the one to make the last move.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd (`a + b & 1 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the observation that the game's outcome is determined by the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.
   - The bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`) is a valid and efficient way to check the parity of the sum.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct as it accurately determines the winner based on the total number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
