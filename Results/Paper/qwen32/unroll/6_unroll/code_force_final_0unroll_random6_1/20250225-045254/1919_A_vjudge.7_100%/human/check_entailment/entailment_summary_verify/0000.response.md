### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game.
- Each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- Then, the player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when their wallet has 0 coins) loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- Determine who will win given the initial number of coins in each player's wallet.

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Key Points:
- The program checks if the sum of coins in both wallets (`a + b`) is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it outputs "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it outputs "Alice".

#### Strategy:
The strategy here is based on the observation that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check:
- If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

#### Correctness Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's analyze the logic:
- If the total number of coins is even, the players will alternate turns until all coins are gone. Since Alice goes first, Bob will make the last move, thus winning.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will be able to make the last move, thus winning.

#### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. `1 1` -> Total = 2 (even) -> Bob wins.
2. `1 4` -> Total = 5 (odd) -> Alice wins.
3. `5 3` -> Total = 8 (even) -> Bob wins.
4. `4 5` -> Total = 9 (odd) -> Alice wins.
5. `11 9` -> Total = 20 (even) -> Bob wins.
6. `83 91` -> Total = 174 (even) -> Bob wins.
7. `1032 9307` -> Total = 10339 (odd) -> Alice wins.
8. `839204 7281` -> Total = 846485 (odd) -> Alice wins.
9. `1000000000 1000000000` -> Total = 2000000000 (even) -> Bob wins.
10. `53110 2024` -> Total = 55134 (even) -> Bob wins.

All the provided examples match the expected outcomes based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Additional Analysis:
To further solidify the correctness, let's consider the game mechanics:
- **Even Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is even, after each player's turn, the parity of the total number of coins remains even. Since Alice starts, Bob will always make the last move when the total number of coins reaches zero.
- **Odd Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is odd, after each player's turn, the parity of the total number of coins remains odd. Since Alice starts, she will always make the last move when the total number of coins reaches zero.

This reasoning aligns with the provided function summary and the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct for all the provided test cases and the logic seems sound based on the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

**Final: True**
