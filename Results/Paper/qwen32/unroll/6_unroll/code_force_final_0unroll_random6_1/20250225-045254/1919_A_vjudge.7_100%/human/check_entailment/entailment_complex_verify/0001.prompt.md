You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `test` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `test` ≤ 1000), `a` and `b` retain the values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. For each test case, it determines and prints the winner based on whether the sum of the coins is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the possible outcomes based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have.

1. **Game Mechanics Recap**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
   - The player must then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

2. **Observation**:
   - The game essentially revolves around the total number of coins (a + b).
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Why?**:
   - If `a + b` is even, no matter what Alice does, Bob can always mirror her moves to ensure that he is the one to make the last move (i.e., the move that leaves both wallets empty).
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can always make the first move, and then mirror Bob's moves to ensure she is the one to make the last move.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd (`a + b & 1 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the observation that the game's outcome is determined by the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.
   - The bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`) is a valid and efficient way to check the parity of the sum.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct as it accurately determines the winner based on the total number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
