Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine the correctness.

**Problem Analysis:**
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns. Each turn consists of two steps:
1. A player can choose to swap their wallet with the opponent's wallet or keep their current wallet.
2. A player must then remove one coin from their current wallet.

The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, i.e., when both wallets are empty. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins.

**Reasoning:**
- If the total number of coins is even, the last move will be made by Bob, and Alice will be unable to make a move after that, hence Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins is odd, the last move will be made by Alice, and Bob will be unable to make a move after that, hence Alice wins.

**Program Analysis:**
The provided program reads the number of test cases and the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets for each test case. It then checks the parity of the sum of coins (a + b) and prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

**Code Review:**
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:  # This line checks if the sum is even
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

The bitwise AND operation (`& 1`) is used to check the least significant bit of the sum (a + b). If the least significant bit is 0, the number is even; if it's 1, the number is odd. This is an efficient way to determine the parity.

**Conclusion:**
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
