The code assigns the value of `start_pos` to `current_pos`. No other variables are affected. The initial state specifies that `start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, where n is the length of the permutation p and the array a, and `score` is 0. After the code execution, `current_pos` will hold the value of `start_pos`.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, where n is the length of the permutation p and the array a; `score` is 0; `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`.**
