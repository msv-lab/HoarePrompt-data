### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the difference between consecutive elements will be maximized when the elements are in increasing order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
    - The program reads the number of test cases, `num`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, `num2`, and the elements of the array, `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
    - This function checks if the array `a` is strictly increasing.
    - It iterates through the array and counts the number of non-increasing consecutive pairs.
    - If there are no non-increasing pairs, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic:**
    - If the array is already strictly increasing (as determined by `func_1`), the program prints `0` because no rearrangement is needed to maximize the beauty.
    - Otherwise, it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Issues in the Program:

- The condition `if func_1(a, num2)` is incorrect for determining the maximum beauty. The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is strictly increasing, but this does not necessarily mean that the beauty is `0`. The beauty could still be non-zero even if the array is not strictly increasing, as rearranging the array can potentially increase the beauty.
- The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty regardless of whether the array is initially strictly increasing or not.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that the beauty is `0` if the array is strictly increasing. It should always sort the array and calculate the beauty to ensure the maximum beauty is obtained.

### Correctness: **False**
