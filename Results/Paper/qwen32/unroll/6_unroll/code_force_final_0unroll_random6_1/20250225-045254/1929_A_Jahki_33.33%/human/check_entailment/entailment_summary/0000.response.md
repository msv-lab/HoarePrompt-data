Reasoning:  
The program is intended to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized. 

The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the array is already sorted in ascending order, but it is not used correctly. If the array is already sorted, the program should print the beauty directly, but the program incorrectly prints `0` when the array is sorted.

The program should not check if the array is sorted before calculating the beauty. Instead, it should always sort the array and calculate the beauty. The function `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed. 

Since the program does not handle the case where the array is already sorted correctly, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
