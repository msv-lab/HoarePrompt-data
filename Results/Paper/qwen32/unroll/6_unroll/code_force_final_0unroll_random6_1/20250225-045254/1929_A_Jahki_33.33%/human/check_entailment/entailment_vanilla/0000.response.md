Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided example inputs.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to rearrange the array elements to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. Mathematically, it is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then the array elements.
   
2. **Checking if Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints `0` as the beauty since no rearrangement is needed and the beauty will be `0`.
   
3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array in non-decreasing order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - Finally, it prints the calculated beauty.

### Issues in the Program
- **Logic in `func_1`:** The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the problem requires maximizing the beauty, which is best achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order. Therefore, checking and returning `0` if the array is already sorted is incorrect. The program should always sort the array to maximize the beauty.
- **Function Usage:** The function `func_1` is used incorrectly. It should not be used to determine whether to print `0` or calculate the beauty. Instead, the array should always be sorted to maximize the beauty.

### Corrected Approach
- Always sort the array in non-decreasing order.
- Calculate the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it incorrectly uses the function `func_1` to determine whether to print `0` or calculate the beauty. It should always sort the array and calculate the beauty.

Correctness: **False**
