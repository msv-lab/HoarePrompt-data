The code snippet provided initializes a variable `order` to 0. The list `a` and the variable `num2` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `a` and `num2`, while `order` is now 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is not used in the function; `order` is 0.**
