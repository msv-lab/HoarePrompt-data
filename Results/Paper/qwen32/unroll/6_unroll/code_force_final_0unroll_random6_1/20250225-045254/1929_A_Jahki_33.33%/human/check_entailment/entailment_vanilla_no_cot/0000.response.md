Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the way it determines if the array is already in non-decreasing order and how it calculates the beauty of the array. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, but if it returns `True`, the program incorrectly prints `0` for the beauty, which is not always correct. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array regardless of the initial order of the array.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

In this corrected version, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty directly without checking if the array is already sorted. This ensures that the beauty is always calculated as the maximum possible value.
