#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a. num2 is not used in the function as per the problem description and function definition, so it can be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is not used in the function; `order` is the count of non-increasing consecutive pairs in the list `a`.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if the list `a` is strictly increasing. It returns `True` if every element in the list is less than the next element, otherwise, it returns `False`. The parameter `num2` is not utilized in the function.
