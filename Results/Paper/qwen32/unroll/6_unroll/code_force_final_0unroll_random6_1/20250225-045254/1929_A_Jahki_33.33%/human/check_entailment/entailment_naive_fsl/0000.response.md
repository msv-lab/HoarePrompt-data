Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array in all cases. The issue lies in the handling of the `func_1` function, which checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If the array is sorted, the program incorrectly prints `0` regardless of the actual beauty of the array.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
For the input `1 3 2`, the sorted array is `1 2 3`. The beauty of this array is calculated as `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`. However, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using `func_1`, which incorrectly returns `False` for the input `1 3 2` because `3 > 2`. Instead of sorting the array and calculating the beauty, the program incorrectly prints `0`.

### Correct Approach:
The program should always sort the array in non-decreasing order and then calculate the beauty. The `func_1` function is unnecessary and should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version will always sort the array and compute the beauty correctly for all possible inputs.
