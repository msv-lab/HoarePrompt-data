### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program related to the unnecessary use of the `func_1` function, which incorrectly determines whether the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. The program then incorrectly prints `0` if `func_1` returns `True`, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and the reasoning behind the original assessment:

1. **Issue with `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to check if the array is strictly increasing, but it is not necessary for solving the problem.
   - The function incorrectly returns `True` only if the array is strictly increasing, not if it is non-decreasing or already sorted.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Sorted Arrays:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if `func_1` returns `True`, the beauty of the array is `0`.
   - This is incorrect because the beauty of a sorted array (either strictly increasing or non-decreasing) should still be calculated.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to always sort the array in non-decreasing order and then compute the beauty of the array.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

### Counterexample:
The original assessment provides a valid counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- **Input:** `1 3 2`
- **Expected Output:** `2`
- **Actual Output:** `0`

This counterexample shows that the program incorrectly prints `0` even though the maximum beauty of the array `[1, 3, 2]` is `2` when sorted to `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and flawed use of the `func_1` function and the incorrect handling of sorted arrays.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
