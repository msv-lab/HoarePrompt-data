### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem by distributing the bets in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - It calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k`.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - It initializes a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is `m / k[i]`. This means that if the `i`-th outcome wins, the total bet (`sum(c)`) multiplied by `k[i]` will be exactly `m`.

4. **Simplifying Bets:**
   - It calculates the GCD of the elements in `c` and divides each element by this GCD to simplify the bets while maintaining the ratio.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It checks if the sum of the simplified bets `sum(c)` is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints the bets. If not, it prints `-1`.

However, the logic in the last step is incorrect. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` should actually be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. But the main issue is that the logic for generating `c` is flawed. The condition should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` corrected to `if sum(c) >= m / gcd(*k):` to ensure the sum of bets is strictly less than the minimum amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Correctness:
The current implementation incorrectly checks the feasibility condition and does not correctly ensure that the sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
