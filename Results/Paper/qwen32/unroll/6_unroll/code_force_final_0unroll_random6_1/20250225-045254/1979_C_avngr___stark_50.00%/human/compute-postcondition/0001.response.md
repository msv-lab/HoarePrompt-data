The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is derived from the `numbers` list starting from the second element (`numbers[1:]`). For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements (the first element is `t`, the number of test cases, and the second element should be the first `num` value).

To ensure the loop executes, `numbers` should have at least `t + 1` elements, where the first element is `t` and the subsequent `t` elements represent the `n` values for each test case.

Since the loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, `num` will take the values starting from the second element of `numbers`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `numbers` has at least one test case's data following the initial `t`.

State: **`numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, and `numbers` has at least `t + 1` elements, with the subsequent elements representing the `n` values and the respective lists of multipliers for each test case, `hcf` is assigned the value `t`**.

To make it more concrete:
- `numbers[0]` is `t` (number of test cases).
- `numbers[1]` is the integer `n` for the first test case.
- The loop will start with `num` being `numbers[1]`, which should be a valid `n` value for the first test case.

State: **`numbers` is a list where `numbers[0]` is `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `numbers[1]` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) for the first test case, and `hcf` is assigned the value `t`**.
