To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to carefully analyze the provided code and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` is the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines. Each pair consists of an integer `n` (number of outcomes) and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (multipliers for each outcome).
- `hcf` is initially set to the value of `t`.

The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it will iterate over all elements of `numbers` except the first one. However, the loop body only uses `num` in the `gcd` function with `hcf`. Since the loop does not process the pairs of `n` and `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`, but rather all elements of `numbers` after the first one, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Typically, the loop should process the `k_i` values for each test case, but the given code doesn't do that.

Given the code:
```python
for num in numbers[1:]:
    hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
```
The loop will update `hcf` to be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `hcf` and each subsequent element in `numbers` starting from the second element.

Since the problem statement does not specify how to handle the pairs of `n` and `k_i`, and the loop only processes elements of `numbers`, we will assume that `numbers` contains only the test case count `t` followed by the multipliers `k_i` directly (which is not the typical structure given the problem description, but we have to work with what is provided).

Let's assume `numbers` is structured such that after the first element `t`, the rest are the `k_i` values directly. The loop will then compute the GCD of `t` and all subsequent `k_i` values.

**Output State:**
- `hcf` will be the GCD of the initial value `t` and all the subsequent elements in `numbers`.

Thus, the output state in the required format is:

Output State: **hcf is the GCD of the initial value `t` and all the subsequent elements in `numbers`.**
