### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserting them back into the list in the same position. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list `n` and the list of integers `list1`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the list starting from the second element (index 1).
   - If an element is greater than the previous element and is at least 10, it splits that element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
   - This operation is performed iteratively for each element in the list.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing the list, the program checks if it is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function sorts the list and compares it to the original list. If they are the same, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, the program prints "Yes" if the list can be sorted, otherwise it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incomplete Transformation:** The program only performs one pass through the list and splits elements when they are greater than the previous element and at least 10. This is not sufficient to guarantee that the list can be sorted. For example, in the case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, but it will not handle the subsequent elements correctly to achieve a sorted order.
- **Inefficient Handling of Multiple Splits:** The program does not handle the case where multiple splits are needed to achieve a sorted order. It only performs a single pass and does not recheck the list after making changes.
- **Logic Flaw:** The logic of splitting elements based on the comparison with the previous element is flawed. It does not account for the possibility that a split might affect the ordering of elements that come later in the list.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly determine if the list can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
