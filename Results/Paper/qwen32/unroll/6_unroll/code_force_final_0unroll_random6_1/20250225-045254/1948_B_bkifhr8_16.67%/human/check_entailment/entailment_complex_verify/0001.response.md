### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several flaws in the provided program. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Operation Attempt**:
   - The program only attempts to split a number if the current number is greater than the next number and is greater than or equal to 10. This is a very limited condition and does not handle all cases where splitting could lead to a sorted array.
   - The operation is only attempted once per pair of elements, which is insufficient. Multiple splits might be necessary to achieve a sorted array.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The program checks if the list is sorted after attempting the operation. However, due to the limited and insufficient operation logic, the list may not be sorted even if it could be sorted with a different sequence of operations.

3. **Example Case**:
   - The example case `[12, 28, 5]` is a good illustration. The program splits `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is not sorted. The program then checks if the list is sorted and incorrectly concludes that it is not possible to sort the array.

### Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting numbers. The program's approach is too limited and does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after performing the operations.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**
