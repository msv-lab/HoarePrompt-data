Let's carefully analyze the given problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if it is possible to sort a given array by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The key points are:
- Elements can be split any number of times.
- The goal is to achieve a non-decreasing order of the array.

### Provided Code Analysis

The code provided attempts to address the problem by iterating through the list and performing the split operation when necessary. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the list and the list itself.
2. **Operation Attempt**: The code iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and greater than or equal to 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the number into its digits and inserts them back into the list at the same position.
3. **Checking Sorted Order**: After attempting to perform the operation, the code checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. If the list is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues with the Provided Code

The provided code has several issues:
1. **Single Pass Limitation**: The code only makes one pass through the list to attempt the split operation. This is insufficient because multiple splits might be needed, and the list might require multiple passes to become sorted.
2. **Inadequate Handling of Complex Cases**: The code only splits numbers when the current number is greater than the next number and greater than or equal to 10. However, the problem requires handling more complex scenarios where multiple splits and rearrangements might be necessary.
3. **Inefficient Approach**: The code does not guarantee that the list will be sorted after performing the operations, and it does not handle all possible cases where the list can be sorted by splitting numbers.

### Correctness Evaluation

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting numbers. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these limitations.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
