Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Here are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. The program only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10. It then splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list. However, it does not continue to check if the resulting list is sorted or if further splits are needed.

2. The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted, but the program does not guarantee that the list is in a state where `func_1` can return `True` after the loop. The loop might not handle all necessary splits to achieve a sorted list.

3. The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed to achieve a sorted list. For example, if the list is `[12, 30, 4]`, the program will split `30` into `3` and `0`, but the resulting list `[12, 3, 0, 4]` is not sorted and further splits might be needed.

A correct approach would involve repeatedly checking and splitting elements until no more splits are needed or until the list is sorted. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(lst):
    while True:
        changed = False
        for p in range(1, len(lst)):
            if lst[p - 1] > lst[p]:
                a = lst[p - 1]
                if a >= 10:
                    lst.pop(p - 1)
                    digits = [int(d) for d in str(a)]
                    lst[p - 1:p - 1] = digits
                    changed = True
                    break
                else:
                    return False
        if not changed:
            break
    return lst == sorted(lst)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version of the program will repeatedly attempt to split elements and check if the list is sorted until no more splits are needed or the list is sorted.
