Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the values read from the input, and `s` still holds its original value as a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
