You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a result based on specific conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints half of `A` multiplied by `C`; otherwise, it prints `A` divided by 2 (integer division), followed by the result of `X * C + B` where `X` is `A` divided by 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible cases. Let's analyze the code and find a potential issue.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X)
    print(X * C + B)
```
In this part, the code prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating and printing the actual cost. This print statement should be removed. Additionally, the logic for calculating the cost when `A` is odd is incorrect. The correct logic should be to buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            pairs = A // 2
            remainder = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remainder * B)

```
The corrected code ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price if necessary.

Let's test the original code with the provided example:
For the input:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```

The original code would produce:
```
1
9
1
2
15
2
20
```

The correct output should be:
```
9
14
15
20
```

As we can see, the original code does not produce the correct output for the third and fourth test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
