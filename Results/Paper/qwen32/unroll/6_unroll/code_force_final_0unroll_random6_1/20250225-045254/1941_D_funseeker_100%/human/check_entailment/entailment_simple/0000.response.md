### Reasoning:
The program reads multiple test cases, each describing a game where a ball is passed among players in a circle under certain rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and verifies its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a single line from standard input and returns it as a stripped string.
   - `func_2()`: Calls `func_1()` and converts the returned string to an integer, which represents the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()`: Calls `func_1()`, splits the returned string by spaces, and converts each part to an integer, returning a list of these integers.
   - `func_4()`: This is the main function that handles each test case. It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates through each throw:
     - Reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
     - Updates the set `ans` to include the players who could have the ball after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if the direction is unknown (`'?'`).
     - If the direction is `'0'` (clockwise) or `'?'`, it adds `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If the direction is `'1'` (counterclockwise) or `'?'`, it adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - After processing each throw, the set `ans` is updated to the new set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - After all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` because player positions are 1-indexed.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the number of players who could have the ball after all throws.
   - Prints the sorted list of these player numbers.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles all possible directions (`'0'`, `'1'`, `'?'`) and updates the set of possible players accordingly.
- It correctly uses modulo operations to wrap around the circle of players.
- It handles the edge case where the position might be `0` and adjusts it to `n`.
- The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
