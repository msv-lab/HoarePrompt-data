### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` converts the string returned by `func_1()` into an integer, which is used to determine the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()` reads a line from standard input, splits it into parts, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This function is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4()` processes each test case. It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c` (either '0', '1', or '?').
   - Depending on the direction `c`, it calculates the new positions of the ball:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - After processing all throws for the current test case, it updates `ans` to `temp` and ensures that `0` in the set is replaced with `n` (since player numbering is from 1 to n).

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws for a test case, `func_4()` prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and their sorted list.

4. **Circular Adjustment:**
   - The use of modulo operation (`% n`) ensures that the player positions wrap around correctly in the circle.
   - The adjustment for `0` to `n` ensures that player numbers are correctly represented.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes each test case by maintaining a set of possible player positions after each throw and correctly handles the circular nature of the player arrangement. It reads inputs correctly, processes each throw according to the given rules, and outputs the correct results.

**Correctness: True**
