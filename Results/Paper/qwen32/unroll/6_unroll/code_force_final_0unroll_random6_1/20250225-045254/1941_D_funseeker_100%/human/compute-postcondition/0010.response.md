Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of players, an integer between 2 and 1000), `m` (the number of throws, an integer between 1 and 1000), and `x` (the initial player with the ball, an integer between 1 and n). The function returns the player number who ends up with the ball after `m` throws, assuming the ball is passed to the next player in a circular fashion starting from player `x`.**
