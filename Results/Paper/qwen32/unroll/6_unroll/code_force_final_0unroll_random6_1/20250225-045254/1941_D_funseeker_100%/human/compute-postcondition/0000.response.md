Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. The precondition that `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` is an integer representing the initial player with the ball (1 <= x <= n) is still valid, but the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are now determined by the return values of `func_3()`.**

In simple terms: The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to whatever `func_3()` returns, but they still represent the number of players, number of throws, and the initial player with the ball, respectively, within their specified ranges.
