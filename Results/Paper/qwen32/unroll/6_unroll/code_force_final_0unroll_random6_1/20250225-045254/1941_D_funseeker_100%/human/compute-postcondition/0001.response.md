Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player with the ball (1 <= x <= n); `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.**

Natural language description: The variable `ans` has been initialized as a set containing the value of `x`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain as specified by the precondition, representing the number of players, the number of throws, and the initial player with the ball, respectively.
