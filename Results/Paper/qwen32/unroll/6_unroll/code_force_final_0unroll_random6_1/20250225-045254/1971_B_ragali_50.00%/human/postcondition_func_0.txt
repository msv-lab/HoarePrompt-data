The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It prints 'YES' if the string contains more than one unique character; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it also prints a modified version of the string based on specific conditions.
