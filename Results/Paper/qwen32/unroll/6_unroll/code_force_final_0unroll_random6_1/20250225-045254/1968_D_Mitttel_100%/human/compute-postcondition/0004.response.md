To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute its first iteration, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`.

1. **Condition `not vis[s]`:**
   - This condition checks if the position `s` (which is a tuple `(P_B, P_S)` representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha) has not been visited.
   - `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, indicating that initially, none of the positions have been visited.
   - Since `vis` is initialized with all zeros and `s` is a valid position (a tuple of two integers within the bounds of the problem), `vis[s]` will be `0` (False) initially.
   - Therefore, `not vis[s]` will be `True` as long as `s` is a valid index within the bounds of `vis`.

2. **Condition `k > 0`:**
   - This condition checks if the number of turns `k` is greater than 0.
   - Since `k` is a non-negative integer, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these observations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it is greater than 0. The initial state of `vis` and `s` already satisfies the condition `not vis[s]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element in `p` is a distinct integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive); `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha; `k` must be greater than 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
