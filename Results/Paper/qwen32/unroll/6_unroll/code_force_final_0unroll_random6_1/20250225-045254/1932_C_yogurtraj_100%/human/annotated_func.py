#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: For each test case, the output is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the result of the computation based on the input values `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as described in the code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` with characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list of `n` integers based on the given rules and prints this list.
