You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to process a series of commands ('L' and 'R') on an array and output the remainder of the product of the array elements modulo `m` after each command is processed. The commands either remove the leftmost ('L') or rightmost ('R') element of the array.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by precomputing some values and then iterating backwards through the commands. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing**:
   - The program initializes `l` to the count of 'L' commands.
   - It then sets `k` to the element at index `l - 1` if the last command is 'L', or `l` if the last command is 'R'. This is incorrect because `l` is not an index but a count.
   - `q1` and `q2` are initialized based on whether the last command is 'L' or 'R', but these indices are not correctly used to traverse the array.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The program iterates backwards through the commands and updates `k` based on the current command.
   - However, the indices `q1` and `q2` are not correctly updated to reflect the current state of the array after each command.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results in reverse order, which is incorrect since the problem requires the results to be in the order of command processing.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating through the commands in the given order.
- Maintaining the product of the current array elements modulo `m`.
- Updating the product based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
- Outputting the result after each command.

### Correctness of the Program
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not properly handle the indices and the order of operations.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
