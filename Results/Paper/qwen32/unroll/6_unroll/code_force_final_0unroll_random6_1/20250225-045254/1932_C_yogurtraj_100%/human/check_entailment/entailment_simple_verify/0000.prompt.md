You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly process the commands and compute the required remainders. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initialization and Logic Errors**:
    - The program initializes `k` based on the last command, which is incorrect. It should compute the product of all elements initially and then modify it based on the commands.
    - The indices `q1` and `q2` are incorrectly set and used, leading to incorrect multiplication and modulo operations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Commands**:
    - The program does not correctly handle the sequence of commands ('L' and 'R'). It incorrectly assumes the product based on the last command and then tries to adjust it, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Example of Failure**:
    - Let's consider the first test case from the example:
        ```
        4 6
        3 1 4 2
        LRRL
        ```
    - The correct output should be `0 2 4 1`.
    - However, the provided program will not produce this output because it incorrectly initializes `k` and does not correctly update the product based on the sequence of commands.

### Correct Approach:
- Initialize the product of all elements in the array and take the modulo `m`.
- For each command, output the current product modulo `m`.
- Remove the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command and update the product accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input().strip()
        
        # Calculate the initial product modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        result = []
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        
        for cmd in commands:
            result.append(product)
            if cmd == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[left], m - 2, m)) % m
                left += 1
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[right], m - 2, m)) % m
                right -= 1
        
        print(*result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The initial product of all elements modulo `m` is computed.
- For each command, the current product is output.
- The product is updated by removing the leftmost or rightmost element using modular inverse (Fermat's Little Theorem for prime `m`).

Since the original program fails to handle the sequence of commands correctly, it is incorrect.
