The code appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and the condition `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)` still holds true. The only change is that `ops` now includes the new sublist.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed, with the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it.**
