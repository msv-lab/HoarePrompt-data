Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX (minimum excluded non-negative integer).
- The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- We need to output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- This function is supposed to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` to replace with its MEX to maximize the sum.
- It checks all possible subarrays and computes the new sum if that subarray were replaced by its MEX.
- It keeps track of the maximum sum found and the corresponding subarray indices.
- However, the way it calculates the new sum is incorrect. It does not actually compute the MEX of the subarray but instead calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- This function seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations to set all elements in a subarray to a specific value, but its implementation is unclear and seems to be incorrectly recursive and repetitive.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- This function is supposed to perform the actual replacement of the subarray `[r, l]` with its MEX.
- It appends operations to the `ops` list and modifies the list `lst` in place.
- However, it does not actually compute the MEX of the subarray and instead sets all elements in the subarray to the length of the subarray.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The code does not correctly compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it uses the length of the subarray to replace its elements.
2. **Incorrect Operation Generation**: The operations generated by `func_2` and `func_3` are not correct and do not correspond to the intended MEX replacement.
3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_1` for finding the optimal subarray to replace is flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly compute the MEX of subarrays and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
