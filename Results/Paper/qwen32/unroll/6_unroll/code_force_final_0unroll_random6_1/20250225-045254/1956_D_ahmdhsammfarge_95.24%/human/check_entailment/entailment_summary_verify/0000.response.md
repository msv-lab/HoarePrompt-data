### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to its MEX value. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the optimal range `[l, r]` to perform the MEX operation on. It calculates `sm` as the sum of elements outside the range `[i, j]` plus the square of the length of the range. This is incorrect because the sum should be based on the MEX value of the subarray, not the square of its length. The square of the length is a heuristic and does not account for the actual MEX value, which is crucial for maximizing the sum.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of operations. However, the recursive calls and the operations appended do not seem to logically maximize the sum. The function does not compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are optimal.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the MEX operation on the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and update the operations list. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are optimal. The function also contains redundant operations and does not correctly update the array `lst` to reflect the MEX operation.

#### Verification Against Function Summary:
- **Function Summary for `func_3`**:
  - The function modifies a list `lst` by setting all elements from index `r` to `l` to the value `n` (where `n` is the length of the sublist from `r` to `l` inclusive) and returns the modified list.
  - This summary does not align with the problem's requirement to set the subarray to its MEX value, not the length of the subarray.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. The issues lie in the incorrect calculation of the MEX value and the generation of operations. The code does not ensure that the operations are optimal and do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
