The code snippet appends a new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the `ops` list, regardless of the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`. The values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and the condition regarding the minimum value in the sublist are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed. The new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` has been appended to `ops`.**
