### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` is designed to find the optimal range `[l, r]` to perform the MEX operation on. The current implementation calculates the sum `sm` based on the square of the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1) ** 2` instead of the actual MEX value of the subarray. This is a significant issue because the MEX value is crucial for determining the correct operation to maximize the sum of the array.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` is intended to generate a sequence of operations. However, its logic is recursive and does not directly contribute to maximizing the sum. It appends operations without ensuring that these operations are optimal or even correct.

#### Function `func_3`:
The function `func_3` attempts to apply the MEX operation on the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and update the operations list. However, similar to `func_1`, it does not correctly compute the MEX value. Instead, it replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray `n = l - r + 1`. This is incorrect because the MEX value should be used, not the length of the subarray.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at various points. However, they do not address the core issue of incorrectly computing the MEX value. The annotations show that the program returns `(0, 3)` for the example `4 1 100 2 1`, which is not necessarily incorrect but does not lead to the optimal solution.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

The optimal operations are:
1. Set `a[3]` to `0` (MEX of `[2, 1]` is `0`).
2. Set `a[3]` and `a[4]` to `2` (MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`).

The provided code does not perform these operations correctly because it does not compute the MEX value properly. Instead, it replaces subarrays with their lengths, which is not the intended behavior.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. The primary issue is the incorrect computation of the MEX value, which is essential for determining the optimal operations.

### Final:
Final: **False**
