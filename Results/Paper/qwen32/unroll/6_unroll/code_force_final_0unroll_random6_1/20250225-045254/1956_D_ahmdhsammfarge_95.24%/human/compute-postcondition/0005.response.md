To determine the output state after the execution of `func_2(r, l, ops)`, we need to assume the behavior of `func_2`. Since the implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we can only infer based on the given context and typical operations that such a function might perform. 

Given the context, it's reasonable to assume that `func_2` might modify `lst` based on the indices `r` and `l` and the operations stored in `ops`. However, no specific modifications to `lst` are described, and the only operation described is the appending of `[r + 1, r + 1]` to `ops` prior to calling `func_2`.

Since the problem does not specify any changes to `r`, `l`, `lst`, or the contents of `ops` other than the initial append operation, we can assume that `func_2` does not alter these variables in a way that we can determine from the given information.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial conditions with the new operation appended to `ops`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that includes the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` appended to it.**
