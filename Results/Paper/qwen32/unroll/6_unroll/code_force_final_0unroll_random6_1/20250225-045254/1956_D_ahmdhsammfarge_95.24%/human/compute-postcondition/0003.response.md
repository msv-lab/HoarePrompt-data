Postcondition: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` is appended to `ops`. Otherwise, `ops` remains unchanged.**
