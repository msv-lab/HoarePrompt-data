Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

For example, consider the test case `3 2`:
- The rectangle is `3 x 2`.
- It can be cut into two rectangles of `3 x 1`.
- These two `3 x 1` rectangles can be combined to form a `1 x 6` rectangle, which is different from the original `3 x 2` rectangle.

However, according to the provided program, the output for `3 2` would be "No" because `b` (which is 2) is even, but the logic is incorrect. The program should check if either `a` or `b` can be divided into two parts that can form a new rectangle.

The correct approach would be to check if either `a` or `b` is even, because only then can the rectangle be cut into two parts that can potentially form a new rectangle. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd, or vice versa.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This version checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which is the correct logic based on the problem description.
