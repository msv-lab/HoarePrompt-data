### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the critical insight that Bob can form a new rectangle if at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) is even. However, the provided program only checks if \( b \) is even and does not consider the case where \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd. This means the program is incomplete and does not cover all scenarios where Bob can form a new rectangle.

The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1` only returns 'yes' if \( b \) is even, which aligns with the original assessment that the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
