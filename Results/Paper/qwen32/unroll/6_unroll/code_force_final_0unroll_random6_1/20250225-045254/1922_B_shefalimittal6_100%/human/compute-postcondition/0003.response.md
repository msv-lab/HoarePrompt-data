Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, as it has been assigned the value of `int(data[idx])`; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `idx` is 0.**

In this output state, `t` has been updated to the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, while `data` and `idx` remain unchanged.
