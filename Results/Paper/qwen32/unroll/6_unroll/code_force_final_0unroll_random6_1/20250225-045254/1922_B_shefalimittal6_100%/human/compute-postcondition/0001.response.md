The code `data = input().split()` takes the entire input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that `data` will be a list of strings, where each string is a part of the original input.

Given the initial state, `input` contains all the test cases and their respective values concatenated into a single string. After splitting, `data` will be a list of these values as strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values.**
