The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
