The code snippet provided simply initializes the variable `idx` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `data`) are modified by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the addition of the `idx` variable set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `idx` is 0.**
