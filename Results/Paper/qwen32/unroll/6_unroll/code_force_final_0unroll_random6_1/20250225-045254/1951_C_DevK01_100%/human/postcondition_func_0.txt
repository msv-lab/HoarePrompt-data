The function calculates and prints the minimum cost required to purchase a specified total number of tickets (`k`) over a given number of days (`n`), with a daily limit on the number of tickets that can be bought (`m`). The cost is determined based on the prices of tickets for each day, provided in a list. The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by its own set of `n`, `m`, `k`, and ticket prices.
