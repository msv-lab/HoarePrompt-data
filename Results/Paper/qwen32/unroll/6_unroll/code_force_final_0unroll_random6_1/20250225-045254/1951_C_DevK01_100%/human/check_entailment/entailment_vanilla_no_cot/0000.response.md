Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in how the program calculates the cost of purchasing tickets. The program assumes that it can simply sort the prices and then purchase tickets in a way that minimizes the cost by always buying the cheapest available tickets, which is not the correct approach given the constraints of the problem.

The key constraint that the program does not handle correctly is the price increase for subsequent days after purchasing tickets on a given day. The program does not account for the fact that buying tickets on a day will increase the prices on all subsequent days, and it does not dynamically adjust its strategy based on this price increase.

A correct approach would involve a more dynamic strategy, possibly using a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price, while also keeping track of the price increases. Additionally, the program should handle cases where the number of tickets to buy is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Use a priority queue to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price.
2. Keep track of the number of tickets bought and the current price increase.
3. For each ticket purchase, update the price increase for subsequent days.
4. Continue until the required number of tickets is bought.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct implementation would likely involve more sophisticated logic than the provided program.
