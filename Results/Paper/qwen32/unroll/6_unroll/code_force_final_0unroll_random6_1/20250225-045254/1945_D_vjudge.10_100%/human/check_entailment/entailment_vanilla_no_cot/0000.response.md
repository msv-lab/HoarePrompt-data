Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. However, it does not correctly iterate through the queue and account for the cost of bribing people.
2. The variable `pergunta` is initialized to infinity and is supposed to hold the minimum cost, but the way the cost is updated is incorrect. The cost should consider not only the direct cost to bribe someone but also the cost to bribe those in between.
3. The loop in `func_1` iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, but it does not correctly handle the cost calculation for moving Kirill to a specific position `m`.

To correctly solve the problem, a priority queue (min-heap) or a similar data structure can be used to efficiently find the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions. The cost should be calculated considering both the direct bribe cost and the cost to bribe those in between.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def solve(n, m, a, b):
    # Priority queue to store (cost, position)
    pq = []
    # Initialize the cost to move to position n (Kirill's original position)
    heapq.heappush(pq, (0, n))
    # Array to store the minimum cost to move to each position
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 0
    
    while pq:
        current_cost, current_pos = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if current_pos <= m:
            return current_cost
        for i in range(current_pos - 1, -1, -1):
            # Cost to move from current_pos to i
            move_cost = current_cost + a[i] + (current_pos - i - 1) * b[i]
            if move_cost < dp[i]:
                dp[i] = move_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (move_cost, i))
    return float('inf')

numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(solve(n, m, a, b))
```

This corrected program uses a priority queue to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions, considering both the direct bribe cost and the cost to bribe those in between.
