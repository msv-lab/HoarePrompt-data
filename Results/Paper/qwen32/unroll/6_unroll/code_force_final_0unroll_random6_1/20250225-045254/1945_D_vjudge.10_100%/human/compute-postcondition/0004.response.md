Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `pergunta` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `a` (a list of integers where each integer represents a value associated with a person in the queue besides Kirill), `b` (a list of integers where each integer represents another value associated with a person in the queue besides Kirill), `n` (an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill), and `m` (an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill). For each test case, if the conditions related to the values in `a` and `b` and the constraints on `n` and `m` are satisfied, the function returns a result indicating whether Kirill can reach a position within the first `m` positions in the queue after some operations. The specific operations and conditions are not detailed here, but the function handles multiple test cases as specified by `pergunta`.**
