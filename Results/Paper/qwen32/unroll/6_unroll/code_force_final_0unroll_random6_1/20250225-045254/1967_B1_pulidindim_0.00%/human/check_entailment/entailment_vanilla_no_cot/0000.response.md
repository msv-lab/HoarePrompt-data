Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down why:

The problem asks for the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be trying to count based on some incorrect assumptions and calculations.

Here is a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:
- The logic `countmins = count - 1` and `g = n / count` does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs.
- The condition `if g < countmins: break` does not make sense in the context of the problem.
- The line `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly accumulate the number of valid pairs.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. This can be done efficiently by leveraging the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This program correctly iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the required condition. However, this solution might not be efficient enough for the given constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)). A more optimized approach would be necessary to handle the large input sizes efficiently, potentially involving number-theoretic optimizations.
