Let's analyze the loop to understand how the output state is determined:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
   - `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30.
   - `new_arr` is an empty list.
   - `xor` is 0.
   - `thing1` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `i` in `cur_arr`, the following steps occur:
     - `xor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `i` (i.e., `xor ^= i`).
     - The condition `if not xor >> bit & 1` checks if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0. If this condition is true, `xor` is appended to `new_arr`, and `xor` is reset to 0.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `xor` will hold the cumulative XOR of elements from `cur_arr` that did not trigger the condition `if not xor >> bit & 1` to be true.
   - `new_arr` will contain the values of `xor` that were appended to it during the loop, each followed by a reset of `xor` to 0.
   - `thing1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Let's illustrate this with an example to make it clearer. Suppose `cur_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `bit = 0`:

- Iteration 1: `i = 1`
  - `xor = 0 ^ 1 = 1`
  - `xor >> bit & 1` is `1 >> 0 & 1` which is `1 & 1` which is `1` (condition false), so nothing is appended to `new_arr` and `xor` remains `1`.
  
- Iteration 2: `i = 2`
  - `xor = 1 ^ 2 = 3`
  - `xor >> bit & 1` is `3 >> 0 & 1` which is `3 & 1` which is `1` (condition false), so nothing is appended to `new_arr` and `xor` remains `3`.
  
- Iteration 3: `i = 3`
  - `xor = 3 ^ 3 = 0`
  - `xor >> bit & 1` is `0 >> 0 & 1` which is `0 & 1` which is `0` (condition true), so `xor` (which is `0`) is appended to `new_arr` and `xor` is reset to `0`.
  
- Iteration 4: `i = 4`
  - `xor = 0 ^ 4 = 4`
  - `xor >> bit & 1` is `4 >> 0 & 1` which is `4 & 1` which is `0` (condition true), so `xor` (which is `4`) is appended to `new_arr` and `xor` is reset to `0`.

After the loop, `new_arr` is `[0, 4]` and `xor` is `0`.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.**
