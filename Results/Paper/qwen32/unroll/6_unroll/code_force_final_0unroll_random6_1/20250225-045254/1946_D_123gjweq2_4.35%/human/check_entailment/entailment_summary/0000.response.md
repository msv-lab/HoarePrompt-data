Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Incorrect Use of Parameters**: The function `func_1` is supposed to take an array `arr` and a number `x` and return the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to `x`. However, `func_1` currently only calls `find_max` with `arr` and a constant `31`. The value `x` is not passed to `find_max`, and `31` is not a valid bit position for 30-bit integers.

2. **Incorrect Functionality of `find_max`**: The function `find_max` is supposed to determine the maximum number of segments based on the bitwise operations described in the problem. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the bitwise OR and XOR operations as per the problem requirements. It also does not use the value `x` to determine if the bitwise OR of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Logic Errors**: The logic in `find_max` is flawed. It attempts to recursively split the array based on a specific bit, but it does not correctly account for the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments. The decision to include a segment in `new_arr` is based on whether the XOR result of the segment has the current bit set, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The provided code does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `x` is `0` or when the array contains elements that cannot be split into valid segments.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the problem's requirements and is therefore incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
