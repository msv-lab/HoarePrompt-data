To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))`.

Given:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30.
- `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop.
- `xor` is 0, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1.
- `thing1` is -1.
- The `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1.

We need to understand the following:
1. The value returned by `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`.
2. The length of `new_arr`.

Since the specific implementation of `find_max` is not provided, we can only assume it returns some integer value based on `cur_arr` and `bit - 1`. Let's denote this value as `find_max_result`.

The length of `new_arr` is the number of elements in `new_arr`, which is a non-negative integer. Let's denote this value as `new_arr_length`.

The return statement then evaluates to `max(find_max_result, new_arr_length)`, which means the returned value will be the greater of these two values.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `find_max_result` and `new_arr_length`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.**
