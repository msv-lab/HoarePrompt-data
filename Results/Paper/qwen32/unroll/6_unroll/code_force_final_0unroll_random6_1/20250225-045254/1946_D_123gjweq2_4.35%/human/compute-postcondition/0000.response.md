Postcondition: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, and bit is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. The current value of bit is -1, which is not possible given the initial precondition, indicating a logical inconsistency.**

However, if we strictly adhere to the given if condition and ignore the logical inconsistency, the postcondition would be:

Postcondition: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, and the current value of bit is -1.**
