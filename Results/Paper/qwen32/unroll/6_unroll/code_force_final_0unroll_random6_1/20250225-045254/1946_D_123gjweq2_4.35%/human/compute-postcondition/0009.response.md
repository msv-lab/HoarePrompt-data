Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is -1, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `thing1` has been set to -1. All other variables retain their initial values.
