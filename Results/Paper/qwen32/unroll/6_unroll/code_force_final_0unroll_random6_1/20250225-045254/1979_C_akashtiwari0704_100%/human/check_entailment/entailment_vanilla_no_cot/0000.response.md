To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the logic and approach of the solution.

The problem requires us to distribute the bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that the total amount bet, \(S = x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n\), is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome, i.e., \(k_i \cdot x_i > S\) for all \(i\).

The provided program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\), and then assigns each \(x_i\) as the LCM divided by \(k_i\). The sum of these \(x_i\) values is then checked against the LCM. If the sum of the \(x_i\) values is not less than the LCM, the program outputs \(-1\). Otherwise, it prints the \(x_i\) values.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **LCM Calculation:**
   The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\). This is a valid step because the LCM provides a common multiple that can be used to ensure that each \(x_i = \text{LCM} / k_i\) is an integer.

2. **Assigning Bets:**
   The program assigns each bet \(x_i\) as \(\text{LCM} / k_i\). This ensures that for each \(i\), \(k_i \cdot x_i = \text{LCM}\).

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   The program checks if the sum of the \(x_i\) values is less than the LCM. If the sum is not less than the LCM, it outputs \(-1\). Otherwise, it prints the \(x_i\) values.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The condition \(k_i \cdot x_i > S\) must hold for all \(i\). The program only ensures that \(k_i \cdot x_i = \text{LCM}\) for all \(i\). It does not guarantee that \(k_i \cdot x_i > S\) for all \(i\). Specifically, the condition \(S < \text{LCM}\) does not necessarily imply that \(k_i \cdot x_i > S\) for all \(i\).

To ensure the condition \(k_i \cdot x_i > S\) for all \(i\), the program should find a set of \(x_i\) values such that \(S < k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\). The provided solution does not guarantee this condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
