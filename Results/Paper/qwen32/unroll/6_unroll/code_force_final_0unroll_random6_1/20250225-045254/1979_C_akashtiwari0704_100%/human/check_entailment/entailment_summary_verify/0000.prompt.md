You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = lcm(a)
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers and their relationships. It then outputs either a list of derived values or -1, depending on a specific condition involving the sum of these derived values relative to the LCM.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributing the bets based on the LCM divided by each multiplier. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Let's break down the logic:

1. The code calculates the LCM of the multipliers.
2. It then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the bets.
3. It checks if the sum of these bets is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints these bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

The issue arises because the sum of bets being less than the LCM does not necessarily mean that the sum of bets is less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The problem requires that the total sum of bets (`sumo`) is strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the `i-th` outcome.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
The LCM of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`. The bets would be `[1, 1, 1]` (since `2 // 2 = 1` for each multiplier). The sum of bets is `3`, which is not less than `2 * 1 = 2` for any `k_i * x_i`. Therefore, this case should output `-1`, but the code will output `1 1 1`.

Thus, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
