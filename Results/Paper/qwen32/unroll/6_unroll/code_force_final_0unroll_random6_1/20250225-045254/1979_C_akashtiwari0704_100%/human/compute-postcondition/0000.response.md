`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
