Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributing the bets based on the LCM divided by each multiplier. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Let's break down the logic:

1. The code calculates the LCM of the multipliers.
2. It then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the bets.
3. It checks if the sum of these bets is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints these bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

The issue arises because the sum of bets being less than the LCM does not necessarily mean that the sum of bets is less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The problem requires that the total sum of bets (`sumo`) is strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the `i-th` outcome.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
The LCM of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`. The bets would be `[1, 1, 1]` (since `2 // 2 = 1` for each multiplier). The sum of bets is `3`, which is not less than `2 * 1 = 2` for any `k_i * x_i`. Therefore, this case should output `-1`, but the code will output `1 1 1`.

Thus, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
