To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the code and understand its behavior for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Loop Iteration (`for T in range(t)`):**
   - For each iteration, the code performs the following:
     - Defines a function `lcm` to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of a list of integers.
     - Reads an integer `bets` which represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
     - Reads a list `a` of `bets` integers.
     - Computes the LCM of the list `a` and stores it in `prod`.
     - Initializes `sumo` to 0.
     - For each element in `a`, it calculates `prod // a[i]` and stores it back in `a[i]`, then adds this value to `sumo`.
     - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` from the modified list `a` and prints it.

2. **State Changes:**
   - The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified within the loop. They are part of the initial state and remain unchanged.
   - For each test case (each iteration of the loop), the variables `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` are created and modified. However, since we are looking for the state after all iterations, these variables are local to each iteration and do not persist across iterations.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - Since the variables `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` are local to each iteration, their final values are not stored or reflected in the global state after all iterations are complete.
   - The only variables that remain unchanged throughout the loop executions are `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Given this understanding, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20.**
