### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating the LCM:**
   - The program defines a helper function `lcm` to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k`.
   - The LCM is calculated by iteratively applying the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)` to all elements in the list `k`.

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k` and stores it in the variable `prod`.
   - It then calculates the bets by dividing the LCM by each multiplier `k_i` and summing these values.
   - The bets are stored in the list `a`, where `a[i] = prod // k[i]`.

4. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the calculated bets `sumo` is less than the LCM `prod`.
   - If `sumo` is not less than `prod`, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the coins in a way that satisfies the condition.
   - If `sumo` is less than `prod`, it prints the calculated bets.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM calculation is correct, as it uses the standard formula for LCM involving GCD.

- **Correctness of Bet Calculation:**
  - The bets are calculated as `prod // k[i]`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome is the winning one, the total amount received back is `k[i] * (prod // k[i]) = prod`, which is greater than the total amount bet `sumo`.

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `sumo < prod` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

- **Output:**
  - If the condition is met, the program outputs the calculated bets.
  - If the condition is not met, it outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the necessary condition to ensure that the player comes out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
