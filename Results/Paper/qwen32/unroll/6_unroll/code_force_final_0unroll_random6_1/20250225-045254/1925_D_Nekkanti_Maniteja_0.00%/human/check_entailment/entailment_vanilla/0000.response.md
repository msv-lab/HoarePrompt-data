Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions. This expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points
1. **Friendship Value Update**: When a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
2. **Random Selection**: Each pair of children is chosen equiprobably and independently.
3. **Output Requirement**: The result should be in the form of \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program and see if it correctly computes the required expected value.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children \(n\), the number of pairs of friends \(m\), and the number of excursions \(k\).
   - It also reads the friendship details (pairs and their initial friendship values).

2. **Calculation of Constants**:
   - \(M\) is set to \(10^9 + 7\), the modulo value.
   - \(c\) is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs (\(n \times (n-1) / 2\)). However, the program incorrectly calculates this as the inverse of \(n \times (n-1)\) instead of \(n \times (n-1) / 2\).

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value using a loop that iterates \(k\) times, adding values to `s`. The formula used inside the loop seems incorrect and does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Calculation of \(c\)**: The program calculates the modular inverse of \(n \times (n-1)\) instead of \(n \times (n-1) / 2\). This is a critical error.
- **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**: The loop and the formula used to calculate `s` do not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect calculation of \(c\) and the incorrect expected value formula, the program is not correct.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
