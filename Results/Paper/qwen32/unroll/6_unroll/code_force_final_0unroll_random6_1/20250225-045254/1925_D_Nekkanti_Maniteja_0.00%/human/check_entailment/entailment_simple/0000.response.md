### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Requirements:**
1. For each test case, we are given `n` children, `m` pairs of friends with their friendship values, and `k` excursions.
2. We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
3. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` sets the modulo value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` attempts to calculate the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). However, the expression `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is incorrect because it should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.
   - `s = 0` initializes the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a = 0` initializes the sum of initial friendship values.

2. **Reading Friendships:**
   - For each of the `m` friendships, the program reads the pair `(u, v)` and their friendship value `f`, and adds `f` to `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` is supposed to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The logic here seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected sum, but it is not correctly implemented. The expected value calculation should account for the probability of choosing a specific pair and the increasing friendship values over time.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `s % M` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The calculation of `c` is incorrect. It should be the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- The logic inside the loop for calculating `s` is incorrect. The expected sum should be calculated based on the probability of choosing a specific pair and the expected increase in friendship values over time.
- The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship pairs.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correctly implementing the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
