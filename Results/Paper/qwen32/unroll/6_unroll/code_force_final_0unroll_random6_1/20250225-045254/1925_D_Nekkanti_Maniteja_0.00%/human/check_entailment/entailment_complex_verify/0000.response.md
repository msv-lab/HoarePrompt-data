### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment using the annotated code and problem description.

#### Given Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of pairs, i.e., `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - It reads `m` lines of friendships and sums their initial friendship values into `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - It iterates `k` times, updating `s` in each iteration.
   - The formula used inside the loop is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, which is not correct for the problem's requirements.

#### Issues Identified in the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The given program does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over the `k` excursions.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect because it does not consider the contribution of each friendship pair separately and does not properly account for the increasing friendship values.

2. **Ignoring Individual Friendship Values:**
   - The program sums up all the initial friendship values in `a` but does not differentiate between different pairs.
   - It should calculate the expected contribution of each pair separately and then sum them up.

3. **Modular Arithmetic Errors:**
   - The summation should be done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.
   - The program does not handle the modular arithmetic correctly in the summation part.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability of choosing any particular pair is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, which is correctly calculated as `c`.
   - However, the program does not use this probability correctly to calculate the expected value contribution of each pair.

#### Corrected Version:

The corrected version of the logic, as provided in the original assessment, correctly addresses these issues:

- It calculates the probability of choosing any pair, `prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)`.
- It calculates the expected value contribution of each pair separately, considering the increasing friendship values.
- It sums up the contributions of all pairs and handles modular arithmetic correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the required logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
