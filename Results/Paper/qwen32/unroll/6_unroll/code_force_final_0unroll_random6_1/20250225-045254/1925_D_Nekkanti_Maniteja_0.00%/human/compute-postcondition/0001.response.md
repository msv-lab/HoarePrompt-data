To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the provided code and analyze how the variables change with each iteration.

### Code Analysis

1. **Loop Iteration (`for i in range(int(input()))`)**:
   - This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())`: Reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: A constant used for modulo operations.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`: Computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`. However, since `n * (n - 1) // 1` is just `n * (n - 1)`, this simplifies to finding the inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`.
   - `s = 0`: Initializes `s` to 0.
   - `a = 0`: Initializes `a` to 0.

3. **First Inner Loop (`for i in range(m)`)**:
   - This loop runs `m` times, where `m` is the number of edges.
   - `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())`: Reads integers `u`, `v`, and `f` for each edge.
   - `a += f`: Adds the weight `f` of the edge to `a`.

4. **Second Inner Loop (`for i in range(k)`)**:
   - This loop runs `k` times, where `k` is a given integer.
   - `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`: Updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to it.

5. **Output**:
   - `print(s % M)`: Prints the final value of `s` modulo `M`.

### Output State Calculation

After each iteration of the outer loop:
- `s` is computed based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the sum of weights `a`.
- `a` is the sum of all edge weights `f` for the current test case.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`.

The final value of `s` after all iterations of the inner loop is:
\[ s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a) \]
\[ s = c \times m \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c \times i) + c \times a \times k \]
\[ s = c \times m \times c \times \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + c \times a \times k \]
\[ s = \frac{c^2 \times m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2} + c \times a \times k \]

Since `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)`, the final value of `s` is computed modulo `M`.

### Output State

After all test cases are processed, the output state will be the final printed values of `s % M` for each test case. Since the problem asks for the output state in a specific format, we can describe it as follows:

Output State: **The final printed values of `s % M` for each test case.**

This means that for each test case, the value of `s` after processing all edges and iterations is printed modulo `M`.
