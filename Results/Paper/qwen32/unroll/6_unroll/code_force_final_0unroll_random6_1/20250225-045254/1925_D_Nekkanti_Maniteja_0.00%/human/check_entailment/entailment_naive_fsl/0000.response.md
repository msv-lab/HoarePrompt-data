Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**: The code calculates `c` as `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs. However, this is not used correctly in the subsequent calculations. The probability of choosing a particular friend pair in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, but the code does not account for the different friendship values correctly.

2. **Incorrect Summation Logic**: The code attempts to sum the expected values but does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over the k excursions. The expected value for each friend pair should be calculated based on the probability of choosing that pair and the increasing friendship value, but the code does not do this correctly.

3. **Ignoring Individual Friendship Values**: The code sums up all the initial friendship values in `a` but does not differentiate between different pairs. It should calculate the expected contribution of each pair separately and then sum them up.

4. **Modular Arithmetic Errors**: The code does not handle modular arithmetic correctly in the summation part. The summation should be done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = (n * (n - 1)) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)  # Probability of choosing any pair
        expected_sum = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected value contribution of this pair
            expected_sum += (f * k + (k * (k - 1) // 2)) * prob
            expected_sum %= M
        
        # Contribution of non-friend pairs
        expected_sum += (total_pairs - m) * (k * prob) % M
        expected_sum %= M
        
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

This corrected version accounts for the probability of choosing each pair, the increasing friendship values, and handles modular arithmetic correctly.
