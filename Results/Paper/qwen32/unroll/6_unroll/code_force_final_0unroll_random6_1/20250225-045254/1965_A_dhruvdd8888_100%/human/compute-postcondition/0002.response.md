The code snippet `nums.add('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the set `nums`. The set `nums` initially contains the elements from the first line of input split by spaces. After adding `'0'`, the set `nums` will include this new element. The variable `N` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases and is not affected by the operation on `nums`.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, which represents the number of test cases; `nums` is a set containing the elements from the first line of input split by spaces, and additionally contains the string `'0'`.**
