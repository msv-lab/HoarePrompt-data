To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to carefully analyze the behavior of the variables `cw` and `nw` within the loop.

The loop iterates from the second last element of `nums` to the second element (inclusive), decrementing the index `i` in each iteration. The key operations within the loop are:
1. If `nums[i]` is equal to 1, `cw` is set to the negation of `nw`.
2. If `nums[i]` is not equal to 1, `cw` is set to `True`.
3. `nw` is then set to the value of `cw`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios for `cw` and `nw`:
- If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` becomes `not nw`, and then `nw` becomes `cw` (which is `not nw`).
- If `nums[i]` is not 1, `cw` becomes `True`, and then `nw` becomes `cw` (which is `True`).

To find the final state of `cw` and `nw`, we need to consider the sequence of operations. Since the exact values of `nums` are not given, we can reason about the final state based on the operations:
- If `nums[i]` is not 1 for any `i`, `cw` and `nw` will both end up being `True`.
- If `nums[i]` is 1 at any point, `cw` and `nw` will be flipped based on the value of `nw` at that point.

However, since the loop starts from the second last element and goes backward, and without specific values of `nums`, we can deduce the following:
- The final value of `cw` and `nw` depends on the sequence of `1`s and non-`1`s in `nums` from the second last to the second element.
- If there are no `1`s in this range, `cw` and `nw` will both be `True`.
- If there are `1`s, the final state will depend on the sequence, but we can't determine it without specific values.

Given the constraints and the lack of specific `nums` values, we can assume the simplest scenario where there are no `1`s in the range, leading to both `cw` and `nw` being `True`.

Thus, the output state remains:
Output State: **N is unchanged, nums is a list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements in the original sorted list, ls is the last element of the original sorted list, nw is True, cw is True.**
