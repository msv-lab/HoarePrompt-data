The code snippet `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each element in the `nums` set to an integer and then sorts the resulting list of integers. Since the initial state specifies that `nums` is a set containing the elements from the first line of input split by spaces and additionally contains the string `'0'`, after the execution of the code, `nums` will be a sorted list of these integers.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, which represents the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the first line of input split by spaces, including the integer `0`.**
