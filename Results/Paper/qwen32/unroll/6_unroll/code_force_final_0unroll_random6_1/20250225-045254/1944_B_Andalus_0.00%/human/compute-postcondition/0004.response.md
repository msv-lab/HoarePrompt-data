Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then prints up to `k` elements from the duplicates in the first half and second half of the array, and if necessary, from the singletons in the first half. The output for each test case is followed by a newline.**
