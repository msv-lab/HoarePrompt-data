Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5); `s` is a string of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise; `f` is a string of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `f` remain as described in the initial state since the provided code snippet only affects `t`.
