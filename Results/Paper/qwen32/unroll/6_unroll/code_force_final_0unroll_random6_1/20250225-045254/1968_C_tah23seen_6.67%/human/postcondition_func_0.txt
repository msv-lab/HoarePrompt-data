The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n-1` integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` of `n` integers. The first element of `ans` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element from index `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest number greater than `arr[i]` that is a multiple of `ans[i-1]` plus `arr[i-1]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.
