The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This means that the list `ans` will have `n` elements, all of which are set to 0. The other variables (`arr`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
