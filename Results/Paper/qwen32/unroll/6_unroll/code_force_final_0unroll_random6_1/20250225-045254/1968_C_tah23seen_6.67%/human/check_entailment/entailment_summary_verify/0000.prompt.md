You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n-1` integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` of `n` integers. The first element of `ans` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element from index `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest number greater than `arr[i]` that is a multiple of `ans[i-1]` plus `arr[i-1]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample where it fails.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `ans[0]`:**
   - The code initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This is not necessarily correct because the problem does not specify how to choose `a_1`. It only specifies the relationship between `a_i` and `a_{i-1}` for `i > 1`.
   - For example, if `arr[0]` is 1, then `ans[0]` is set to 2, which might not work for all subsequent elements.

2. **Logic for `ans[i + 1]`:**
   - The code sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]` and then checks if it is less than `arr[i + 1]`. If it is, it increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This logic is flawed.
   - Specifically, the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` is incorrect because `ans[i + 1]` should be such that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] == arr[i + 1]`. The current logic does not guarantee this.

3. **Final Element `ans[-1]`:**
   - The code sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, which again does not guarantee that `ans[-1] % ans[-2] == arr[-1]`.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
The expected output should be an array `a_1, a_2, a_3` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 == 1`
- `a_3 % a_2 == 1`

A valid output could be `2 3 4` or `100 101 102`, etc. However, the provided code will produce an incorrect result.

### Running the Code with the Counterexample:
If we input `1 3 1 1` into the provided code, the output might be something like:
```
2 3 4
```
However, the code's logic might produce something like:
```
2 3 2
```
which is incorrect because `2 % 3 != 1`.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large number (e.g., 10^9) and then compute the rest of the array based on the modulo condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases, and therefore, it is incorrect.
