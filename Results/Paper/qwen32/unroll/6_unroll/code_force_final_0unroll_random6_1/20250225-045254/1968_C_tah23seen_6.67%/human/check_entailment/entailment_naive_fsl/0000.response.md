Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample where it fails.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `ans[0]`:**
   - The code initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This is not necessarily correct because the problem does not specify how to choose `a_1`. It only specifies the relationship between `a_i` and `a_{i-1}` for `i > 1`.
   - For example, if `arr[0]` is 1, then `ans[0]` is set to 2, which might not work for all subsequent elements.

2. **Logic for `ans[i + 1]`:**
   - The code sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]` and then checks if it is less than `arr[i + 1]`. If it is, it increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This logic is flawed.
   - Specifically, the condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` is incorrect because `ans[i + 1]` should be such that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] == arr[i + 1]`. The current logic does not guarantee this.

3. **Final Element `ans[-1]`:**
   - The code sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, which again does not guarantee that `ans[-1] % ans[-2] == arr[-1]`.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
The expected output should be an array `a_1, a_2, a_3` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 == 1`
- `a_3 % a_2 == 1`

A valid output could be `2 3 4` or `100 101 102`, etc. However, the provided code will produce an incorrect result.

### Running the Code with the Counterexample:
If we input `1 3 1 1` into the provided code, the output might be something like:
```
2 3 4
```
However, the code's logic might produce something like:
```
2 3 2
```
which is incorrect because `2 % 3 != 1`.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large number (e.g., 10^9) and then compute the rest of the array based on the modulo condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases, and therefore, it is incorrect.
