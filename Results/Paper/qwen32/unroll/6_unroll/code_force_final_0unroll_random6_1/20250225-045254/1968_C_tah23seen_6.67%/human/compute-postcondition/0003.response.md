Let's analyze the loop and how it modifies the `ans` list.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of `n-1` integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`.
- `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`.
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `arr[0] + 1`.

The loop is:
```python
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
```

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `i` from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive):
     - `ans[i + 1]` is initially set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
     - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the inner `while` loop increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` becomes greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

**Effect of the Loop:**
- The loop ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than `arr[i + 1]` by starting with `ans[i] + arr[i]` and then adding `ans[i]` repeatedly until the condition is satisfied.
- Essentially, `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest number greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `ans[i] + k * arr[i]` for some integer `k >= 1`.

**Output State:**
- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
- For `i` from `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` will be the smallest number greater than `arr[i]` that is a multiple of `ans[i-1]` plus `arr[i-1]`.

Thus, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest number greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as `ans[i-1] + k * arr[i-1]` for some integer `k >= 1`.**
