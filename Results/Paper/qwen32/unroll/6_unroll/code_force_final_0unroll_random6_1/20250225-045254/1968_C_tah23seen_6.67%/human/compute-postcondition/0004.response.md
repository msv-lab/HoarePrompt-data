To solve this task, let's analyze the code snippet's impact on the variables based on the initial state provided. The initial state describes how the `ans` array is constructed up to the second last element (`ans[-2]`). The final element (`ans[-1]`) is defined as `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

Since the code snippet is not provided explicitly, we will assume that the last operation to be performed is the calculation of `ans[-1]` based on the given rule. Therefore, the only change in the output state will be the calculation of `ans[-1]`.

Here is the output state based on the provided information:

Output State: **`ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`; for `i` from `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` will be the smallest number greater than `arr[i]` that is a multiple of `ans[i-1]` plus `arr[i-1]`; `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]`**

In natural language, this means:
- The first element of `ans` remains as the first element of `arr` plus one.
- Each subsequent element of `ans` up to the second last element is calculated as the smallest number greater than the corresponding element in `arr` that is a multiple of the previous element in `ans`, plus the previous element in `ans`.
- The last element of `ans` is the second last element of `ans` plus the last element of `arr`.
