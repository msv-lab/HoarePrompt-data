The code snippet sorts the list `a` in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `counter` remain unchanged. The list `a` is modified to be in descending order based on its original values after each integer `a_i` was incremented by `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list `a` where each integer `a_i` is the original `a_i` plus `i + 1`, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that holds the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`.**
