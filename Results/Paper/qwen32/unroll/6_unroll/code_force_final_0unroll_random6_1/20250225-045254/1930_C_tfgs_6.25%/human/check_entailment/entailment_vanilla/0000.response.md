### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing the lexicographically largest array `b` from a set `S` where `S` is populated by the values `a_i + i` from the array `a`. The set `S` cannot contain duplicate values, and the array `b` is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Transformation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.
   - It then transforms each element `a_i` to `a_i + i + 1` and stores it back in `a`.

2. **Handling Duplicates and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each transformed value.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts it in decreasing order.

3. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique values of `a` (which are now in decreasing order).
   - For each unique value `a[i]`, it ensures that the previous value `a[i-1]` (if it exists) is added to `ans` the appropriate number of times to maintain the lexicographical order.
   - It then adds `a[i]` to `ans` and decrements its count in the `Counter`.
   - If there are still remaining counts (duplicates that were not added yet), it adds the last value in `ans` decremented by 1 until all counts are used up.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Transformation Step:** The transformation `a_i + i + 1` is correctly applied to each element of `a`.
- **Handling Duplicates:** The use of `Counter` and converting `a` to a set correctly handles duplicates.
- **Sorting:** Sorting the unique values in decreasing order ensures that the final array `b` will be in the correct order.
- **Constructing `b`:** The logic for constructing `b` ensures that the lexicographically largest array is formed by considering the counts of each unique value and maintaining the correct order.

The program correctly implements the required logic to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
