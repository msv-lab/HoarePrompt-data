### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a loop over possible values of \(b\) and calculating a sum based on certain conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and its annotations:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Annotations:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
- For each test case, it loops through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- It calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i(i-1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
- It checks if \(x\) is positive and adds it to the sum.
- It checks additional conditions and adds 1 more to the sum if they are met.
- Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is used in the calculation of `x`, but it should be `b` instead.
2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The conditions to add 1 more to the sum are incorrect and do not align with the problem description.
3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issues in the logic and conditions used to count the valid pairs.
