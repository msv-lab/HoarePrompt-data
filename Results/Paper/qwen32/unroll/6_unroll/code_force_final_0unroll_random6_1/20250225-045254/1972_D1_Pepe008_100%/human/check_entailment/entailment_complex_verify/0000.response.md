### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide a brief overview of the program's state and behavior. However, they do not delve into the correctness of the logic or the mathematical conditions being checked.

#### Analysis:
1. **Loop through each test case**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. **Loop through each possible value of \(b\)**: For each test case, it loops through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. **Calculate \(x\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i(i-1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
4. **Check if \(x\) is positive**: If \(x\) is positive, it adds \(x\) to the sum.
5. **Check additional condition**: If \((a - i(i-1)) \mod i^2 = 0\) and \(i(i-1) \mod i^2 = 0\), it adds 1 more to the sum.
6. **Print the result**: Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is used in the calculation of `x`, but it should be `b` instead.
- **Incorrect Conditions**: The conditions to add 1 more to the sum are incorrect and do not align with the problem description.
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with a simple example:

For the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The expected output is `3` based on the problem description, as the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), and \((2,2)\).

However, the provided program calculates:
- For \(b = 1\):
  - \(x = (2 - 1 \cdot 0) // 1^2 + 1 = 3\)
  - Since \(x > 0\), `suma += 3`
  - The condition \((2 - 1 \cdot 0) \mod 1^2 == 0\) and \(1 \cdot 0 \mod 1^2 == 0\) is true, so `suma += 1`
- For \(b = 2\):
  - \(x = (2 - 2 \cdot 1) // 2^2 + 1 = 0\)
  - Since \(x \not> 0\), no addition to `suma`
- For \(b = 3\):
  - \(x = (2 - 3 \cdot 2) // 3^2 + 1 = -1\)
  - Since \(x \not> 0\), no addition to `suma`

Thus, `suma = 4` and the output is `4 - 2 = 2`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
