Output State: **`T` is an input integer, each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the input, which is the number of test cases. The conditions related to the test cases (`n` and `m` values and their constraints) remain unchanged.
