### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally according to the rules specified. Let's break down the program and see if it correctly computes the MEX value.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - A frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` is created to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - This step is correct because it helps in determining how many times each number from `0` to `n-1` appears in the array.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program then iterates through the `freq` array to find the MEX.
   - It uses a counter `cou` to count the number of elements that appear exactly once in `arr`.
   - The loop continues until it finds either:
     - The first index `i` where `freq[i]` is `0` (indicating that `i` is not in `arr`).
     - The second index `i` where `freq[i]` is `1` (indicating that `i` appears exactly once in `arr`).
   - The loop prints the value of `i` when either of the above conditions is met, which correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach is correct because:
     - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it. Since both play optimally, the final array `c` will be constructed in a way that reflects this.
     - The MEX is determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c`, or if all smaller integers are present, the smallest integer that appears exactly once.
     - The provided loop correctly identifies this value by keeping track of the count of each integer and stopping when it finds the appropriate MEX.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the MEX for each test case based on the rules and optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
