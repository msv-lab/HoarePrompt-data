You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the first element of `arr` before the last sequence of that element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements using the operation described. If it's not possible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, the program should output -1.

### Program Analysis
Here's the breakdown of the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Initial Check for Uniform Array**:
    - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Segment Length**:
    - The program then iterates through the array to find the shortest segment of consecutive identical elements.
    - It keeps track of the length of the current segment of identical elements using `cnt`.
    - Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum length of the segments found so far and resets `cnt`.

4. **Output**:
    - After processing the array, if `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), it outputs `-1`.
    - Otherwise, it outputs `ans`, which is the length of the shortest segment of identical elements.

### Correctness Analysis
- The program correctly identifies if the array is uniform and outputs `-1` in such cases.
- However, the logic for finding the minimum segment length is flawed. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not the shortest segment of identical elements. The program should consider the possibility of removing elements to break the "beautiful" property, which might involve more complex logic than simply finding the shortest segment.

### Counterexample
Consider the array `[1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]`. The shortest segment of identical elements is of length 2, but removing just one element (either of the `2`s) would make the array non-beautiful. The program would output `2`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful in all cases. It incorrectly interprets the problem by focusing on the shortest segment of identical elements rather than the minimum removals required to break the "beautiful" property.
