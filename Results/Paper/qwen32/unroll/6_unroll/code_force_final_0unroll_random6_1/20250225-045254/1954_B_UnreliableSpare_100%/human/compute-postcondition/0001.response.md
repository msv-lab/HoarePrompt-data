The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet, nor is the list `a` as it is not involved in the code snippet provided.

Given that `n` is the input integer that specifies the number of integers to be read, and `arr` is assigned the list of integers from the input, the output state will reflect the new value of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
