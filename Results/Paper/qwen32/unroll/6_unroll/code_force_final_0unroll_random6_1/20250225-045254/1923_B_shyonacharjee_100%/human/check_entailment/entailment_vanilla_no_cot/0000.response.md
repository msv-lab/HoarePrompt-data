Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly determines if you can survive and kill all monsters. The main issue is that it does not correctly account for the movement of monsters over time. The program assumes that if the total bullets used by a certain point exceed the distance multiplied by the number of bullets you can fire per second, you cannot survive. However, this does not accurately reflect the game mechanics where monsters move closer each second.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            if health > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            k -= health // distance
            if health % distance != 0:
                k -= 1
            if k < 0:
                can_survive = False
                break
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
```

In this corrected version, the program checks if the health of each monster can be reduced to zero before it reaches the character, taking into account the number of bullets available per second and the distance the monster needs to cover. It also adjusts the number of bullets available for subsequent monsters based on how many were used to kill the previous ones.
