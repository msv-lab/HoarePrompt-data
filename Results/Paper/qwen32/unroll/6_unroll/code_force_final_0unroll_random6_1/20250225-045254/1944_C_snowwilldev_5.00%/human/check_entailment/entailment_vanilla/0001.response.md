To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the code and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or removing them from `a` (Bob).
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- We need to find the final score (MEX of `c`) if both players play optimally.

### Key Points:
- **MEX (Minimum Excludant)**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice will try to add elements to `c` that maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will try to remove elements from `a` to minimize the MEX.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
```

#### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Counting Elements**: The program counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.
2. **Tracking Unique Elements**: It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N-1` and keeps a count `t` of elements that appear exactly once.
3. **Determine MEX**:
   - If `t >= 2` or if an element `i` is not present in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), the program prints `i` as the MEX.

#### Issues in the Logic:
- **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. It directly calculates the MEX based on the initial counts, which does not account for the strategic moves of both players.
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`, which evolves as Alice and Bob make their moves. The program does not simulate this process.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly simulate the game or calculate the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
