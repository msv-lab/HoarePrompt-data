Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around a game played by Alice and Bob on an array `a`. Alice and Bob take turns selecting elements from `a` with Alice appending her selected element to an initially empty array `c` and then deleting it from `a`. Bob simply deletes his selected element from `a`. The game continues until `a` is empty. The score of the game is the MEX of `c` at the end of the game. Alice aims to maximize this score, while Bob aims to minimize it. Both players play optimally.

### Key Observations

1. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`. To do this, she should aim to include as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible, especially the smallest ones.
3. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`. To do this, he should try to prevent Alice from adding small non-negative integers to `c`.
4. **Turns and Elements**: Since Alice and Bob take turns, and Alice starts, the number of turns Alice gets is `(n + 1) // 2` and the number of turns Bob gets is `n // 2`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses a frequency dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. It then iterates through the integers from `0` to `n-1` and checks two conditions:
- If the count of the current integer is `1`, it increments a counter `t`.
- If `t` reaches `2` or the count of the current integer is `0`, it prints the current integer and breaks the loop.

### Correctness of the Solution

The logic behind the solution is that if there are at least two distinct integers in `a` that appear exactly once, then Alice can ensure that these two integers are included in `c` (since she has more turns than Bob). The smallest such integer is the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The solution does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob beyond just counting the single occurrences.
- Specifically, it does not consider the scenario where the smallest integer with a count of `1` might be blocked by Bob, or where Alice can strategically choose elements to maximize the MEX.

### Counterexample

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
0 0 1 2 2
```
- The counts are: `0 -> 2`, `1 -> 1`, `2 -> 2`.
- The solution will print `1` because it is the smallest integer with a count of `1`.
- However, Alice can play optimally to ensure that `c` includes `0` and `1`, making the MEX `2`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution does not correctly handle all scenarios and does not fully account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
