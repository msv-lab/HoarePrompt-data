### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The strategy revolves around counting the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and then finding the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`, which is determined by the moves made by Alice and Bob.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program’s logic and how it relates to the problem:

1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

2. **Determine MEX**: The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checks two conditions:
   - If the count of the current number `i` is exactly `1`, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If the counter `t` reaches `2` (meaning there are at least two unique elements that appear exactly once) or if the count of the current number `i` is `0` (meaning `i` does not appear in the array at all), it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

The key point here is that the MEX of the array `c` is determined by the smallest number that either does not appear in `a` or appears an odd number of times (since Alice will always append elements to `c` and Bob will remove elements from `a` but not add them to `c`). The strategy of checking for elements that appear exactly once or do not appear at all is correct because:
- If an element appears an even number of times, it will be completely removed by Bob, so it won't affect the MEX.
- If an element appears exactly once, it will be added to `c` by Alice, and hence will be part of determining the MEX.
- If an element does not appear at all, it will be the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

The program correctly implements this logic to determine the MEX. The execution summary also aligns with the expected behavior of the program.

### Conclusion:

Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

Correctness: **True**
