### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. Let's analyze the logic behind the program and see if it correctly computes the MEX under optimal play conditions.

1. **Counting Elements**:
    - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

2. **Determine MEX**:
    - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`. Since Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, the game essentially revolves around the uniqueness of elements in `c`.
    - The program iterates through the range `[0, N)` and checks two conditions:
        - If an element appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments a counter `t`.
        - If `t >= 2` (meaning there are at least two unique elements that appear exactly once) or if an element is missing (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints the current index `i` as the MEX.

3. **Optimal Play**:
    - Alice's optimal strategy is to pick elements that are unique or appear the fewest times, maximizing the chance of introducing new unique elements into `c`.
    - Bob's optimal strategy is to pick elements that are not unique, minimizing the chance of introducing new unique elements into `c`.
    - The program correctly identifies the smallest index `i` that either is missing from `a` or has already appeared an even number of times (since Alice and Bob will cancel out pairs of identical elements).

4. **Verification with Test Cases**:
    - **First Test Case**: `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
        - `cnt = {0: 2, 1: 2}`
        - The smallest `i` where `cnt[i] == 0` is `2`.
        - MEX is `2`.
    - **Second Test Case**: `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
        - `cnt = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
        - The smallest `i` where `t >= 2` is `1` (since `t` will be `1` after `0`, and `2` after `1`).
        - MEX is `1`.
    - **Third Test Case**: `a = [1, 1]`
        - `cnt = {1: 2}`
        - The smallest `i` where `cnt[i] == 0` is `0`.
        - MEX is `0`.

The logic correctly identifies the MEX for each test case based on the optimal play strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

**Correctness: True**
