You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then determines and prints the smallest index `i` such that either the count of `i` in the list `a` is zero or at least two unique elements in `a` appear exactly once.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the code and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or removing them from `a` (Bob).
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- We need to find the final score (MEX of `c`) if both players play optimally.

### Key Points:
- **MEX (Minimum Excludant)**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice will try to add elements to `c` that maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will try to remove elements from `a` to minimize the MEX.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
```

#### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Counting Elements**: The program counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.
2. **Tracking Unique Elements**: It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N-1` and keeps a count `t` of elements that appear exactly once.
3. **Determine MEX**:
   - If `t >= 2` or if an element `i` is not present in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), the program prints `i` as the MEX.

#### Issues in the Logic:
- **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. It directly calculates the MEX based on the initial counts, which does not account for the strategic moves of both players.
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`, which evolves as Alice and Bob make their moves. The program does not simulate this process.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly simulate the game or calculate the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
