### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the number of valid `k` values for which Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` fit the described pattern of "settling."

The program provided takes the following steps:
1. For each test case, it reads the values `n` and `x`.
2. It then checks two conditions:
   - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it computes the divisors of `n + x - 2` using the `func_1` function.
   - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it computes the divisors of `n - x` using the `func_1` function.
3. For each divisor `s` obtained from these computations, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`. If both conditions are true, it adds `(s + 2) / 2` to the list of possible `k` values.
4. Finally, it removes duplicates from the list of possible `k` values and prints the count of unique values.

The function `func_1(x)` computes all divisors of `x` and returns them in a specific order, with divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` appearing first, followed by divisors less than the square root of `x` in reverse order.

### Analysis:

Let's analyze whether the program correctly implements the logic to find valid `k` values:
- The program correctly identifies that `k` must be such that the pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
- It checks the two possible scenarios: `n + x - 2` and `n - x` to see if they are even, which would indicate a valid `k` could be derived from their divisors.
- It correctly computes the divisors and checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` by ensuring it is at least `x` and is an integer.
- It ensures that the final count of `k` values is unique by converting the list to a set before counting.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
