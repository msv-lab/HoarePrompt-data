Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues and does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is called but is not defined in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of k**: The logic for calculating the possible values of `k` is flawed. The code attempts to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, but this does not correctly determine the values of `k` that fit the problem description.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `x` is 1, the code should only consider `k` values that fit the pattern starting from 1, which is not correctly handled.

4. **Output Format**: The code converts the calculated values of `k` to floats and then to a set to remove duplicates. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def find_possible_ks(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):  # k must be greater than 1
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if k - (position_in_period - (k - 2) - 1) == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    print(find_possible_ks(n, x))
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible values of `k` and checks if the given position `n` and number `x` fit the described pattern. It correctly handles the periodic nature of the problem and ensures that all edge cases are considered.
