### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) such that a given position \( n \) in a line corresponds to a specific number \( x \) according to the described settling pattern. The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and within each segment, the numbers increase from 1 to \( k \) and then decrease back to 2.

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Divisor Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) using the `func_1` function. The function `func_1` computes all divisors of a given number \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.

3. **Condition Checking**: For each divisor \( s \) of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \), it checks if \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to \( x \). If both conditions are satisfied, it adds \( (s + 2) / 2 \) to the list of valid \( k \) values.

4. **Uniqueness and Output**: It ensures that the list of valid \( k \) values contains only unique elements by converting it to a set and then prints the length of this set.

### Analysis:

- **Divisor Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly computes all divisors of a given number \( x \) by iterating up to the square root of \( x \) and collecting both the divisor and its complement. This is an efficient way to find all divisors, especially given the large constraints (up to \( 10^9 \)).

- **Condition Checking**: The conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` are used to ensure that \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is a valid \( k \). Specifically, \( (s + 2) / 2 \) must be an integer (hence the modulo check) and it must be at least \( x \) because \( x \) is the number Vasya received, and \( k \) must be at least as large as \( x \).

- **Output**: The program ensures that the output is the count of unique valid \( k \) values by converting the list to a set before counting.

### Conclusion:

The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the divisors, checks the necessary conditions, and ensures that the output is the count of unique valid \( k \) values. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
