To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop for each test case based on the value of `n`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop processes each value of `n`:

1. **For `n > 52`:**
   - The word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - Since `alphabet` contains the letters 'a' to 'z', `n - 53` will be a valid index to access a letter in `alphabet` (considering 0-based indexing).

2. **For `28 <= n <= 52`:**
   - The word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - Here, `n - 28` will be a valid index to access a letter in `alphabet`.

3. **For `n == 27`:**
   - The word is explicitly set to `'aay'`.

4. **For `3 <= n <= 26`:**
   - The word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - Here, `n - 3` will be a valid index to access a letter in `alphabet`.

The loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration, it prints a word based on the value of `n` provided in that iteration. The final output state will be the sequence of printed words, one for each test case.

Since the output is a sequence of printed words and not a modification of the input variables `t` or `alphabet`, the output state can be described as the sequence of words printed by the loop.

Output State: **a sequence of words printed for each test case based on the value of `n`**.
