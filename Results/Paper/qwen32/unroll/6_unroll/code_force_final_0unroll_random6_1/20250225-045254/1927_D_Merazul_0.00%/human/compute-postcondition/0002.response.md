The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which is the first element of the tuple returned by the lambda function `R`. For the `while` loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a truthy value. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, while zero is considered falsy.

Given that `t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R`, we need to ensure that this first element is a non-zero integer. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`) are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, `t` must be set to a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n**
