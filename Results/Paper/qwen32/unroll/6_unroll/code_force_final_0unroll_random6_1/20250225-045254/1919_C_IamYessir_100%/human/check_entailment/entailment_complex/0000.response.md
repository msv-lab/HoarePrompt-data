### Reasoning:

The problem requires splitting the array into two subsequences such that the sum of penalties from both subsequences is minimized. The penalty of a subsequence is defined as the number of indices where the element at the next index is greater than the current element.

The provided code attempts to achieve this by iterating through the array and distributing elements into two lists, `a` and `b`, based on certain conditions. The conditions for distributing elements are not optimal for minimizing the penalty. Here are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The code checks the last elements of `a` and `b` and distributes the current element based on these values. However, this does not guarantee that the subsequences formed will have minimal penalties. The logic does not consider the global structure of the array and the potential benefits of different splits.

2. **No Guarantee of Minimum Penalty**: The code does not ensure that the subsequences formed have the minimal possible penalties. The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` do not consider the overall increasing trend of the array, which could result in higher penalties.

3. **Example Mismatch**: The code does not match the example outputs provided in the problem statement. For example, in the first test case, the code does not produce the output `3`, which is the expected minimum penalty.

### Correctness:

Given the issues with the logic and the lack of a guarantee that the minimum penalty is achieved, the code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
