To understand the output state, we need to analyze what the given Python code does. The code processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `lit` of `n` integers. It then populates two lists `a` and `b` based on certain conditions and finally calculates the sum `s` of the number of times the elements in `a` and `b` increase consecutively.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization**: Two empty lists `a` and `b` are initialized. `cp` is set to 0, but it is not used in the loop.

2. **First Loop (Populating `a` and `b`)**:
   - For each element in `lit`, the code compares the last elements of `a` and `b` (or `inf` if the lists are empty).
   - Depending on the comparison, it appends the current element of `lit` to either `a` or `b`.
   - The conditions ensure that the elements in `a` and `b` are distributed in a way that maintains certain order properties.

3. **Second Loop (Calculating `s`)**:
   - It counts the number of times the elements in `a` increase consecutively.
   - It counts the number of times the elements in `b` increase consecutively.
   - The sum `s` of these counts is printed.

Given this, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be the final value of `s` for each test case, which is printed out.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `t`, `n`, and `lit`, we can't compute a numerical output state. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the final printed value for each test case.

Output State: **The final value of `s` for each test case, which is the sum of the number of consecutive increasing elements in lists `a` and `b`.**
