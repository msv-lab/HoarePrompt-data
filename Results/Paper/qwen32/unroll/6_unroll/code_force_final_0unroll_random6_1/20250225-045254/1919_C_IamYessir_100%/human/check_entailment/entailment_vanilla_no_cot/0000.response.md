Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem. The logic for splitting the array into subsequences `s` and `t` does not ensure that the penalty is minimized. The program attempts to split the array based on the last elements of `s` and `t`, but this approach does not guarantee the optimal split that minimizes the total penalty.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it in a way that minimizes the number of ascending pairs in each subsequence. However, the given program does not follow this approach, and thus, it is incorrect.
