The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the input value.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the input value must be a positive integer. Given the problem statement, `t` (the number of test cases) is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. This means the loop will execute `t` times, and we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Since `t` is already provided as part of the initial state and is guaranteed to be within the specified range, the state does not need any additional adjustments regarding the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
