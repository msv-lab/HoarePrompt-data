You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) such test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n + 2 > k * 2:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
            print(1)
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The output state consists of the results of t test cases, each either printing 'YES' followed by two integers or 'NO'. The values of t, n, and k from the initial state are unchanged except that they have been processed through the loop. The state of other variables not mentioned in the loop remains the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants). For each test case, it determines if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins under specific conditions and prints 'YES' followed by two integers if possible, otherwise prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly as per the problem description. Specifically, it only handles two special cases:
1. When `n == k`, it sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
2. When `n + 2 > k * 2`, it sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1` coins per jewel.

However, the problem requires Bob to be able to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current program does not provide a general solution for arbitrary values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).

For example, consider the test case:
```
1
255 8
```
The program would output:
```
NO
```
But according to the problem description, the correct output should be:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```
This is because Alice can buy 1 jewel from each stall with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, spending a total of 255 coins and buying exactly 8 jewels.

The program needs to be able to handle a wide range of inputs and provide a valid configuration of stalls and prices for every possible combination of `n` and `k` that meets the requirements. The current implementation fails to do so for many cases.
