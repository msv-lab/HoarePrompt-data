Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of general cases**: The program only handles two specific cases:
   - When `n == k`, it sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - When `n + 2 > k * 2`, it sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1` coins per jewel.
   
   These conditions are not sufficient to handle all possible values of `n` and `k`. The problem requires a more general solution where Bob can set up to 60 stalls with appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **General solution**: To solve the problem correctly, Bob can use a greedy approach to set up stalls with decreasing prices. For example, he can start with the largest possible price and then decrease it in a way that allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to use powers of 2, as shown in the third example of the problem statement.

Here's a possible correct solution:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif k > n:
            print('NO')
        else:
            prices = []
            remaining_k = k
            while remaining_k > 0 and len(prices) < 60:
                max_affordable = n // remaining_k
                if max_affordable == 0:
                    break
                prices.append(max_affordable)
                n -= max_affordable
                remaining_k -= 1
            if remaining_k == 0:
                print('YES')
                print(len(prices))
                print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This solution iteratively assigns the highest possible price to each stall, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the number of stalls (60).
