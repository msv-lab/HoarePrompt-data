Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

### Conditions for the Output
1. **If `k == n`**: All cyclic shifts must be sorted. This is only possible if all elements of the array are the same. Hence, the array can be filled with any single integer (e.g., all `1`s).
2. **If `k == 1`**: Only one cyclic shift must be sorted. This can be achieved by arranging the array such that only one rotation is sorted. For example, the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have only its first rotation sorted.
3. **For `1 < k < n`**: No simple pattern exists that guarantees exactly `k` cyclic shifts will be sorted. The program should output `-1` for these cases.

### Program Analysis

The program handles the conditions as follows:
- If `k == n`, it outputs an array of `n` ones.
- If `k == 1`, it outputs an array of integers from `0` to `n-1`.
- For all other values of `k` (i.e., `1 < k < n`), it outputs `-1`.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `n = 2`, `k = 2`
   - **Output:** `1 1`
   - **Explanation:** All cyclic shifts (`[1, 1]` and `[1, 1]`) are sorted. This matches the condition `k == n`.

2. **Input:** `n = 3`, `k = 1`
   - **Output:** `69420 69 420`
   - **Explanation:** Only the first cyclic shift (`[69420, 69, 420]`) is sorted. This matches the condition `k == 1`.

3. **Input:** `n = 3`, `k = 2`
   - **Output:** `-1`
   - **Explanation:** No simple array can have exactly 2 out of 3 cyclic shifts sorted. This matches the condition `1 < k < n`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases. Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
