Let's reason through the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.
- If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program handles three cases:
1. **Case `k == n`**: It outputs an array of `n` ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`).
2. **Case `k == 1`**: It outputs the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
3. **Case `1 < k < n`**: It outputs `-1`.

#### Case-by-Case Validation:
1. **Case `k == n`**:
   - An array of all ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`) is trivially sorted.
   - All cyclic shifts of this array will also be sorted.
   - This satisfies the requirement for all `n` cyclic shifts to be sorted.
   - Thus, this case is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Case `k == 1`**:
   - The array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted.
   - Any cyclic shift of this array will not be sorted except for the original array itself.
   - This satisfies the requirement for exactly one cyclic shift to be sorted.
   - Thus, this case is correctly handled by the program.

3. **Case `1 < k < n`**:
   - The program outputs `-1`.
   - For `1 < k < n`, it is not straightforward to construct an array where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - The problem statement does not provide a simple construction for such cases.
   - Given the constraints and the problem description, it seems reasonable to assume that no simple solution exists for these cases.
   - Thus, outputting `-1` is a valid approach for these cases.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program handles all possible values of `k` from `1` to `n`.
- The constraints (`1 ≤ k ≤ n`) are fully covered.
- The program provides a clear and concise solution for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and provides valid outputs based on the problem requirements. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
