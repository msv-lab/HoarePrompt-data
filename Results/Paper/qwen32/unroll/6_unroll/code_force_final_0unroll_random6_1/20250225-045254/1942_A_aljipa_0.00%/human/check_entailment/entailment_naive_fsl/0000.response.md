Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only handles three cases:
1. When `k == n`, it returns an array of `n` ones.
2. When `k == 1`, it returns an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
3. For any other value of `k`, it returns `-1`.

However, the problem description requires constructing an array such that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted, which is not handled correctly for all values of `k` between 1 and `n`.

Let's consider a specific counterexample:
- **Input:** `n = 4, k = 2`
- **Expected Output:** An array such that exactly 2 out of the 4 cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 1]` has the following cyclic shifts:
  - `[1, 2, 3, 1]` (sorted)
  - `[2, 3, 1, 1]` (not sorted)
  - `[3, 1, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
  - `[1, 1, 2, 3]` (sorted)

- **Program Output:** `-1` (incorrect)

The program does not provide a valid array for `k = 2` when `n = 4`, thus it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
