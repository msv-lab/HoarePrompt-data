`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10³, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10³. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10³.**
