Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20 inclusive. It processes these strings using the function `func_1` and collects the results. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.**
