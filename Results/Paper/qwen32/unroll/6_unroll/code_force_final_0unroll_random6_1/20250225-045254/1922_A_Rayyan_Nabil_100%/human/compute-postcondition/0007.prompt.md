You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 20), a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: n is the integer value read in the last iteration, a is the string read in the last iteration, b is the string read in the last iteration, c is the string read in the last iteration, t is the same as the initial value, results is a list of results from each func_1 call.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: n is the integer value read in the last iteration, a is the string read in the last iteration, b is the string read in the last iteration, c is the string read in the last iteration, t is the same as the initial value, results is a list of results from each func_1 call.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, each being a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20 inclusive. The function returns a value based on the comparison or processing of these strings.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
