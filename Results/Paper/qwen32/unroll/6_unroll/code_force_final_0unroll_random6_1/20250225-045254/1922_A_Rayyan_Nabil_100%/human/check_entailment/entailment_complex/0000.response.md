### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while string `c` does not. 

#### Template Matching Rules:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be the same as the i-th letter of the template.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template.

#### Approach:
The function `func_1` checks if there exists at least one position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` such that:
- `a[i]` is different from `c[i]`
- `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`

If such a position exists, it means that we can construct a template where the i-th letter is uppercase (since both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`). This template would match `a` and `b` but not `c`. Therefore, `func_1` returns 'YES'. If no such position exists, it returns 'NO'.

#### Verification with Test Cases:
Let's verify the function `func_1` with the given test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 1`
   - `a = 'a'`
   - `b = 'b'`
   - `c = 'c'`
   - At position 0: `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]` are both true.
   - Expected output: 'YES'

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 2`
   - `a = 'aa'`
   - `b = 'bb'`
   - `c = 'aa'`
   - At position 0: `a[0] == c[0]` (false)
   - At position 1: `a[1] == c[1]` (false)
   - Expected output: 'NO'

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 10`
   - `a = 'mathforces'`
   - `b = 'luckforces'`
   - `c = 'adhoccoder'`
   - At position 0: `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]` are both true.
   - Expected output: 'YES'

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 3`
   - `a = 'acc'`
   - `b = 'abd'`
   - `c = 'abc'`
   - At position 0: `a[0] == c[0]` (false)
   - At position 1: `a[1] == c[1]` (false)
   - At position 2: `a[2] == c[2]` (false)
   - Expected output: 'NO'

The function `func_1` correctly handles these test cases. The function `func_2` properly processes multiple test cases and prints the results accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and produces the expected output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
