Output State: **arr is a list of integers; new_segment is [5, 6]; max_segment is [7, 4]; segments_variants is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [7, 4, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; max_sum is -1; total_max_segment is [-1]; the length of total_max_segment is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `total_max_segment` has been updated to `[-1]`, and its length is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
