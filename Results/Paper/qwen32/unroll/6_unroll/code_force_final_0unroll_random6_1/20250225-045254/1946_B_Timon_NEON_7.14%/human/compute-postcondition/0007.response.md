The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. This new segment is created by concatenating `new_segment` with a list containing the last index of `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`).

Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `new_segment` is [5, 6]
- `max_segment` is [7, 4]
- `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [7, 4, len(arr) - 1]]
- `max_sum` is -1

After the code execution:
- `segments_variants` will have an additional element, which is the result of `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, i.e., [5, 6, len(arr) - 1].

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [7, 4]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [7, 4, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1.**
