Postcondition: **arr is a list of integers; new_segment is [5, 6]; max_segment is [7, 4]; segments_variants is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [7, 4, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; max_sum is -1. If the length of total_max_segment is 1, then total_max_segment is [-1]. Otherwise, total_max_segment remains [7, 4].**
