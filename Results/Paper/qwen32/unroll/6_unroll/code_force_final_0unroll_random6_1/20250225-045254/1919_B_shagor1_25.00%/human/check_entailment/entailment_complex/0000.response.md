Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The program calculates and prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg` (where `neg` is the count of '-' characters), otherwise it prints `n`. This approach does not take into account the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty.

The correct approach involves finding an optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The current program does not perform any splitting or consider the penalties of subarrays, it simply calculates a value based on the count of '-' characters, which is not related to the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
