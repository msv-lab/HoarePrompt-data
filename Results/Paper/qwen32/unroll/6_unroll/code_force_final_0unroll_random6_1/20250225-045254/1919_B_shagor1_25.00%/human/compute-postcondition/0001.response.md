The code snippet `s = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variable `n` is already assigned the value of the first integer input for the current test case and remains unchanged. The string `s` will now hold the value of the second line of input for the current test case.

Output State: **`n` is a single integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.**
