### Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

The strategy used in the program is to construct the permutation such that:
- Even indices are filled with numbers in descending order starting from \( n \).
- Odd indices are filled with numbers in ascending order starting from 1 if \( n \) is odd, or 2 if \( n \) is even.

Let's analyze this strategy:

1. **Even Indices:**
   - The even indices are filled with descending numbers starting from \( n \).
   - This ensures that the numbers at even indices are larger and less likely to divide any numbers at odd indices.

2. **Odd Indices:**
   - The odd indices are filled with ascending numbers starting from 1 (if \( n \) is odd) or 2 (if \( n \) is even).
   - This ensures that the numbers at odd indices are smaller and less likely to divide any numbers at even indices.

#### Verification:
To verify that this strategy works, consider any two indices \( i \) and \( j \):
- If \( i \) and \( j \) are both even, \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) are both large numbers in descending order, and \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_{j+1} \) are both small numbers in ascending order. It's unlikely that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) unless \( p_i = p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} = p_{j+1} \), which is not possible since the numbers are distinct.
- If \( i \) and \( j \) are both odd, \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) are both small numbers in ascending order, and \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_{j+1} \) are both large numbers in descending order. Again, it's unlikely that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) unless \( p_i = p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} = p_{j+1} \), which is not possible.
- If \( i \) is even and \( j \) is odd (or vice versa), \( p_i \) is a large number and \( p_j \) is a small number, and \( p_{i+1} \) is a small number and \( p_{j+1} \) is a large number. It's even less likely that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Given the above analysis, the strategy ensures that the constructed permutation meets the problem's requirements.
