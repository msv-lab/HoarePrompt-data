### Reasoning:

The program constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` by filling the even indices in descending order starting from `n` and the odd indices in ascending order starting from either `1` or `2` depending on the parity of `n`. Let's analyze whether this approach guarantees the required condition: there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

1. **Even Indices (`p[0], p[2], p[4], ...`)**: These are filled in descending order starting from `n`. Given the descending order, larger numbers are placed at smaller indices. This ensures that for any `i` and `j` where `i < j` and both are even, `p_i > p_j`.

2. **Odd Indices (`p[1], p[3], p[5], ...`)**: These are filled in ascending order starting from `1` or `2`. This means that for any `i` and `j` where `i < j` and both are odd, `p_i < p_j`.

3. **Combining Even and Odd Indices**: The program ensures that even-indexed elements are generally larger than odd-indexed elements due to the descending and ascending order fill strategies. This helps in avoiding the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. Specifically:
   - If `i` and `j` are both even or both odd, the descending or ascending order ensures no such division condition can be met.
   - If `i` is even and `j` is odd (or vice versa), the larger even-indexed numbers and smaller odd-indexed numbers further reduce the likelihood of the division condition being satisfied.

Given the construction method, the program ensures that no two elements `p_i` and `p_j` and their subsequent elements `p_{i+1}` and `p_{j+1}` will meet the division condition. Therefore, the constructed permutation satisfies the problem's requirements.
