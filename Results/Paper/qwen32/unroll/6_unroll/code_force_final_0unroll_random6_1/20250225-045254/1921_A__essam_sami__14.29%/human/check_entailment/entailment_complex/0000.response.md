### Reasoning:

The program is intended to compute the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The area of a square can be determined by calculating the side length, which can be found by computing the Euclidean distance between two adjacent corners. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can also be found by simply computing the absolute difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent corners.

However, the provided program calculates the squared Euclidean distances between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the points being compared are adjacent corners of the square.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
3. It calculates the squared Euclidean distances between two pairs of points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`.
4. It prints the smaller of the two squared distances.

This approach is incorrect because:
- The squared distances calculated might not correspond to the side length of the square.
- The program does not correctly identify which pairs of points are adjacent corners of the square.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the four corners.
2. The side length of the square can be determined by the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates or y-coordinates.
3. The area of the square is the square of the side length.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the area of the square based on the given coordinates of its corners. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
