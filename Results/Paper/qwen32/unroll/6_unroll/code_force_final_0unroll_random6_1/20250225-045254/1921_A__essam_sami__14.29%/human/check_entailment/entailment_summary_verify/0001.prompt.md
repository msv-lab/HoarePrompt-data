You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. For each test case, the function calculates the squared distances between two pairs of these points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly computes the area of the square based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem describes a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Given four points, we need to compute the area of the square. The area of a square can be calculated as the side length squared. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent points.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads four points and computes the squared distance between pairs of points. It then prints the smaller of the two computed squared distances, assuming this represents the side length squared of the square.

### Steps in the Program
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read four points `(a, b)`, `(c, d)`, `(e, f)`, and `(g, h)`.
   - Compute the squared distance between `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` as `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
   - Compute the squared distance between `(c, g)` and `(d, h)` as `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`.
   - Print the smaller of `n` and `x`.

### Flaws in the Program
The program assumes that the smaller of the two computed squared distances represents the side length squared of the square. However, this is not necessarily true. The correct approach is to compute the squared distances between all pairs of points and identify the unique non-zero distances. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length squared should be the same for all pairs of adjacent points.

### Correct Approach
1. Compute the squared distances between all pairs of points.
2. Identify the unique non-zero squared distances.
3. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, there should be exactly two unique non-zero squared distances: the side length squared and the diagonal length squared. The side length squared is the smaller of the two.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly compute the area of the square because it does not consider all pairs of points and does not correctly identify the side length squared. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
