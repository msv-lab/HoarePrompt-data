You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts and prints the number of times the substrings "map" or "pie" appear as contiguous sequences within the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The program should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin letters.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through each test case, reads the string, and then checks for the substrings "pie" and "map". If it finds either of these substrings, it increments the `ans` counter and skips the next two characters (since the substring is of length 3). If the substring is not found, it moves to the next character.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Skipping Characters**: The program skips the next two characters after finding "pie" or "map". This is incorrect because removing one character from the string can potentially break another "pie" or "map" substring that starts at the next position. For example, in the string "mappie", removing the first "m" would result in "appie", which still contains the substring "pie". The correct approach would be to remove only one character and then check the new substring starting from the next position.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by removing one occurrence of "pie" or "map" at a time and then moving forward. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, in the string "mappie", removing the "m" from "map" would be optimal, but the program might remove the "p" from "pie" first, leading to a suboptimal solution.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It can produce incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
