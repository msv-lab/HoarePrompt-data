The given loop iterates over each element in the list `ans_f` and prints each element. Since the loop only prints the elements and does not modify the list or any other variables outside of its body, the state of `ans_f` remains unchanged after the loop completes.

Output State: **`ans_f` is a list containing the results of each test case, where each result is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs formed from the input list for that test case.**
