test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers, and the second element is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The length of test_cases is between 1 and 5000, inclusive.
