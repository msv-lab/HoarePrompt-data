The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ans_f` is an empty list**
