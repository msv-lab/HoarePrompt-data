Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum final score by optimally performing the n moves. There are several issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements**:
   - The code attempts to remove elements from the list `lst` using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always be `0` and `2` respectively, and the code will not correctly remove the first two elements in subsequent iterations.
   - The correct way to remove the first two elements would be `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)`.

2. **Handling of List Length**:
   - The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect. The loop should always pick the first two elements and remove them until the list is empty.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n * 2):` is incorrect because it tries to iterate `2n` times, but the list is being modified by removing elements in each iteration, so the loop should run `n` times instead.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to always pick the smallest elements first
        for _ in range(n):
            ans += lst.pop(0)  # Add the smallest element to the score and remove it
            lst.pop(0)  # Remove the next smallest element
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example input handling
# func()
```

In the corrected version:
- The list `lst` is sorted so that the smallest elements are always at the beginning.
- The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, the two smallest elements are added to the score and removed from the list.
- This ensures that the score is maximized by always adding the smallest possible values to the score.
