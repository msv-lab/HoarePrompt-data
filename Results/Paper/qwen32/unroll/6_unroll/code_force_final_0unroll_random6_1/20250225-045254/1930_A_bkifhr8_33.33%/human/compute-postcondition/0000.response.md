Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases. The initial state of the list of integers and the variable `n` for each test case remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet only reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. It does not affect the list of integers or the variable `n` which are part of the initial state for each test case.
