The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is provided at the start.
