You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves a series of slimes, each with a specific size. The slimes can eat their neighbors if they are strictly larger, and the goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds each slime will take to be eaten by another slime or determine if it will never be eaten.

### Program Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(a, x)`:
- This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first index in the list `a` where the value is greater than or equal to `x`.
- If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
- It returns the index + 1 if the value at that index is exactly `x`, otherwise, it returns the index.

#### Function `func_2(a, n)`:
- `left` is initialized with a 0, and `last` with -1. `ans` is initialized with -1 for all slimes.
- The `last` list is populated such that `last[i]` contains the index of the last slime with a different size than the current slime at index `i`.
- The `left` list accumulates the sizes of the slimes up to the current index.
- For each slime (starting from the second slime), the program checks if it can be eaten immediately by the previous slime. If so, it sets `ans[i]` to 1.
- If not, it calculates a value `x` which is the cumulative size of slimes up to the current one minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
- It then finds the index `inx` using `func_1` where the cumulative size is greater than or equal to `x`.
- It also considers the `last` list to find the last slime with a different size.
- If a valid index is found, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the slime to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

### Issues in the Program:
The provided program seems to have logical errors in how it calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten. The use of binary search and cumulative sums in this context does not align with the straightforward rules of the problem where a slime can only eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger.

#### Specific Issues:
1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search**: The binary search (`func_1`) is not correctly applied to the problem. The problem requires checking immediate neighbors, not cumulative sums.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The calculation of `x` and its use in `func_1` does not make sense in the context of the problem.
3. **Incorrect Use of `last` List**: The `last` list is not used effectively to check immediate neighbors.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves iterating through the slimes and checking each slime's neighbors directly. If a slime is strictly larger than its neighbor, it can eat the neighbor in one second. This process needs to be repeated until no more slimes can eat their neighbors.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
