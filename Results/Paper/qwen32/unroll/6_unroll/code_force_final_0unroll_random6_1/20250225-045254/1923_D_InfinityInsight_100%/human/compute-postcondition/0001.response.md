The code snippet assigns the list `[-1]` to the variable `last`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, and `left`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= len(a), `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integer -1.**
