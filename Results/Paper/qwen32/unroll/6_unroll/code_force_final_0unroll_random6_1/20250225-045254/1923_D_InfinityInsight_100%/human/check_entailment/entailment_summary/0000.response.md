### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or determine if it is impossible for a slime to be eaten. The provided solution consists of two main functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to compute the answer for each test case.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find the position of an element `x` in a list `a` using binary search (`bisect_left`). If `x` is found in the list, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` plus 1. If `x` is not found, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
   - Given the context, `func_1` seems to be used to find the position of a prefix sum that is just less than a certain value, which is relevant for determining the time it takes for a slime to be eaten.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function computes the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten by another slime.
   - It uses a prefix sum array `left` to store cumulative sums of slime sizes.
   - It also maintains an array `last` to store the last position where the slime size changed.
   - For each slime, if it is smaller than its previous neighbor, it can be eaten immediately (in 1 second).
   - If not, it uses the prefix sums and the `func_1` function to determine the earliest time the slime can be eaten by a larger neighbor.
   - The function returns a list `ans` where each element represents the minimum number of seconds for the corresponding slime to be eaten or -1 if it is impossible.

3. **Main Execution**:
   - The main execution part of the code processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the answer for the original list of slime sizes using `func_2`.
   - It also calculates the answer for the reversed list of slime sizes using `func_2` and then reverses the result.
   - For each slime, it takes the minimum of the two results or -1 if either result is -1.

### Analysis:
- The approach seems to correctly handle the problem by considering both forward and backward directions for each slime.
- By reversing the list and recalculating, the code ensures that all possible ways the process can go are considered.
- The use of prefix sums and binary search (`func_1`) helps efficiently determine the earliest time a slime can be eaten.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. It handles both the forward and backward directions and efficiently computes the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or determines if it is impossible.

**Correctness: True**
