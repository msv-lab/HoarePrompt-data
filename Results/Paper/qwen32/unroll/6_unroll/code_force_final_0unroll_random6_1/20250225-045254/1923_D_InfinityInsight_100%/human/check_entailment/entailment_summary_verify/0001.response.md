### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the given program against the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves a series of slimes with specific sizes. Each slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger. The goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds each slime will take to be eaten by another slime or determine if it will never be eaten.

#### Program Analysis:

##### Function `func_1(a, x)`:
- **Purpose:** This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first index in the list `a` where the value is greater than or equal to `x`.
- **Behavior:**
  - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
  - It returns the index + 1 if the value at that index is exactly `x`, otherwise, it returns the index.
- **Applicability:** This function is used to find a specific index in a sorted list. However, in the context of the problem, it seems less relevant since the problem involves checking immediate neighbors rather than cumulative sums.

##### Function `func_2(a, n)`:
- **Initialization:**
  - `left` is initialized with a 0, and `last` with -1. `ans` is initialized with -1 for all slimes.
- **Building `last` List:**
  - The `last` list is populated such that `last[i]` contains the index of the last slime with a different size than the current slime at index `i`.
- **Building `left` List:**
  - The `left` list accumulates the sizes of the slimes up to the current index.
- **Main Loop:**
  - For each slime (starting from the second slime), the program checks if it can be eaten immediately by the previous slime. If so, it sets `ans[i]` to 1.
  - If not, it calculates a value `x` which is the cumulative size of slimes up to the current one minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
  - It then finds the index `inx` using `func_1` where the cumulative size is greater than or equal to `x`.
  - It also considers the `last` list to find the last slime with a different size.
  - If a valid index is found, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the slime to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search:**
   - The binary search (`func_1`) is not correctly applied to the problem. The problem requires checking immediate neighbors, not cumulative sums.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`:**
   - The calculation of `x` and its use in `func_1` does not make sense in the context of the problem. The value `x` is calculated as `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, which does not directly correspond to any meaningful value in the context of the problem.
3. **Incorrect Use of `last` List:**
   - The `last` list is not used effectively to check immediate neighbors. It seems to be an attempt to track the last different slime size, but this is not directly useful for determining when a slime can eat its neighbor.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves iterating through the slimes and checking each slime's neighbors directly. If a slime is strictly larger than its neighbor, it can eat the neighbor in one second. This process needs to be repeated until no more slimes can eat their neighbors.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logical errors and incorrect use of data structures and calculations lead to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
