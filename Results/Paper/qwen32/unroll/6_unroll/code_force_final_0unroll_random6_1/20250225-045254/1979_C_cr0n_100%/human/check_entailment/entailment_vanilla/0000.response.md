To determine the correctness of the given program, let's walk through the logic and verify whether it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Given multipliers `k_i` for each outcome, the received amount for a winning outcome `i` is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on that outcome. The total bet is the sum of all `x_i`. The solution needs to ensure that for any `i`, `k_i * x_i > sum(x_j) for all j`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `func_1` function.
   - It then computes `vprod` as the LCM divided by each multiplier `k_i`, resulting in a list of integers.
   - It calculates `den` as the LCM minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bet distribution.

3. **Verification:**
   - The approach assumes that `vprod` values satisfy the condition because the LCM is the smallest number that is divisible by all `k_i`. By dividing the LCM by each `k_i`, we get a set of integers whose sum (when multiplied by `k_i`) can be compared with the LCM.
   - The check `den <= 0` ensures that the sum of `vprod` is less than the LCM, which means `k_i * vprod[i] > sum(vprod)` for any `i`.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify if the program satisfies the problem requirements:

- **Case 1:**
  - Input: `3 3 2 7`
  - Expected Output: `27 41 12`
  - The LCM of `3, 2, 7` is `42`. `vprod` becomes `[42/3, 42/2, 42/7]` which is `[14, 21, 6]`. The sum of `vprod` is `41`, and `den` is `42 - 41 = 1 > 0`. The output `[14, 21, 6]` works because `3*14=42 > 41`, `2*21=42 > 41`, and `7*6=42 > 41`.

- **Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 3 3`
  - Expected Output: `1 1`
  - The LCM of `3, 3` is `3`. `vprod` becomes `[3/3, 3/3]` which is `[1, 1]`. The sum of `vprod` is `2`, and `den` is `3 - 2 = 1 > 0`. The output `[1, 1]` works because `3*1=3 > 2` and `3*1=3 > 2`.

- **Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - The LCM of `5, 5, 5, 5, 5` is `5`. `vprod` becomes `[5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5]` which is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The sum of `vprod` is `5`, and `den` is `5 - 5 = 0`. The output `-1` is correct because no valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of bets exists and outputs the distribution if possible. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
