To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that the condition `remaining_vertices` is not empty when the loop starts. 

Given:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.

The loop condition is `while remaining_vertices:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

Since `remaining_vertices` is initialized as a set containing integers from 1 to n, it is not empty as long as `n` is at least 2. Given the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^5, `remaining_vertices` will always be non-empty.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `remaining_vertices` to ensure the loop can execute at least once. The state can be repeated as is.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**
