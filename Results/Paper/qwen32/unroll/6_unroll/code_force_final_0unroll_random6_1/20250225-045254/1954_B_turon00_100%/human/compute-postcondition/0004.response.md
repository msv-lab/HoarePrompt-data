Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of identical elements in the list `a`. If no such subarray exists or if the entire list consists of the same element, it returns `-1`. The results for each test case are printed sequentially.**
