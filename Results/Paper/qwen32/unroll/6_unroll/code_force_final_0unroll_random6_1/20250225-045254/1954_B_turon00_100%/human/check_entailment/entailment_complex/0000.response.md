### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic of the program is flawed based on the problem requirements. Here's why:

1. **Misunderstanding of the Problem**:
   - The program attempts to find the shortest contiguous subarray of identical elements and then uses its length to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. However, this approach does not guarantee that removing this subarray will make the array non-beautiful.
   - The problem requires identifying the minimum number of elements to remove such that the array can no longer be transformed into an array of identical elements using the given operation.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program incorrectly handles cases where the entire array consists of the same element. It correctly outputs `-1` in such cases, but it also outputs `-1` when the shortest contiguous subarray of identical elements has the same length as the entire array, which is incorrect.

3. **Flawed Logic**:
   - The core logic of the program is flawed because it does not consider the structure of the array and the operations allowed to make all elements the same. The program's approach does not account for the possibility of multiple contiguous segments of identical elements interspersed with other elements.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
