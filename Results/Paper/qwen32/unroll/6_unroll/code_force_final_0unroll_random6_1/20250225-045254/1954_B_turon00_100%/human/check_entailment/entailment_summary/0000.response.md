### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed for the array to stop being beautiful. According to the problem statement, an array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`) such that `a[i - 1] = a[i + 1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i - 1]`.

The key observation is that if there is any contiguous subarray of identical elements that is not the entire array, removing all but one element of this subarray will make the array non-beautiful. The goal is to find the shortest such subarray.

Here's the breakdown of the program's logic:
- It iterates through each test case.
- For each array, it counts the length of contiguous segments of identical elements.
- It keeps track of the shortest segment length found.
- If the shortest segment length is the length of the entire array or if the array has only one element, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
- Otherwise, it prints the length of the shortest segment, as removing all but one element of this segment will make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis:

Let's verify the logic against the examples:

1. **First Test Case:** `3\n2 2 2`
   - The array is entirely made up of the same element, so the shortest segment length is `3`.
   - Since the shortest segment length equals the length of the array, the output is `-1`.

2. **Second Test Case:** `5\n1 2 1 2 1`
   - The array has multiple segments of identical elements: `[1], [2], [1], [2], [1]`.
   - The shortest segment length is `1`.
   - Removing one element from this segment (e.g., the second `1`) will make the array non-beautiful, so the output is `1`.

3. **Third Test Case:** `1\n1`
   - The array has only one element, so the output is `-1`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:** `7\n3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - The array has segments: `[3, 3, 3], [5], [3, 3, 3]`.
   - The shortest segment length is `1` (the segment `[5]`).
   - Removing the `5` will make the array non-beautiful, but the program actually finds the shortest segment of identical elements, which is `3` (the segments of `3`), and outputs `3`, which is correct as removing three `3`s will make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the shortest segment of identical elements and determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The execution summary aligns with the intended solution.

**Correctness:** **True**
