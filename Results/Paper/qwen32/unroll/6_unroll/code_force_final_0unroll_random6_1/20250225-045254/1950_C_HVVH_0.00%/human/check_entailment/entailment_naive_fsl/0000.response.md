Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a logical error in determining the AM/PM designation for certain hours. Specifically, the code incorrectly sets the day to 'AM' when the hour is 12, which should be 'PM'. This happens due to the incorrect placement of the `day = 'AM'` line inside the `else` block.

Here is a problematic case:
- Input: `12:00`
- Expected Output: `12:00 PM`
- Actual Output: `12:00 AM`

To fix this, the code should be modified to correctly handle the case when the hour is 12. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

In this corrected version, the `day = 'AM'` is set by default, and then it is changed to 'PM' only when the hour is greater than 12 or exactly 12. This ensures that `12:00` is correctly formatted as `12:00 PM`.
