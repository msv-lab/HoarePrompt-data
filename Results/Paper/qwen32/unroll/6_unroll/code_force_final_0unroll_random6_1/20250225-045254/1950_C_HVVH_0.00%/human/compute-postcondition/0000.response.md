The code snippet provided simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. No other variables are affected or changed by this code. Therefore, the state of `t` and the strings `s` representing the times remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where the first two characters `hh` represent the hour from 00 to 23, and the last two characters `mm` represent the minute from 00 to 59; `day` is `'AM'`.**
