Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where the first two characters `hh` represent the hour from 00 to 23, and the last two characters `mm` represent the minute from 00 to 59; `day` is `'AM'`; `n` is an input integer.**

In simple terms: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an input integer, while the values of `t`, `s`, and `day` remain unchanged.
