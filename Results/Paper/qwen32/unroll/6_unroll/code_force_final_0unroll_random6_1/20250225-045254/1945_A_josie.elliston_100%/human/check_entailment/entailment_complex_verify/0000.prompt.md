You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

for _ in range(test_case_n):
    (introverts, extroverts, universals) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    print(func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))

            return None

        #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers, the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is 3 or greater
    #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, then the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is 3 or greater.

It returns `None` if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns -1 if `ret` is None; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns the sum of introverts and the result of another function call (`func_1(extroverts, universals)`), unless that result is `None`, in which case it returns -1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis

The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences. The program provided consists of two functions:

1. `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:
   - This function attempts to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the sum of extroverts and universals is less than 3. If this condition is met, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts).
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

2. `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1 (indicating it's impossible to accommodate the participants).
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

### Checking for Correctness

Let's go through some test cases to verify if the program works as expected:

#### Test Case 1: `1 2 3`
- Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
- Expected Output: 3
- `func_1(2, 3)` should return `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`
- `func_2(1, 2, 3)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 2: `1 4 1`
- Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
- Expected Output: -1
- `func_1(4, 1)` should return `None` because `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3`
- `func_2(1, 4, 1)` should return `-1`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 3: `1 4 2`
- Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 2
- Expected Output: 3
- `func_1(4, 2)` should return `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = 2`
- `func_2(1, 4, 2)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 4: `1 1 1`
- Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 1, Universals: 1
- Expected Output: -1
- `func_1(1, 1)` should return `None` because `1 % 3 != 0` and `1 % 3 + 1 < 3`
- `func_2(1, 1, 1)` should return `-1`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 5: `1 3 2`
- Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 3, Universals: 2
- Expected Output: 3
- `func_1(3, 2)` should return `ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = 2`
- `func_2(1, 3, 2)` should return `1 + 2 = 3`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 6: `19 7 18`
- Introverts: 19, Extroverts: 7, Universals: 18
- Expected Output: 28
- `func_1(7, 18)` should return `ceil((7 + 18) / 3) = 9`
- `func_2(19, 7, 18)` should return `19 + 9 = 28`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 7: `0 0 0`
- Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
- Expected Output: 0
- `func_1(0, 0)` should return `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = 0`
- `func_2(0, 0, 0)` should return `0 + 0 = 0`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 8: `7 0 0`
- Introverts: 7, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
- Expected Output: 7
- `func_1(0, 0)` should return `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = 0`
- `func_2(7, 0, 0)` should return `7 + 0 = 7`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 9: `0 24 0`
- Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 24, Universals: 0
- Expected Output: 8
- `func_1(24, 0)` should return `ceil((24 + 0) / 3) = 8`
- `func_2(0, 24, 0)` should return `0 + 8 = 8`
- **Result**: Correct

#### Test Case 10: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
- Introverts: 1000000000, Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000
- Expected Output: 1666666667
- `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` should return `ceil((1000000000 + 1000000000) / 3) = 666666667`
- `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` should return `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667`
- **Result**: Correct
