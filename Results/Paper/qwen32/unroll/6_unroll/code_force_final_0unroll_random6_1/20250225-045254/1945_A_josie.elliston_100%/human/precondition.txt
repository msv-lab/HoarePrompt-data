The function `f` is incorrectly defined according to the problem description. The correct function should take three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, all of which are non-negative integers (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9). The function should return an integer representing the minimum number of tents needed or -1 if it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
