Output State: **The program returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**

Given the conditions:
- `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers.
- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is 3 or greater.

This means the return value will always be the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.
