### Reasoning:

The provided function aims to solve the problem by counting the number of free cells (0s) in the middle of the chip arrangement after removing any leading and trailing free cells. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the function:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The function removes all leading zeros by repeatedly popping the first element of the list `a` if it is zero.
   - It then removes all trailing zeros by repeatedly popping the last element of the list `a` if it is zero.

3. **Counting Middle Zeros:**
   - After removing the leading and trailing zeros, the function counts the number of zeros remaining in the list `a`. This count is stored in the variable `res`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the count of middle zeros for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **Objective:** The goal is to move all chips into a single contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. Each operation consists of moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left.
- **Solution Strategy:** The solution strategy correctly identifies that the minimum number of operations required is equal to the number of free cells (0s) that need to be filled to make the chips contiguous. By removing leading and trailing zeros, the function focuses only on the middle section of the list where the chips need to be moved to form a contiguous block.
- **Correctness of Counting:** The function correctly counts the number of zeros in the middle section of the list after removing the leading and trailing zeros, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations required.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block. Therefore, the function is correct.

**Correctness: True**
