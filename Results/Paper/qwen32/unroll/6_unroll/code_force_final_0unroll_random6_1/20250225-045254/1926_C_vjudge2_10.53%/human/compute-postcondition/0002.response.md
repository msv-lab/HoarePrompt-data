The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a common placeholder for a variable that we don't plan to use, the only variable we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `numbers` is irrelevant to the execution of the loop itself, as it is not used in the loop head.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` should be set to a value greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `numbers` is an empty list**
