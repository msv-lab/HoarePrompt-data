To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand how the loop operates. The loop iterates over each integer `n` in the `numbers` list and prints the corresponding value from the `sum_values` list at index `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `numbers` is a list of integers.
- `values` and `sum_values` are predefined lists.
- `total` is an integer.

The loop code:
```python
for n in numbers:
    print(sum_values[n])
```

The `sum_values` list is:
```
[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 51, 55, 60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100, 102]
```

The `numbers` list contains integers that will be used as indices to access `sum_values`.

Since the loop only prints values from `sum_values` based on the indices in `numbers`, and does not modify any other variables, the state of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total` remains unchanged.

The output of the loop will be a series of printed values from `sum_values` corresponding to each index in `numbers`.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop will print a series of values from the `sum_values` list based on the indices provided in the `numbers` list, and the state of all other variables (`t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, `total`) remains unchanged.

Since the specific `numbers` list is not provided, we cannot list the exact printed values, but we can describe the state as follows:

Output State: **The loop prints values from `sum_values` based on indices in `numbers`; `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total` remain unchanged.**
