To determine if the provided Python program is correct for the given problem, we need to analyze the logic and see if it correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operations.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to sort a binary string (a string consisting of '0's and '1's) in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift operation is the length of the substring being shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted string.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
3. It counts the total number of '0's in the string (`zeroes`).
4. It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far and a variable `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
5. It iterates through the string `s`:
   - If the current character `c` is '0', it adds 1 to the total cost if there have been any '1's encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the current character `c` is '1', it adds the number of remaining '0's to the total cost (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).
6. Finally, it prints the accumulated cost for each test case.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if this logic correctly computes the minimum cost:

- The key idea is that each '1' encountered after the first '0' requires a shift to bring it to the end of the string, and each '0' encountered after a '1' requires a shift to bring all preceding '1's to the beginning of the string.
- The program correctly counts the number of '1's encountered before each '0' and adds this count to the total cost.
- The program also correctly counts the number of '0's remaining after each '1' and adds this count to the total cost.
- This ensures that each '1' is moved to the end of the string and each '0' is moved to the beginning of the string with the minimum cost.

### Conclusion

The program's logic correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operations.

Correctness: **True**
