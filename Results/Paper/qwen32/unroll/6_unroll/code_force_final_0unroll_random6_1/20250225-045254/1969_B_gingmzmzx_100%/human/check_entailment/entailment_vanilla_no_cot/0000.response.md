Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the specified operations. The logic in the program does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts correctly. Instead, it seems to be trying to count some transitions, but this approach does not align with the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, one must consider the cost of shifting substrings to move all '1's to the end and all '0's to the beginning. The provided solution does not perform this calculation accurately.
