### Reasoning:
The provided program calculates the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The logic used in the program is as follows:
1. For each binary string, it counts the total number of 0s.
2. It iterates through the string while maintaining a count of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
3. For each 0 encountered, it adds to the total cost the number of 1s that have appeared before it.
4. For each 1 encountered, it adds to the total cost the number of 0s that have not yet appeared.

This logic is correct because:
- Each 0 contributes to the cost based on the number of 1s that have appeared before it because those 1s need to be shifted to the right of the current 0.
- Each 1 contributes to the cost based on the number of 0s that have not yet appeared because those 0s need to be shifted to the left of the current 1.

The example provided in the problem description aligns with this logic:
- For the input "10", the cost is 2 because shifting the entire string "10" to "01" incurs a cost of 2.
- For the input "0000", the cost is 0 because the string is already sorted.
- For the input "11000", the cost is 9, which can be calculated by following the described logic.
- For the input "101011", the cost is 5.
- For the input "01101001", the cost is 11.
