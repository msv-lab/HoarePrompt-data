### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads a binary string. It then calculates the minimum cost to sort the string using the following logic:

1. **Count the zeroes**: The program first counts the number of zeroes in the string.
2. **Initialize counters**: Two counters are initialized, `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]`, to count the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
3. **Calculate the cost**: The program iterates through the string and for each character:
   - If the character is a '0', it checks if there have been any '1's encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). If there have, it increments the cost by 1 because shifting this '0' to the left past the last '1' encountered will cost 1.
   - If the character is a '1', it adds the number of zeroes that have not yet been encountered (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost. This is because shifting this '1' to the right past all the remaining zeroes will cost the number of remaining zeroes.

Let's analyze the logic in the context of the problem:

- **Zeroes and Ones**: The cost calculation is based on the observation that moving a '0' to the left past a '1' or moving a '1' to the right past a '0' incurs a cost. The number of such operations needed is equivalent to the number of inversions in the binary string.
- **Cost Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the number of inversions in the binary string, which corresponds to the minimum cost to sort the string using the allowed operations.

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order by counting the number of inversions, which is equivalent to the minimum cost of cyclic shifts required.
