Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. For each test case, it receives a binary string `s` with a length between 2 and 200,000, and the total length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a result for each test case based on the properties of the binary string `s`.**
