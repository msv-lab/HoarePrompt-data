Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. The logic in the program seems to be based on finding the maximum subarray sum and then using it in a way that does not align with the problem description.

The problem requires us to perform exactly `k` operations where in each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

The provided program calculates the maximum subarray sum using a variation of Kadane's algorithm and then uses this maximum subarray sum in a formula that does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem.

A more correct approach would involve:
1. Finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
2. If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can repeatedly insert this sum into the array to maximize the total sum.
3. If the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative, the optimal strategy is to insert zeros (i.e., empty subarrays) to avoid decreasing the sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_subarray_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        total_sum = 0
        for ele in l:
            current_sum = max(ele, current_sum + ele)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_sum)
            total_sum += ele
        
        if max_subarray_sum > 0:
            # If max_subarray_sum is positive, we can repeatedly add it
            result = (total_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD
        else:
            # If max_subarray_sum is zero or negative, we just add the total sum
            result = total_sum % MOD
        
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program correctly handles the problem requirements by using the maximum subarray sum appropriately and considering the modulo operation.
