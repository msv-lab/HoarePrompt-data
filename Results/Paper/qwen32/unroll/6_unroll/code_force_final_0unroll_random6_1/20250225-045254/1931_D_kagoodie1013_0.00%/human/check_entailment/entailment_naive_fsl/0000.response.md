Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Polycarp considers a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 \(\le\) i < j \(\le\) n) beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program is supposed to count all such beautiful pairs in the array \(a\).

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program uses a strategy based on modular arithmetic to count the beautiful pairs efficiently.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. For each test case, it initializes two dictionaries: `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.
2. It iterates through each number in the array:
   - It calculates `mod_x` as \(-num \% x\) and `mod_y` as `num \% y`.
   - It increments the count by the number of elements seen so far that have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It updates the counts in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the current number's `mod_x` and `mod_y`.

### Key Points to Verify:
- The program should correctly count pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
- The use of \(-num \% x\) for `mod_x` seems unusual and might need verification.

### Verification:
Let's consider the conditions for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\):
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

The program's logic:
- Uses `mod_x = -num % x` to check for \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- Uses `mod_y = num % y` to check for \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

However, the program's approach of using `mod_x = -num % x` might not be correct. The correct approach should be to use `mod_x = a_i % x` and `mod_y = a_i % y` and then check for the corresponding conditions in the maps.

### Example Case to Test:
Let's consider a simple case:
- \(n = 4\), \(x = 3\), \(y = 2\)
- \(a = [1, 2, 4, 5]\)

Beautiful pairs:
- \(\langle 1, 3 \rangle\): \(1 + 4 = 5\) (not divisible by 3), \(1 - 4 = -3\) (divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\): \(1 + 5 = 6\) (divisible by 3), \(1 - 5 = -4\) (not divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\): \(2 + 4 = 6\) (divisible by 3), \(2 - 4 = -2\) (divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 2, 4 \rangle\): \(2 + 5 = 7\) (not divisible by 3), \(2 - 5 = -3\) (divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 3, 4 \rangle\): \(4 + 5 = 9\) (divisible by 3), \(4 - 5 = -1\) (not divisible by 2)

Only \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\) is a beautiful pair.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the above example:
- Input: `1 4 3 2 1 2 4 5`
- Expected Output: `1`

Running the program with this input:
- The program incorrectly counts pairs based on the flawed logic of `mod_x = -num % x`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating `mod_x`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates `mod_x` as \(-num \% x\) instead of `num \% x` for checking the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\). This leads to incorrect counting of beautiful pairs.
