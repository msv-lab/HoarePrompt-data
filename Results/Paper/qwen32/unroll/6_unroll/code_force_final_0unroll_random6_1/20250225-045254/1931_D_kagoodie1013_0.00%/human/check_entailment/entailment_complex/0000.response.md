### Reasoning:

The program aims to count the number of beautiful pairs (i, j) in the array `a` for each test case, where a pair is considered beautiful if:
1. \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \).
2. \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \).

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `a` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of `a` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - It then iterates through each element `num` in the array `a`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element `num`, it calculates:
     - `mod_x = -num % x`
     - `mod_y = num % y`
   - It then increments the count by the number of elements already seen that have a remainder `mod_x` when divided by `x` and a remainder `mod_y` when divided by `y`.
   - It updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's remainders.

4. **Key Issue:**
   - The calculation for `mod_x` is incorrect. The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful is that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`, which translates to `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` or `a_i % x == -a_j % x`. The correct way to handle this is to use `mod_x = num % x` and check against `-num % x` in the map.
   - The current implementation incorrectly uses `-num % x` for both conditions, which does not correctly identify pairs where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count beautiful pairs based on the conditions given in the problem statement. Specifically, the calculation of `mod_x` is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
