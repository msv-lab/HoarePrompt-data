Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by using two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of elements' remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the remainder for `mod_x`. The correct calculation should be `num % x` instead of `-num % x`. The current implementation uses `-num % x`, which can lead to incorrect results because the negative sign changes the remainder.

To determine if a pair `(i, j)` is beautiful, the conditions are:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`, which is equivalent to `a_i % x == -a_j % x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`, which is equivalent to `a_i % y == a_j % y`.

The current code incorrectly calculates `-num % x` for `mod_x`. This can result in incorrect counts because the negative sign flips the remainder, leading to mismatches when checking for pairs that satisfy the first condition.

To fix this, we should use `num % x` for `mod_x` instead of `-num % x`. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
mod_x = num % x
mod_y = num % y
count += mod_x_map.get(-mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
mod_x_key = num % x
mod_y_key = num % y
mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
```

However, the original code provided does not make this correction, and therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
