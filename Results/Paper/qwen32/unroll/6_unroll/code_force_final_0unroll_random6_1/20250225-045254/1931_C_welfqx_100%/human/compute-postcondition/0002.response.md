To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Outer Loop (`for r in range(t)`):**
   - This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the following steps are executed:

2. **Inner Logic:**
   - `n` is the number of integers in the list `num`.
   - `num` is a list of `n` integers.
   - The first part of the logic checks if all elements in `num` are the same. If they are, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - If not all elements are the same, it proceeds to find the longest contiguous segment of identical numbers from the start (`cn`) and from the end (`ck`) of the list.
   - It also checks if the first and last elements of the list are the same. If they are, it combines the counts of the contiguous segments from the start and end.
   - Finally, it prints `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum number of deletions required to make all elements in the list the same.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - After all `t` test cases are processed, the output will be a series of numbers, each corresponding to the result of one test case.
   - The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `num`, `f`, `onum`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` will be based on the last iteration of the loop, but since the problem asks for the output state, we focus on the printed results.

Since the output is a series of numbers printed for each test case, the output state can be described as a list of these results.

Output State: **a list of integers where each integer is the result of one test case, representing the minimum number of deletions required to make all elements in the list the same.**
