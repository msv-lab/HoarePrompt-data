Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The program only considers the longest prefix and suffix of the array that consists of the same number and calculates the minimum cost based on that. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to use the operation to make all elements equal with the least cost, especially when the optimal solution involves changing a segment in the middle of the array.

For example, in the test case `6 1 2 3 4 5 1`, the program would incorrectly output `4` instead of the correct answer `4`. While the program correctly identifies that the entire array needs to be changed, it does not consider that changing the middle segment `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1` would also cost `4` burles, which is the same as the correct answer. However, in more complex cases, the optimal segment to change might not be the prefix or suffix, and the program would fail to find it.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible segments and their costs, or using a more sophisticated algorithm to determine the minimum cost efficiently.
