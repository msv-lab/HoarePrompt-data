You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

- Program:
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush
#Function 1:
def func_1(row, d: int):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
    min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1

    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):

    print(min(total_costs))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads a grid configuration defined by the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It calculates a cost for each row using `func_1` and then determines the minimum total cost of selecting `k` consecutive rows' costs. The final output is this minimum total cost.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis:

**Problem Description Recap:**
- **Objective:** Build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of an `n x m` grid (river) such that each bridge spans from the first column to the last column with supports at most `d` distance apart.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a[i, j] + 1`.
- **Constraints:** 
  - First and last columns have depth `0`.
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns.
  - Distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- **Output:** Minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a single bridge on a given row.
   - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row with values `a[i, j] + 1` and uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to the current column.
   - The function ensures that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, dimensions of the grid, number of bridges, and maximum distance between supports.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and returns the minimum total cost.

### Potential Issues:

- **Consecutive Rows Constraint:** The program correctly calculates the cost for each row individually and then sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows. However, it does not explicitly check if the supports in consecutive rows are placed in a manner that respects the `d` distance constraint between rows. This could be a potential issue if the problem requires that supports in consecutive rows are also within `d` distance apart.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles the edge case where `k = 1` correctly by simply finding the minimum cost for a single row. It also handles the case where `k > 1` by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where `k = n`, which means building bridges on all rows.

### Conclusion:

The provided program seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows based on the given problem description. However, there is a potential issue with the assumption that supports in consecutive rows do not need to respect the `d` distance constraint between rows. If this is indeed a requirement, the program is incorrect. Otherwise, based on the provided examples and the problem description, the program appears to work correctly.

Since the problem description does not explicitly mention the constraint on supports between consecutive rows, we will assume that the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by first computing the cost for each row individually and then finding the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases that it fails to address.
