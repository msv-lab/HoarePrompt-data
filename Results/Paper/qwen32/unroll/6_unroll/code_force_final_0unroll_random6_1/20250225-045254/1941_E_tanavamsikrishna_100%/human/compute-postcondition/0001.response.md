The given code snippet is responsible for updating the `rows` variable by reading `n` lines of input, where each line contains space-separated integers. These integers are converted to a list of integers and stored as sublists in the `rows` list.

Initial State: 
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `k` is the third input integer.
- `d` is the fourth input integer.
- `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid with the first and last elements being 0 and the rest being non-negative integers.

Given Code:
```python
rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
```

Impact:
- The variable `rows` is reassigned to a new list of lists.
- Each sublist in `rows` corresponds to a line of input, split by spaces and converted to integers.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row of `n` space-separated integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the `rows` variable now holds `n` lists of integers, each list corresponding to a line of input provided. The other variables (`m`, `k`, `d`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
