You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns, k is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, d is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, and rows is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid with the first and last elements being 0 and the rest being non-negative integers.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row of `n` space-separated integers read from the input, `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every possible `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every possible k consecutive elements from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), `k` (number of bridges), `d` (maximum distance between supports), and `rows` (a 2D list representing the grid). The function returns a value based on the given constraints, which likely involves checking the placement and number of bridges and supports in the grid.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
