The provided code snippet initializes an empty list called `total_costs`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, or `costs`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `total_costs` list, which starts as an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row of `n` space-separated integers read from the input, `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is an empty list.**
