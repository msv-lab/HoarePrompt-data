### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the program and identifies a potential issue regarding the placement of supports across consecutive rows. However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the supports in consecutive rows must also be within `d` distance apart. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided examples, the program appears to be correctly calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

Let's break down the key points:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the cost of building a single bridge on a given row.
   - It ensures that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
   - The function initializes the first `d` elements and uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to the current column.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input and calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and returns the minimum total cost.

3. **Potential Issue:**
   - The program does not explicitly check if the supports in consecutive rows are placed in a manner that respects the `d` distance constraint between rows.
   - However, the problem description does not mention this constraint, so we assume it is not required.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k = 1` correctly by simply finding the minimum cost for a single row.
   - It also handles the case where `k > 1` by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where `k = n`, but this is not a significant issue since the logic for `k` consecutive rows would still apply.

Given the annotations and the analysis, the program seems to be correctly implementing the logic as per the problem description. The annotations confirm that the program is correctly updating the row costs and calculating the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows and there are no explicit contradictions with the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
