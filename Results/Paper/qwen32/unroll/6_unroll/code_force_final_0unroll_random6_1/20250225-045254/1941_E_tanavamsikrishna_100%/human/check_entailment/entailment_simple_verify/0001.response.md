### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue in `func_1` related to the unnecessary `while` loop that pops elements from the heap without using them. This loop can indeed lead to incorrect heap state and, consequently, incorrect results. Let's analyze this in more detail and verify if the program is correct based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `row[0] = 1`: The cost of placing a support at the first column is set to 1.
   - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: The cost of placing supports in the first `d` columns (except the first column) is incremented by 2.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: A list of tuples is created where each tuple contains the value and index of the first `d` elements of `row`.
   - `heapify(min_heap)`: This list is converted into a min-heap.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The loop `for i in range(d, len(row))` iterates over the remaining elements in `row` starting from the `d`-th element.
   - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass`: This loop pops elements from the heap as long as their index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. This loop is problematic because it pops elements from the heap without using them and does not re-push them, which can lead to an incorrect heap state.
   - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: The cost of placing a support at position `i` is updated based on the minimum cost from the heap.
   - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: The popped element is pushed back into the heap.
   - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: The updated cost at position `i` is pushed into the heap.

4. **Return Value**:
   - `return row[-1]`: The function returns the cost of placing supports in the last position of the row.

The problematic `while` loop can lead to incorrect heap state because it pops elements from the heap without using them and does not re-push them. This can cause the heap to lose important elements that might be needed later, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

#### Function `func_2()`:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the river grid.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
   - It calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the `while` loop in `func_1`. This loop can lead to incorrect heap state and, consequently, incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it stands.

**Final: **False**
