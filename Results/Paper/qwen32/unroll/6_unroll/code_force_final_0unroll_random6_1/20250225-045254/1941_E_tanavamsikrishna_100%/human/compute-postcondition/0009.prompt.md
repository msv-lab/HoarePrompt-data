You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 2.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: `row` is a list where elements at indices 1 to d-1 are each incremented by 2 compared to the initial `row`, and all other elements remain unchanged.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: `row` is a list where elements at indices 1 to d-1 are each incremented by 2 compared to the initial `row`, and elements from index d to the end are updated by adding the smallest values from the heap plus the current values of the elements in the `row` list plus 1. `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples reflecting these updated values.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the `row` list, which is updated by adding the smallest values from the heap plus the current values of the elements in the `row` list plus 1, starting from index `d` to the end.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers and an integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 2. It updates the elements of the `row` list starting from index `d` by adding the smallest values from a heap plus the current values of the elements in the `row` list plus 1, and returns the last element of the updated `row` list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the `row` list, which is updated by adding the smallest values from the heap plus the current values of the elements in the `row` list plus 1, starting from index `d` to the end.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
