To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the execution process step by step.

1. **Inputs and Initializations:**
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read as input.
   - `rows` is a 2D list where each sublist represents a row of `n` integers.
   - `costs` is a list of values computed by applying `func_1(row, d)` to each row in `rows`.
   - `total_costs` is a list of sums of every possible `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

2. **Understanding `func_1(row, d)`:**
   - The problem does not provide the definition of `func_1(row, d)`, so we will assume it computes some value based on the `row` and `d`. For the purpose of this explanation, let's denote the result of `func_1(row, d)` for a particular row as `cost`.

3. **Computing `costs`:**
   - For each row in `rows`, `func_1(row, d)` is called, and the result is stored in the `costs` list.
   - Therefore, `costs` is a list of `m` elements, where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to one of the `m` rows.

4. **Computing `total_costs`:**
   - `total_costs` is a list that contains the sums of every possible `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - This means `total_costs` will have `m - k + 1` elements because there are `m - k + 1` ways to pick `k` consecutive elements from a list of `m` elements.

5. **Finding the Minimum Value in `total_costs`:**
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will output the minimum value among all the sums in `total_costs`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and the behavior of `func_1(row, d)` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as the minimum sum of every possible `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every possible k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
