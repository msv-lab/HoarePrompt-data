The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t` before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
