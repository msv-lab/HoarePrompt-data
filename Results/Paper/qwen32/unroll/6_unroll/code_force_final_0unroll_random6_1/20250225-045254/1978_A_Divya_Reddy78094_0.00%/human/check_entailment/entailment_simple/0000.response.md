### Reasoning:
The problem requires Alice to divide her books into two non-empty piles and read the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages read.

The provided program follows a straightforward approach:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books, `n`, and their respective page counts.
3. It sorts the list of books in descending order based on the number of pages.
4. It then adds the number of pages of the two books with the highest page counts (i.e., `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`).

By sorting the books in descending order, the two largest values (the books with the most pages) are the first two elements of the sorted list. Adding these two values gives the maximum possible total number of pages Alice can read by choosing the highest page count book from each pile.

Since the problem guarantees that `n` is at least 2, there will always be at least two books to form two non-empty piles. Therefore, the approach is correct.
