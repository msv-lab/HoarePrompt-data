Reasoning: The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The core idea is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by selecting the two books with the highest number of pages, one from each pile. By sorting the list of books in descending order and summing the first two elements, the program ensures that it is selecting the two books with the highest number of pages. This is because the two largest books will always provide the maximum sum when divided into two separate piles.

The program handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of books and their respective page counts, sorts them, and outputs the sum of the two largest values.

Since the program correctly interprets the problem and provides the correct output for the given examples, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
