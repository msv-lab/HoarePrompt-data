Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to minimize the number of 5x3 screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 application icons and `y` number of 2x2 application icons. Each screen has a fixed size of 15 cells (5 rows x 3 columns).

### Program Analysis

Here is the provided program for reference:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `t = b * 2`.
   - It then adjusts this number to the nearest multiple of 5 (since each screen can fit a maximum of 5 of the 2x2 icons' areas). This is done using the formula:
     - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = t // 5`.
     - Otherwise, `t = t // 5 + 1`.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space**:
   - It calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
     - `t * 15` is the total number of cells used by `t` screens.
     - `b * 4` is the total number of cells occupied by `b` 2x2 icons.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means the remaining space is sufficient for all 1x1 icons, and no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2 = a - t1` is the number of 1x1 icons that still need placement.
     - It then calculates the number of additional screens needed for these 1x1 icons using a similar logic as before:
       - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program with a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
   - `t = 1 * 2 = 2`, `t = 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (since 2 % 5 != 0).
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, `t1 >= 1` is true.
   - Output: `1` (correct).

2. **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
   - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`, `t = 4 // 5 + 1 = 1` (since 4 % 5 != 0).
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`, `t1 >= 7` is false.
   - `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0`, no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1` (correct).

3. **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
   - `t = 4 * 2 = 8`, `t = 8 // 5 + 1 = 2` (since 8 % 5 != 0).
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 14`, `t1 >= 12` is false.
   - `t2 = 12 - 14 = -2` (this is incorrect, it should be `t2 = 12 - 14 + 15 = 13`).
   - `t = 2 + 13 // 15 + 1 = 3` (incorrect, it should be `t = 2 + 1 = 3`).
   - Output: `2` (correct).

The program seems to handle most cases correctly, but there are some edge cases where the logic might not be optimal or correct (e.g., when `t1` is less than `a` but the calculation for `t2` is not handled correctly).

### Conclusion

While the program seems to work for many test cases, there are potential issues with the logic, especially in the calculation of `t2` and the handling of edge cases.

**Correctness: False**

The program's logic needs refinement to correctly handle all edge cases and provide the minimal number of screens for all test cases.
