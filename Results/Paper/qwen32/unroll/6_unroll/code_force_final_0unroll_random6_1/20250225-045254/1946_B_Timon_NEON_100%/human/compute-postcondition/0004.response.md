The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop index, and it depends on the length of `arr`. The loop will execute if the length of `arr` is at least 1, because `range(len(arr))` will produce at least one index value (0) if `arr` is not empty.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `new_segment` is an empty list
- `max_segment` is [0, 0]
- `segments_variants` is an empty list
- `max_sum` is -1

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `arr` has at least one integer. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1**
