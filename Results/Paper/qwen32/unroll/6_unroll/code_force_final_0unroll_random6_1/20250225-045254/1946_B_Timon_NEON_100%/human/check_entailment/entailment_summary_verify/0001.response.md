### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to verify if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray (which can be empty) and inserting the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum contiguous subarray sum to the array. If the maximum contiguous subarray sum is non-positive, adding zeros (from an empty subarray) is better.
2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the sum can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number.
   ```python
   def func_1(number):
       return number % 1000000007
   ```
   This is correct.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is intended to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum and its indices. However, it has several issues:
   - It incorrectly handles the case when the maximum sum is non-positive.
   - It does not correctly update the `max_segment` when a new positive number is encountered.
   - It incorrectly handles the end of the array and does not correctly append the last segment to `segments_variants`.
   - It does not correctly determine the `total_max_segment` from `segments_variants`.

   Let's look at the function:
   ```python
   def func_2(arr):
       new_segment = []
       max_segment = [0, 0]
       segments_variants = []
       max_sum = -1
       for i in range(len(arr)):
           if new_segment:
               if arr[i] < 0:
                   if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                   else:
                       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                       max_segment = new_segment
                   new_segment = []
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
               else:
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                   new_segment[0] += arr[i]
           else:
               if arr[i] >= 0:
                   new_segment = [arr[i], i]
               max_segment[0] += arr[i]
       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       total_max_segment = [-1]
       for segment in segments_variants:
           if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
               total_max_segment = segment
       return total_max_segment
   ```
   This function is flawed in several ways:
   - It does not correctly handle the end of the array.
   - It incorrectly updates `max_segment` and `new_segment`.
   - It does not handle the case where all elements are non-positive.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is incomplete and does not implement the logic to perform the operations and compute the final sum.
   ```python
   def func_3(number, quantity):
       answer = 0
   ```
   This function is not implemented and does not perform any operations.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect. The function `func_2` has several logical errors, and `func_3` is incomplete. The original assessment correctly identifies these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
