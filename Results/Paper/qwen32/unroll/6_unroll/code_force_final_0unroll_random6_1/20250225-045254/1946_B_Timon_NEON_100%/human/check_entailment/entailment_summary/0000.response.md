### Reasoning:

The program consists of three functions, but only two of them are used in the main logic (`func_1` and `func_2`). Let's analyze each function and the main logic step-by-step to determine if the program meets the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is correct and matches the requirement to output the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given array and return it along with the end index of this subarray.
   - However, there are some issues with the current implementation:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the maximum sum subarray is entirely negative.
     - The `max_segment` and `new_segment` logic is flawed. Specifically, the `max_segment` should be updated correctly based on the Kadane's algorithm principles.
     - The `segments_variants` list is unnecessary and complicates the logic.
     - The function should return the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it fails to do so correctly when the array contains only negative numbers.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - It uses `func_2` to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then calculates the new sum as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - The result is then passed to `func_1` to get the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) result.

### Issues Identified:
- The implementation of `func_2` is incorrect for the problem at hand. It does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, especially when the array contains only negative numbers.
- The main logic relies on `func_2` to be correct, which it is not.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified with `func_2`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
