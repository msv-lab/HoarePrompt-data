Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incomplete Function 3**: The function `func_3` is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but it is not implemented. The current implementation only initializes `answer` to `0` and does nothing else.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Maximum Subarray**: The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum subarray sum, but its implementation is flawed. It does not correctly handle cases where the maximum subarray might be at the beginning or end of the list, and it does not handle negative numbers and zero correctly in all scenarios.

3. **Lack of Main Logic**: The main logic to determine the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is missing. The problem requires strategic decisions on which subarrays to add and where to insert them to maximize the sum.

4. **Modulo Operation**: While `func_1` correctly computes the modulo operation, it is not used in the rest of the program.

Here is a high-level outline of what the correct solution should do:

- Compute the maximum subarray sum using an algorithm like Kadane's algorithm.
- If the maximum subarray sum is positive, you can repeatedly add this subarray to maximize the sum.
- If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best strategy is to add zeros (by selecting empty subarrays) to avoid decreasing the sum.
- Use the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

A complete and correct implementation would need to address these points and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
