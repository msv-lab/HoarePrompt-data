### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine whether Sasha can guarantee that he can obtain any number of coins given the rules of the casino and his initial amount of coins. The key logic in the program is the calculation of the value `s`, which represents the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can achieve any number of coins, considering the maximum number of consecutive losses `x` and the multiplier `k`.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `s` is initialized to 1. This represents the minimum bet Sasha can make initially.

2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the maximum number of consecutive losses allowed.
   - In each iteration, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - `s // (k - 1)` represents the maximum bet Sasha can make in the previous state, given that he won the previous bet.
     - Adding 1 ensures that Sasha can still place a bet even if he lost the previous bet.

3. **Comparison**: After calculating `s`, the program checks if `a` (Sasha's initial amount of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`. If it is, Sasha can guarantee that he can achieve any number of coins; otherwise, he cannot.

This logic is based on the idea that Sasha needs to be able to recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses (`x`) and still be able to place bets to increase his coins.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **First Test Case (k=2, x=1, a=7)**:
   - `s` is calculated as follows:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
     - Since `a = 7` and `s = 3`, `a >= s` is true, so the output is "YES".

2. **Second Test Case (k=2, x=1, a=1)**:
   - `s` is calculated as follows:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
     - Since `a = 1` and `s = 3`, `a >= s` is false, so the output is "NO".

3. **Third Test Case (k=2, x=3, a=15)**:
   - `s` is calculated as follows:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
     - After 2 iterations: `s = 3 + 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7`
     - After 3 iterations: `s = 7 + 7 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 15`
     - Since `a = 15` and `s = 15`, `a >= s` is true, so the output is "YES".

The program correctly handles these test cases and the logic seems sound.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee that he can obtain any number of coins given the rules of the casino and his initial amount of coins.

**Correctness: True**
