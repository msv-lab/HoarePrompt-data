You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is a positive integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: a sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' for each of the t test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the given formula and prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Sasha's goal is to determine whether he can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any `n` by placing bets according to the casino rules. The key points are:
- He can win `y * k` coins if he bets `y` coins.
- He can lose `y` coins if he bets `y` coins.
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
- He starts with `a` coins.

Sasha needs a strategy that ensures he can always reach any number of coins `n`, regardless of the sequence of wins and losses, as long as he doesn't lose more than `x` times in a row.

### Strategy
To guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`, Sasha needs to be able to recover from losing `x` times in a row and still have enough coins to continue betting. Let's consider the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row.

If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, the amount of coins he loses can be calculated as follows:
- Let's say Sasha starts with `a` coins.
- In the worst case, he loses `x` times in a row, each time betting the maximum possible amount he can afford without going below zero.

The strategy involves calculating the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to survive the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and still be able to continue betting.

### Calculation
The calculation in the provided program seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of coins needed to survive the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row. The program calculates this by simulating the worst-case loss scenario and checking if the initial amount `a` is sufficient.

The loop `for i in range(x): s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is an attempt to simulate the worst-case loss scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row, each time betting the maximum possible amount he can afford. The variable `s` is initialized to 1 and is incremented in each iteration to simulate the worst-case loss scenario.

However, the provided program does not correctly simulate the worst-case scenario. The calculation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately represent the worst-case loss scenario. Instead, it seems to be an oversimplified and incorrect attempt to determine the minimum number of coins needed.

### Correctness of the Program
The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`. The calculation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately represent the worst-case loss scenario, and the program may produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
