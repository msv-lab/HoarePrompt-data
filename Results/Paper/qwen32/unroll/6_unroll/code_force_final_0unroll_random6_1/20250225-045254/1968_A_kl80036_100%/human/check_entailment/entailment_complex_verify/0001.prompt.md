You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the following t lines, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: For each of the initial t lines, the output will be the integer x from that line minus 1. The value of t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each of the following `t` lines, it reads an integer `x` and prints `x - 1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
You need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Key Observations:
1. The function \(\gcd(x, y)\) is maximized when \( y \) is the largest possible divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \).
2. If \( x \) is a prime number, the only divisors are 1 and \( x \) itself, so the best choice for \( y \) is 1.
3. For composite numbers, the largest divisor less than \( x \) is \( x - 1 \) if \( x - 1 \) divides \( x \). Otherwise, it's the next largest divisor.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program always sets \( y = x - 1 \) and prints it for each test case. Let's check if this approach always works:

- **For prime numbers**: If \( x \) is prime, then \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \). The expression \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).
- **For composite numbers**: If \( x \) is composite, \( x - 1 \) might not be a divisor of \( x \). However, choosing \( y = x - 1 \) is often a good candidate because:
  - If \( x - 1 \) is not a divisor of \( x \), the next largest divisor will be smaller, leading to a smaller \( \gcd(x, y) \).
  - If \( x - 1 \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, x-1) = x - 1 \), and the expression \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = (x-1) + (x-1) = 2(x-1) \), which is usually the maximum possible value.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 9 \). \(\gcd(10, 9) = 1\), \( 1 + 9 = 10 \).
2. For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 6 \). \(\gcd(7, 6) = 1\), \( 1 + 6 = 7 \).
3. For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 20 \). \(\gcd(21, 20) = 1\), \( 1 + 20 = 21 \).
4. For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 99 \). \(\gcd(100, 99) = 1\), \( 1 + 99 = 100 \).
5. For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \). \(\gcd(2, 1) = 1\), \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).
6. For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 999 \). \(\gcd(1000, 999) = 1\), \( 1 + 999 = 1000 \).
7. For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 5 \). \(\gcd(6, 5) = 1\), \( 1 + 5 = 6 \).

In all these cases, the program's output is correct because \( y = x - 1 \) leads to a maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program works correctly for the given problem constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
