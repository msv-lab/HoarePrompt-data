The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop `for i in range(2, n + 1):` will execute if `n` is at least 2 because the range starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1`. If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. The variables `t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n for each i, and `dp` is a list with two elements, both set to 1.**
