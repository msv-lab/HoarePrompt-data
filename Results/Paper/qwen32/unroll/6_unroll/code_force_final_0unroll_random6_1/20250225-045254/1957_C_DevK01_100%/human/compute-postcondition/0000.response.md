The given code snippet initializes a list `dp` with two elements, both set to 1. The initial state includes variables `t`, `n`, and `k` with specific constraints, and potentially a series of moves `r_i` and `c_i` for each test case. However, the code snippet provided does not interact with these variables; it only initializes `dp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `dp` is a list with two elements, both set to 1.**
