Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Definition Placement**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is called in the main loop, which will cause a `NameError` because Python does not allow calling a function before it is defined.

2. **Logic for Reducing `n`**: The logic for reducing `n` based on the moves is incorrect. After `k` moves, `n` should be reduced by the number of rows and columns that are occupied or blocked by the rooks. The current logic does not correctly handle the reduction of `n` when `a != b`.

3. **Final Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board, but it does not take into account the specific constraints and the mirrored nature of the moves. The function seems to be calculating something different from what is required.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation in `func_1` is `7 + 10 ** 9` instead of `10 ** 9 + 7`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    dp = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % MOD
    return dp[n]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    rows = set()
    cols = set()
    for _ in range(k):
        r, c = map(int, input().split())
        rows.add(r)
        cols.add(c)
        if r != c:
            rows.add(c)
            cols.add(r)
    free_rows = n - len(rows)
    free_cols = n - len(cols)
    free_cells = free_rows + free_cols - (free_rows == free_cols and free_rows > 0)
    print(func_1(free_cells))
```

This corrected version properly handles the reduction of `n` based on the occupied rows and columns and calculates the number of valid final configurations correctly.
