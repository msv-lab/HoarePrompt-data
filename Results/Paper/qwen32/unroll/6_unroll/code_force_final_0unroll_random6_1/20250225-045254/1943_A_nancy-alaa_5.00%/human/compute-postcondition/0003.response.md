Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`. It then determines and prints the smallest integer from 0 to `n-1` that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once, with the condition that if there are multiple such integers, the smallest one is chosen.**
