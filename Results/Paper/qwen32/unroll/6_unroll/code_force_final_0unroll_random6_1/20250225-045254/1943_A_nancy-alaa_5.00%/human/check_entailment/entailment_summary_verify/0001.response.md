### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a` and appending it to `c`, then deleting it from `a`.
- Bob then picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

#### Optimal Strategy:
- Alice will try to add the smallest available integers to `c` to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will try to block Alice by removing the smallest available integers from `a`.

#### Key Observations:
- The MEX of `c` is the smallest integer `i` that is either not present in `a` or appears exactly once in `a` (since Bob can only remove one instance of any integer per turn).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a` and then iterates over integers from `0` to `n-1` to determine the smallest integer that is either not present in `a` or appears exactly once.

Here's the logic in the code:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

- **Step 1**: Count the occurrences of each integer in `a` using `Counter`.
- **Step 2**: Iterate through integers from `0` to `n-1`.
  - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, print `i` (meaning `i` is not present in `a`).
  - If `i` appears exactly once in `a` and `first` is `True`, print `i` (meaning `i` is the first integer that appears exactly once after some integer not present in `a`).
  - If `i` appears exactly once, set `first` to `True`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The `first` flag is used incorrectly. It should track whether any integer has been added to `c` by Alice, but the program uses it to determine the MEX incorrectly.
- The logic `if mpp[i] == 1 and first:` is flawed. It should simply check for the first integer that appears exactly once without the need for the `first` flag.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach is to find the smallest integer `i` that is either not present in `a` or appears exactly once. This can be done by iterating through integers from `0` to `n-1` and checking the conditions directly.

Here's the corrected logic:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys() or mpp[i] == 1:
                print(i)
                break
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal strategy described above. The `first` flag is used incorrectly, leading to incorrect results. The provided program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
