Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the game's final score according to the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Let's analyze the correct approach to solving the problem:

1. **Understand the Game Dynamics:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and removing them, with Alice starting first.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - If there are enough distinct elements in `a`, Alice can ensure the MEX is higher by strategically choosing elements.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - Determine the smallest number `k` such that the first `k` non-negative integers are present in `a` with at least one occurrence each.
   - If `k` is even, Bob can force the MEX to be `k` because he can always prevent Alice from completing the set of the first `k+1` integers.
   - If `k` is odd, Alice can force the MEX to be `k+1` because she can ensure that the first `k+1` integers are present in `c` by the end of the game.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - Find the smallest `k` such that the first `k` non-negative integers are all present in `a`.
   - Determine the MEX based on the parity of `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        k = 0
        while k in mpp:
            k += 1
        if k % 2 == 0:
            print(k)
        else:
            print(k + 1)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
