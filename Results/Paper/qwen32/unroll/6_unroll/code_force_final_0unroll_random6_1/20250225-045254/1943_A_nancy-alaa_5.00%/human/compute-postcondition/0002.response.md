Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the provided constraints.**
