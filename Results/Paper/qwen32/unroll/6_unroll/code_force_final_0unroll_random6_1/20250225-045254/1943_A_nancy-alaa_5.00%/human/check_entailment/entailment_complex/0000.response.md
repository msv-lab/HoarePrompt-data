### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed according to the rules of the game. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

Here's a breakdown of the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob:
- **Alice** wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to include as many lower integers as possible in `c`.
- **Bob** wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to prevent Alice from including lower integers in `c`.

Let's analyze the provided code:
- The code reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` using `Counter`.
- It then iterates from `0` to `n-1` and checks:
  - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` does not appear in `a`, so it prints `i` and breaks.
  - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks.
  - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it sets `first` to `True`.

The logic here seems to be flawed for determining the MEX optimally. The strategy described does not account for the alternating turns of Alice and Bob and does not simulate the game process to determine the final state of `c`.

Let's consider the correct approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: Count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
2. **Simulate Turns**: Simulate the turns of Alice and Bob:
   - Alice will pick the smallest available integer that maximizes the MEX.
   - Bob will pick the smallest available integer that minimizes the MEX.
3. **Determine MEX**: After all turns, determine the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

The provided code does not simulate the turns and does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem.
