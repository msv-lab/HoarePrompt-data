### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the program's logic.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending to `c` (Alice) or just removing from `a` (Bob).
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Since Alice and Bob play optimally, the game's final MEX is determined by the elements' frequencies in `a`.
   - The MEX of `c` can be determined by the smallest integer that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once, as Alice can ensure that such a number is added to `c` if possible.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through integers from 0 to `n-1` and checks:
     - If an integer `i` is not in the `Counter` (i.e., it does not appear in `a`), it prints `i` and breaks.
     - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a` and it is the first such integer found (`first` flag is `True`), it prints `i` and breaks.
     - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it sets the `first` flag to `True`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once, which aligns with the optimal strategy for Alice.
   - The `first` flag ensures that if there are multiple integers that appear exactly once, the smallest one is chosen.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
