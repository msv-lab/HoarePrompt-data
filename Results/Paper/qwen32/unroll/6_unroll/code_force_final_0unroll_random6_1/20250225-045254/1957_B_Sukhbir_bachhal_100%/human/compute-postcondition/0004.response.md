The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `n` is described as an integer where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `n` is not equal to 0. Since `n` is already guaranteed to be not equal to 0 within the specified range, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further.

State: **The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. The function will be called multiple times (up to `t` times, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`), each with its own pair of `n` and `k` values. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases will not exceed `2 * 10^5`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0. `position` is 0.**
