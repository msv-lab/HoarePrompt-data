You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the number of integers in the list, the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and the list of integers given to Anna, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Anna reverses the digits of one number in her turn.
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers in his turn.
   - The game ends when only one number remains in the list.
   - Sasha wins if this number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

2. **Winning Strategy:**
   - Anna aims to minimize the final number by reversing digits.
   - Sasha aims to maximize the final number by concatenating strategically.
   - The key to winning is the total number of digits in the final number and the impact of leading zeros removed by Anna's moves.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) (number of integers) and \(m\) (minimum number of digits for Sasha to win).
   - It then reads the list of integers.

2. **Logic of the Program:**
   - **Total Digits Calculation:**
     - The program calculates the total number of digits in all numbers.
   - **Leading Zeros Calculation:**
     - For each number, it calculates the number of leading zeros if the number were reversed (using `func_1`).
     - It stores these counts in the `zeros` list.
   - **Sorting and Summing Leading Zeros:**
     - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.
     - Every second element (starting from the first) is summed up (`subtract_zero`), which likely represents the leading zeros that are effectively removed after optimal play.
   - **Decision Making:**
     - The program checks if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the leading zeros is at least \(m + 1\).
     - If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program assumes that the optimal strategy for Anna is to remove leading zeros, but this may not always be the case.
   - The program does not account for the strategic placement of digits by Sasha, which can significantly affect the final number.
   - The program does not simulate the game to determine the exact final number, which is necessary for an optimal strategy.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program may not handle cases where the final number is exactly \(10^m\) correctly.
   - The program does not consider scenarios where Anna might want to reverse digits to avoid certain concatenations by Sasha.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies for both players. It simplifies the problem by focusing only on leading zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.
