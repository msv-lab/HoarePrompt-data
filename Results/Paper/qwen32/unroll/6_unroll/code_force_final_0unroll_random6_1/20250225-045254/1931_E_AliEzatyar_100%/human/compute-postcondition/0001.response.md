To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in the provided for loop is:

```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
```

The variables involved in the loop head are:
- `i`: the loop variable
- `len(num) - 1`: the starting point of the range
- `-1`: the stopping point of the range (exclusive)
- `-1`: the step of the range

The loop will execute if the range function produces at least one value. This will happen if the starting point is greater than or equal to the stopping point.

Given the starting point is `len(num) - 1` and the stopping point is `-1`, the loop will execute if `len(num) - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`. This simplifies to `len(num)` being greater than `0`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num` must be a list with at least one test case. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the range function.

The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `num` has at least one test case. The `counter` variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`num` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `counter` is 0**
