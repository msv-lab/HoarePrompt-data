The provided code snippet initializes a variable `counter` to 0. This operation does not affect any other variables or data structures mentioned in the initial state. The initial state specifies the structure of the `num` variable, which contains test cases, but this variable is not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`; `counter` is 0.**
