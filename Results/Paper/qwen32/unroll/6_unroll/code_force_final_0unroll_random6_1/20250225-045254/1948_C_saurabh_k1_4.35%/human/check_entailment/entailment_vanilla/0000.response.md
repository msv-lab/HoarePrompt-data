Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and has two actions each second:
1. Move one cell in one of four possible directions (left, right, down, up).
2. Move according to the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on.

The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n).

### Key Observations
- The robot can only move right or left in the same row or move down or up between rows.
- The robot starts on the top row (row 1).
- The robot needs to reach the bottom row (row 2) at the last column (column n).

### Correctness Analysis of the Provided Program
The provided program checks only the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the bottom row (i.e., `b[n - 2]`). If this arrow points left (`<`), it prints "No", indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. Here's why:
- The robot needs to be able to navigate through the grid correctly, considering all the arrows in both rows.
- The program does not take into account the arrows in the top row (`a`) and how they influence the robot's movement.
- The program does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid to see if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

### Example Counter-Case
Consider the following test case:
```
2
4
>>><
>><<
```
The program would incorrectly output "No" for this test case because `b[2]` (third cell of the second row) is `<`. However, the robot can actually reach the target cell (2, 4) by following the path: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and does not consider all possible paths and arrows in the grid. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
