Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= k <= m <= n`. It also accepts two lists: `a` which contains `n` integers and `b` which contains `m` integers. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
