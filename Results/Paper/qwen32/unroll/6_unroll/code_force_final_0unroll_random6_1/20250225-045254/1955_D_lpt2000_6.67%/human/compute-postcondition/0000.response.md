The code snippet `nabors = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. The initial state mentions `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `nabors` with the value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Similarly, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `nabors` is an integer provided by the input.**
