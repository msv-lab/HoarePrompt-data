To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given the constraints and rules of the game.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective:** Maximize your score by selecting cards optimally.
2. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player receives `n` cards.
   - Players take turns placing cards on the table.
   - A player scores a point if the number on the card is already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
3. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the number of cards `n` you receive.
   - The list of `n` integers representing the numbers on your cards.
4. **Output:**
   - The maximum number of points you can score for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

Let's break down what this program does:
1. It reads input from standard input.
2. It processes every second line starting from the third line (index 2), which corresponds to the list of integers on your cards for each test case.
3. For each test case, it calculates the difference between the total number of cards (`len(tokens)`) and the number of unique cards (`len({*tokens})`).
4. It prints this difference.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Logic:** The program calculates the number of duplicate cards in your hand (`len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`). This is the maximum number of points you can score because each duplicate card can potentially score a point if you play optimally.
- **Optimal Play:** The program assumes that you will always play optimally to maximize your score, which is to play your duplicate cards when possible. This is a correct assumption because playing a duplicate card will always score a point if it's the second occurrence of that number.
- **Nene's Strategy:** The program does not explicitly model Nene's strategy but relies on the fact that Nene's optimal play does not affect the calculation of your maximum possible score based on your hand.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
