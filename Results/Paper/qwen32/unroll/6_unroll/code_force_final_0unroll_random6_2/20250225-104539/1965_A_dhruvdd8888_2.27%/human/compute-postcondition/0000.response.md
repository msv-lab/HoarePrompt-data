Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The function `func_1` takes no arguments but operates on input provided through standard input. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
