### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:

The provided program is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key points. However, the annotations do not provide insight into the correctness of the logic used within the loops and conditions.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Loop and Calculation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\). This loop variable \(i\) is not clearly related to \(a\) or \(b\) in a way that helps find valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The calculation `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not seem to correctly determine the valid pairs.

2. **Condition Checks**:
   - The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is incorrect and does not serve the intended purpose. The second part of the condition `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is always true for \(i > 1\), which does not make sense in the context of the problem.

3. **Output Adjustment**:
   - The subtraction of `2` from `suma` at the end is arbitrary and does not logically follow from the program's logic.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done using nested loops, but given the constraints, an optimized approach is necessary to avoid TLE (Time Limit Exceeded).

#### Correctness of the Given Program:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement. The logic and calculations within the loop are incorrect and do not lead to the right solution.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program is indeed incorrect.

### Final:
Final: **False**
