Functionality: **The function reads two integers `x` and `y` as strings, then modifies them such that for the first half of their lengths, each digit in the first integer becomes the maximum of the corresponding digits from the original integers, and each digit in the second integer becomes the minimum. For the second half, the opposite occurs. It then prints the modified integers.**
