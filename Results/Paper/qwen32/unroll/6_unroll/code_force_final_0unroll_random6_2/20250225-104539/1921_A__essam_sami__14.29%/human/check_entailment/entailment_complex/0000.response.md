### Reasoning:

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of a square. The program then calculates the squared distances between two pairs of opposite corners of the square. The area of the square can be determined by taking the square root of the larger of these two squared distances, but since the area of a square is the side length squared, the program directly prints the larger squared distance.

However, the program actually prints the smaller of the two squared distances, which is incorrect. This is because the smaller squared distance will not give the correct area of the square. The correct approach would be to calculate the squared distances between all pairs of points and then find the maximum one, which would represent the squared length of the diagonal of the square. The area of the square is then the side length squared, which can be calculated from the diagonal length using the Pythagorean theorem.

In this case, the given program does not correctly determine the area of the square. It prints the smaller squared distance instead of the larger one, which is not the correct approach.

### Correctness: **False**
