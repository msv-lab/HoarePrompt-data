Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts with a minimum cost. The cost of a cyclic shift is defined as the length of the substring being shifted.

### Code Analysis
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function seems to be processing a single test case. It reads a binary string, counts the number of '1's, and calculates a cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` reads the input using `input().split()`, which expects space-separated values. However, the problem statement specifies that the input is a binary string without spaces. This will cause an error when the input is read.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic within `func_1()` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The current logic simply counts the number of '1's and calculates a cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's, which does not account for the actual cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue
Consider the test case:
```
1
101011
```
The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, as described in the problem statement. However, the provided code will not produce this result. Instead, it will likely produce an incorrect cost due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
