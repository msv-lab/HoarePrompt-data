### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads a list of integers (which are supposed to be 0s and 1s) from the input.
   - It counts the number of 1s encountered (`n`).
   - It calculates an accumulated cost (`ans`) based on the number of 1s and the positions of 0s in the list. Specifically, for each 0 encountered after at least one 1 has been seen, it adds `n + 1` to the cost.
   - It prints the accumulated cost.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` exactly `t` times.

### Critical Analysis:

The key point is to verify whether the logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string as per the problem statement.

- The problem requires cyclic shifts on substrings to sort the string. The cost is the length of the substring being shifted.
- The provided `func_1` does not actually perform any cyclic shifts. Instead, it calculates a cost based on the count of 1s and the positions of 0s, which does not align with the problem's requirements.
- The approach in `func_1` seems to be based on a different problem or a misunderstanding of the problem. For example, it does not consider the actual cyclic shifting operations and their costs.

### Conclusion:

Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the logic implemented in `func_1`, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
