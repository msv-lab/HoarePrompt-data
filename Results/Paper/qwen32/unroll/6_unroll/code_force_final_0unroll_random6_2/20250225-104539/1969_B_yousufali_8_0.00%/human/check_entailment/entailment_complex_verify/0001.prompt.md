You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string. n is an integer initialized to 0, used to count the number of 1s encountered in the list. ans is an integer initialized to 0, used to accumulate the total cost.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string; n is the total number of 1s encountered in the list; ans is the accumulated cost calculated as explained.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the accumulated cost calculated based on the number of 1s in the list s and other unspecified factors)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a list of integers (each being either 0 or 1) from the input, counts the number of 1s encountered, and calculates an accumulated cost based on the number of 1s and the positions of 0s in the list. It then prints this accumulated cost.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prompts the user to input an integer `t` and then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves cyclically shifting substrings of a binary string to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s). The goal is to find the minimum total cost of these operations, where the cost of shifting a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations:
1. The optimal strategy involves moving all 1s to the end of the string. This can be achieved by repeatedly moving the first 1 encountered after a 0 to the end of the substring starting from the first 1.
2. The cost to move a 1 that is preceded by `n` zeros is `n + 1` because we need to cyclically shift the substring that includes the 1 and all preceding zeros.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string, counts the number of 1s encountered (`n`), and calculates the cost to move each 1 to the end of the string.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1()`.

#### Issues with `func_1()`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function `func_1()` reads the input as a list of integers using `input().split()`. However, the problem specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. This will cause incorrect parsing.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is correct given the correct input parsing. It correctly calculates the cost to move each 1 to the end of the string.

### Corrected Input Reading:
To fix the input reading issue, we need to read the binary string as a string and then convert each character to an integer.

### Correct Program:
Here is the corrected version of `func_1()`:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':  # Check if the character is '1'
            n += 1
        elif n != 0:  # If the character is '0' and there are preceding '1's
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect input parsing in `func_1()`. The logic for calculating the cost is correct, but the input should be read as a string and then processed accordingly.

Correctness: **False**
