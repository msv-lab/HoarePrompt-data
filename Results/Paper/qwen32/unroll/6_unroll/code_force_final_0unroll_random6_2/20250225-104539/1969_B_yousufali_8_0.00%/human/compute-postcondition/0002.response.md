To determine the output state after the given loop has executed, let's analyze the loop and its components.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an input integer.
- In each iteration, the function `func_1()` is called.

Given that the loop does not modify the variable `t` or any other variable outside its scope, the only effect of the loop is to execute `func_1()` `t` times. Since the problem does not specify what `func_1()` does, we can only conclude that it will be called `t` times.

Therefore, the output state will only reflect the fact that `func_1()` has been called `t` times, and no other variables will change from their initial state.

Output State: **`func_1()` has been called `t` times.**
