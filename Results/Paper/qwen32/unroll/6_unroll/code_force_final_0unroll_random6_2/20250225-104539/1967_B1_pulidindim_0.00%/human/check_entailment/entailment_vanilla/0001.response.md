Let's analyze the given problem and the corresponding program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
2. \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program and see if it correctly addresses the problem.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans = n`: This initializes the answer with `n`, which is the number of pairs where `b=1`. For `b=1`, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) simplifies to \(a + 1\) being a multiple of 1, which is always true for any `a`. Hence, there are `n` such pairs.

2. **Loop for `b > 1`**:
   - The loop starts with `count = 2` and goes up to `m`.
   - For each `count` (which represents `b`), it calculates `countmins = count - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g = n / count`.
   - If `g < countmins`, it breaks the loop. This condition seems to be checking if the number of valid `a` values is less than the number of previous `b` values, which doesn't directly relate to the problem's conditions.
   - It then adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins`.
   - Finally, it increments `ans` by `g / count + 1` and increments `count`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for counting valid pairs for `b > 1` seems incorrect. The formula `g = n / count` and subsequent adjustments do not directly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as per the problem's conditions.
- The program does not correctly implement the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as per the problem's conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
