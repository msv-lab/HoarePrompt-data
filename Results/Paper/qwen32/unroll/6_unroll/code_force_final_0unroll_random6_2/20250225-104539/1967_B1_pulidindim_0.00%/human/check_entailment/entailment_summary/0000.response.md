Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem, but let's break down its logic and see if it matches the requirements:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`.
3. It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
4. It enters a loop that continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
5. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n / count`.
6. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
7. Otherwise, it adjusts `g` and adds a calculated value to `ans`.
8. Finally, it prints `ans` as an integer.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `ans = 0` since we are counting pairs, not starting with `n`.
2. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic does not correctly implement the condition that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The calculations inside the loop do not seem to reflect this condition.
3. **GCD Calculation**: The program does not compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` anywhere, which is crucial for the condition check.
4. **Counting Logic**: The program's logic for counting valid pairs based on `count` and `g` does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to compute the gcd and does not accurately count the valid pairs based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
