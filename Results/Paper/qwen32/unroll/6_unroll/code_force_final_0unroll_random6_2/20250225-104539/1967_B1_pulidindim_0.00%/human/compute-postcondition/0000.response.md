Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input. The preconditions about the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain valid and unchanged.
