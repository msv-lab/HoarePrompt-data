You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the final value of `ans` after processing the corresponding pair of `n` and `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on a specific algorithm involving `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description. The logic in the program seems to be incorrect and does not handle all cases properly.

Let's analyze the problem and the program in more detail:

### Problem Analysis:
The conditions to be satisfied by pairs \((a, b)\) are:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs but uses a flawed approach:
- It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
- It then iterates over possible values of `count` up to `m`.
- For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n / count`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks the loop.
- Otherwise, it adjusts `g` and adds a calculated value to `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop logic does not correctly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions. It seems to be trying to optimize the calculation but does not handle all cases correctly.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation of `ans` using `g` and `count` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The program does not properly iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` to check the conditions.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` or `m` is 1.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
The valid pairs \((a, b)\) are:
1. \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
2. \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
3. \((3, 1)\): \(3 + 1 = 4\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\).
4. \((3, 3)\): \(3 + 3 = 6\) which is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 3\).

The program will not correctly calculate this and will likely produce an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is:
Correctness: **False**.
