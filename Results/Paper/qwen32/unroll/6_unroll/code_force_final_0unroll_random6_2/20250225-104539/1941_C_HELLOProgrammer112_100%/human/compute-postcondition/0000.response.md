In the provided for loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is expected to be the number of test cases, `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, `int(input())` should return a value within this range to ensure the loop executes.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution condition, we do not need to adjust its state.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value within the valid range for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `int(input())` returns `t`**
