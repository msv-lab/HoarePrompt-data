Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then subtracts the occurrences of the overlapping substring "mapie". However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. 

The issue is that the program does not account for the fact that removing a single character can potentially eliminate multiple occurrences of "map" or "pie" if they overlap. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where removing one character affects the count of other "map" or "pie" substrings in complex ways.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, is needed to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated accurately.
