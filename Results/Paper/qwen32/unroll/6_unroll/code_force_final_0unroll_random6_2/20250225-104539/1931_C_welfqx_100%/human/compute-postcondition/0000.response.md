Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet and retain their preconditions.
