Correctness: **False**

The given program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and example outputs.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Indentation and Logic Placement**:
   - The `if-else` block that determines the winner is incorrectly placed outside the loop. This means it will only execute after all test cases have been read, which is not the intended behavior. It should be inside the loop to handle each test case individually.

2. **Incorrect Winner Determination Logic**:
   - The program uses the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` to determine the winner, which is not the correct logic for this problem.
   - The correct logic should be based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd or even, but the interpretation of the result needs to be adjusted. If the sum `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints `'bob  '` and `'alice'` with an extra space after `'bob'`. The output should be exactly `'Bob'` and `'Alice'` without any extra spaces.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Loop Through Each Test Case**: The loop runs for each test case, and the winner is determined for each case individually.
- **Correct Winner Determination**: The sum of the coins `(a + b)` is checked. If it is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.
- **Correct Output Formatting**: The output is exactly `'Bob'` or `'Alice'` without any extra spaces, matching the required format.
