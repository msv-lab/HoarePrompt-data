Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The logic in the code is incorrect because it only checks if the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is even or odd and then prints "bob" or "alice" respectively. However, this does not align with the optimal play strategy described in the problem.

Let's analyze the problem and the correct approach:

1. If `a == b`, Alice and Bob will always end up in a situation where both have 0 coins after an equal number of turns. Since Alice makes the first move, Bob will be the one who cannot make a move and will lose.
2. If `a != b`, the player with more coins can always force the other player into a losing position by ensuring that the other player is left with an equal number of coins in their turn. The player with more coins can always swap wallets to make the number of coins equal or more in their favor, ensuring they can always make a move until the opponent cannot.

The correct solution should be based on this logic:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a != b`, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

The provided code does not implement this logic and thus does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, for the input `1 4`, the provided code will incorrectly output "bob" instead of "Alice".
