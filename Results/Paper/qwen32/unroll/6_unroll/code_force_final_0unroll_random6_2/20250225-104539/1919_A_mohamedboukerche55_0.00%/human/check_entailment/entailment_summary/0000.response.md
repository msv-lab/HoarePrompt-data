Reasoning:
The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by checking the parity (odd or even) of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, it concludes that Bob will win, and if the sum is odd, it concludes that Alice will win.

However, this approach is incorrect. The game's outcome is not solely determined by the parity of the sum of the coins. The optimal strategy involves more than just the total number of coins; it depends on the individual counts of coins in each player's wallet and how they can be manipulated through the allowed moves.

The key insight to solve this problem is to consider the game as a Nim game with two piles, where each player can either remove a coin from a pile or swap the piles. The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of the pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move; otherwise, it is winning.

The correct approach involves calculating the XOR of `a` and `b`. If `a ^ b == 0`, Bob wins because Alice starts in a losing position. If `a ^ b != 0`, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

Given that the provided code does not implement this logic, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
