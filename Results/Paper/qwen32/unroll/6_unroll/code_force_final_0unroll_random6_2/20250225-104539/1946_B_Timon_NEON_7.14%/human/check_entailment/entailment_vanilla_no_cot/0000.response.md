Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`:** It correctly computes the modulo of a number with \(10^9 + 7\), but it is not used in the program.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function seems to be intended to find the maximum sum subarray and its indices, but it has several issues:
   - The logic for handling negative numbers and updating `max_segment` is flawed.
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array contains all negative numbers.
   - The function does not return the correct maximum sum subarray in all cases.

3. **Function `func_3`:** This function is not implemented at all. It is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, but it is currently just a placeholder with no logic.

The core issue with the logic is that the program does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations. The optimal strategy involves using the maximum subarray sum repeatedly, but the implementation does not correctly handle this.

To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Compute the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
- Use this maximum subarray sum to compute the final maximum possible sum after `k` operations, taking into account the modulo operation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

def max_possible_sum(arr, k):
    max_sum = max_subarray_sum(arr)
    if max_sum <= 0:
        return sum(x for x in arr if x > 0) % MOD
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    if total_sum > 0:
        return (total_sum + max_sum * k) % MOD
    else:
        return (total_sum + max_sum * (k - 1)) % MOD

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input[index:index+2])
        index += 2
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(max_possible_sum(arr, k))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly computes the maximum possible sum after `k` operations using the maximum subarray sum and handles the modulo operation.
