You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function takes a list of integers and a non-negative integer as input. It returns a sublist containing the first `quantity` elements from the list. If `quantity` exceeds the length of the list, the entire list is returned.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The code is incomplete and does not perform the required operations to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

Here are the issues with the provided code:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The code does not perform any operations to insert the sum of any subarray into the array. It only seems to identify the maximum subarray sum, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Operations**: The code does not handle the k operations as described in the problem. It does not repeatedly insert the sum of a subarray into the array to maximize the total sum.

3. **Lack of Modulo Operation**: While the code includes a function `func_1` to take a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), it does not use this function anywhere in the code to ensure that the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Incomplete Functionality**: The function `func_3` is defined but not implemented, and it does not seem to be used in the code.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
- Compute the maximum subarray sum using an algorithm like Kadane's.
- Repeatedly insert the maximum subarray sum back into the array to maximize the total sum.
- Ensure that all operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is a sketch of what the correct implementation might look like:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in arr:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

def max_sum_after_operations(arr, k):
    max_sum = max_subarray_sum(arr)
    current_sum = sum(x for x in arr if x > 0)
    for _ in range(k):
        current_sum = (current_sum + max_sum) % MOD
        max_sum = (max_sum + max_sum) % MOD
    return current_sum

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = max_sum_after_operations(arr, k)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation correctly handles the problem by identifying the maximum subarray sum, performing k operations to maximize the total sum, and ensuring all operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
