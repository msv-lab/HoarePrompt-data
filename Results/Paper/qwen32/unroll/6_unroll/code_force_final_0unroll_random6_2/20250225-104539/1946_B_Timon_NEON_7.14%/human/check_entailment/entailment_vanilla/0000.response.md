Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting that sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   ```python
   def func_1(number):
       return number % 1000000007
   ```
   This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   ```python
   def func_2(arr):
       new_segment = []
       max_segment = [0, 0]
       segments_variants = []
       max_sum = -1
       for i in range(len(arr)):
           if new_segment:
               if arr[i] < 0:
                   if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                   else:
                       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                       max_segment = new_segment
                   new_segment = []
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
               else:
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                   new_segment[0] += arr[i]
           else:
               if arr[i] >= 0:
                   new_segment = [arr[i], i]
               max_segment[0] += arr[i]
       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       total_max_segment = [-1]
       for segment in segments_variants:
           if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
               total_max_segment = segment
       if len(total_max_segment) == 1:
           total_max_segment = [-1]
       return total_max_segment
   ```
   This function appears to be trying to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum, but the logic is flawed:
   - It initializes `max_segment` with `[0, 0]`, which is incorrect because the maximum sum of a subarray can be negative.
   - It incorrectly updates `max_segment` and `new_segment`.
   - It does not correctly handle the case where all elements are negative.
   - The function is supposed to return the maximum sum subarray, but it seems to be appending wrong segments to `segments_variants`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   ```python
   def func_3(number, quantity):
       answer = 0
   ```
   This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations. It should compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, and `func_3` is incomplete. The program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
