To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the `segments_variants` list, which is the iterable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `segments_variants` contains at least one element. 

Let's break down the given state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `new_segment` is an empty list.
- `max_segment` is [sum of the last segment, end index of the last segment].
- `segments_variants` is a list of all considered segments, which includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.

For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must have at least one element. Given the description, `segments_variants` should include `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `[len(arr) - 1]`. However, to guarantee that the loop executes, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` is not empty.

Let's assume `arr` has at least one element, so `len(arr) - 1` is a valid index. We need to ensure that `max_segment` is properly defined. Since `max_segment` includes the sum of the last segment and the end index of the last segment, we need to ensure that `max_segment` is a valid list with two elements.

Let's define `max_segment` as `[0, 0]` initially, which means the sum of the last segment is 0 and the end index of the last segment is 0. This will ensure that `segments_variants` has at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is `[[0, 0, len(arr) - 1], [len(arr) - 1]]`, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`**
