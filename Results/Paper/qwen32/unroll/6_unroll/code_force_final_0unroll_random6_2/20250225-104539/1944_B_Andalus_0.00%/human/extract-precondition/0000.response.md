Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n / 2⌋. a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 ⋅ 10^4.**
