### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by first sorting the two halves of the input array, then identifying pairs of identical elements in each half and single elements in the first half. The program then attempts to build the arrays `l` and `r` by adding pairs of identical elements and single elements to each array until they reach the required size of `2k`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Single Elements**: The program adds single elements from the first half (`lft`) to both `l` and `r`. This is incorrect because single elements should only be added to one of the arrays, not both.
2. **No Handling of Remaining Elements**: The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`. It simply adds pairs and single elements without considering their XOR values.
3. **No Consideration for XOR Requirement**: The program does not check if the XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the elements in `r`. It only ensures that both arrays have `2k` elements.

To fix these issues, the program would need to carefully select elements from both halves to ensure that their XOR values are equal. A correct approach might involve using a greedy strategy to balance the XOR values between the two arrays.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
