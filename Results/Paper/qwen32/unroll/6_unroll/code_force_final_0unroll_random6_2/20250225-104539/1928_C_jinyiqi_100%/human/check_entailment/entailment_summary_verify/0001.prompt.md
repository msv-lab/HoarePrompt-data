You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, sorted such that the larger divisors come first, followed by the smaller divisors in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves finding the number of valid `k` values for which a given position `n` in the line corresponds to a given number `x` in a "settling" pattern. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to `k`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (position) and `x` (number received).

2. **Logic for Finding `k`:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find divisors of the respective expression.
   - It then checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s` found by `func_1`.
   - If both conditions are met, it adds `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.

3. **Removing Duplicates and Output:**
   - The program uses `set` to remove duplicates from the `output` list.
   - It prints the length of the `output` list, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

4. **`func_1` Function:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns the divisors in a specific order, but the order does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness Check

The program's logic seems to be based on the mathematical properties of the problem. However, there are a few issues:

- **Condition for `k`:** The problem specifies that `k > 1`. The program correctly handles this by ensuring `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` and implicitly checking for `k > 1` through the conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
  
- **Divisor Calculation:** The `func_1` function correctly calculates all divisors of a number, which is necessary for finding potential `k` values.

- **Handling Edge Cases:** The program correctly handles the constraints `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

### Issues in the Program

- **Floating Point Division:** The program uses `/` for division, which results in a floating-point number. Since `k` must be an integer, the program should use `//` for integer division.
  
- **Redundant Checks:** The program checks `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` after already checking `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`. This redundancy can be removed.

### Conclusion

Despite the minor issues, the core logic of the program is correct. However, the use of floating-point division can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues. To ensure correctness, integer division should be used.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False** (due to the use of floating-point division)

However, if the floating-point division issue is corrected, the program would be correct.

Correctness: **True** (after correcting the division issue)
