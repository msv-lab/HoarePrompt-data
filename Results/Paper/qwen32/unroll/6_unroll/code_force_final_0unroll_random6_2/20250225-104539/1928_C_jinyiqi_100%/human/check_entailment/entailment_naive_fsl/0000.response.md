Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to be using a helper function `func_1` that finds the divisors of a number, but the logic to determine the valid `k` values is not correctly implemented based on the problem description. The program does not correctly handle the conditions to determine the valid `k` values for all possible inputs.

Let's analyze the problem and the code in detail:

### Problem Analysis:
1. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. For a given position `n` and number `x`, we need to find all possible `k` such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the settling pattern.

### Key Points:
1. For a given `k`, the pattern is: `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2`.
2. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
3. To find the number at a specific position `n`, we need to determine the position within the repeating segment and check if it matches `x`.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. The function `func_1` finds divisors of a number, but it is not clear how these divisors are used to find valid `k` values.
2. The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are not directly related to finding valid `k` values.
3. The logic to check if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` and if it is greater than or equal to `x` is not correct.

### Correct Approach:
1. For each possible `k` starting from `x` to `n`, check if the number `x` appears at position `n` in the settling pattern.
2. The position `n` within the repeating segment can be found using `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2)`.
3. Check if the number at this position in the pattern is `x`.

### Example of a Correct Implementation:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for k in range(x, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k:
            if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 1 - (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == x:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values for the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.
