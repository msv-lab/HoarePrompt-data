Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine the number of possible values of `k` that fit the described conditions. The logic involves calculating potential `k` values based on the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received.

The function `func_1` computes all divisors of a given number `x`. The main logic of the program is based on the observations that `k` can be derived from the expressions `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`. Specifically, for each divisor `s` of these expressions, if `(s + 2) / 2` is a natural number greater than or equal to `x`, it is considered a valid `k`.

However, there are a few issues in the implementation:
1. The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` checks if `(s + 2)` is even, which is correct. But the subsequent division `(s + 2) / 2` should be an integer division `(s + 2) // 2` to avoid floating-point results.
2. The logic for checking the divisors seems correct, but the program does not handle the case where `n - x` is less than 0, which should not happen as per the problem constraints (`x < n`), but it is good practice to ensure such conditions are handled properly.
3. The use of `set` to remove duplicates is correct, as different divisors might lead to the same `k` value.

Despite these minor issues, the overall logic and the provided execution summary suggest that the program is intended to work correctly. However, the correctness is dependent on the assumption that `n - x` is always non-negative and that the division should be integer division.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program appears to be aiming for the correct solution, but due to the floating-point division, it may not always produce the correct integer results for `k`.

Correctness: **False**
