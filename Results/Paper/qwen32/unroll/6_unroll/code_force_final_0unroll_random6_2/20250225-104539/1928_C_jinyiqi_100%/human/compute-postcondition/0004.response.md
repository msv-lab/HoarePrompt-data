The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The other variables (`x`, `n`, and `output2`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < n â‰¤ 10^9; `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order; `output2` is a list of the corresponding quotient divisors of `x`.**
