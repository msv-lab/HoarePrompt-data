You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of nodes `n`, the number of edges `m`, and an integer `k`. For each test case, it also processes `m` lines of input, each representing an edge between two nodes with a feature value. The function calculates and prints a specific value `s` for each test case, which is derived from the provided inputs and is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all chosen pairs for k excursions. This expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Key Points**:
   - There are \(n\) children and \(m\) pairs of friends.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value.
   - For each of the \(k\) excursions, a pair is chosen randomly.
   - If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The friendship value of non-friend pairs is always 0.
   - The result should be the expected sum of friendship values at the time of being chosen, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is \(n \times (n-1) / 2\). However, the program uses `n * (n - 1) // 1` which is incorrect. It should be `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - The correct calculation should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Accumulation of `a`**:
   - `a` is the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs. This part is correct.

3. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The loop that calculates `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation involves summing the expected friendship values for each excursion.
   - The correct approach is to consider the expected increase in friendship values due to previous excursions and the initial values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It incorrectly accumulates terms in `s` without properly accounting for the expected values.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Calculate the probability of choosing each friend pair in an excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
- Calculate the expected increase in friendship values due to previous excursions.
- Compute the total expected value and convert it to the required modular form.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
