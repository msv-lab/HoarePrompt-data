t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, m, k) and a list of m tuples (a_i, b_i, f_i). Here, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, a_i != b_i, and f_i is an integer such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. All pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct within each test case.
