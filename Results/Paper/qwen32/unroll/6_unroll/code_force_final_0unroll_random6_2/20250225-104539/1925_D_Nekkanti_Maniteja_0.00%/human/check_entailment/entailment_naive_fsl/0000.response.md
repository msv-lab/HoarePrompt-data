Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs (`n * (n - 1) // 2`). However, it incorrectly uses `1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2` in the `pow` function, which makes `c` equal to `1`. This is incorrect because the probability of selecting any specific pair is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, not `1`.

2. **Incorrect Summation Logic**:
   - The code attempts to sum the expected values but incorrectly uses the modular inverse `c` in the summation. The logic inside the `for i in range(k)` loop does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over the `k` excursions.
   - The code sums up `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` in a manner that does not reflect the correct expected value calculation. The formula used does not align with the expected value computation for the problem.

3. **Handling of Friendship Values**:
   - The code sums up the initial friendship values in `a` but does not correctly incorporate the expected increase in these values over the `k` excursions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions. The expected value for a specific pair can be calculated based on the probability of selecting that pair and the expected increase in its friendship value.

Here is a more correct approach to solving the problem:
1. Calculate the probability of selecting any specific pair, which is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
2. For each friend pair, compute the expected increase in its friendship value over `k` excursions.
3. Sum up the expected values for all pairs and compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the complexity of the problem, a more detailed and mathematically sound implementation is necessary to ensure correctness. The provided code does not meet these requirements.
