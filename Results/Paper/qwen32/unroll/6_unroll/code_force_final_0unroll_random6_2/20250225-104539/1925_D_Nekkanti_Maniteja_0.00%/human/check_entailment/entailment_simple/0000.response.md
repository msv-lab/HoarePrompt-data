Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions, expressed as a fraction `p/q`, and then compute `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

2. **Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines describing each pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case and attempts to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Reads `m` lines of friend pairs and their friendship values.

2. **Calculating the Modulo Inverse**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`. However, this step is incorrect because the denominator in the expected value calculation is `n * (n - 1) // 2` only for the probability of selecting a specific pair, not for the overall expected value computation.

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values**:
   - Sums up all initial friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the expected value using a loop that iterates `k` times, adding terms that are not correctly derived from the expected value formula.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly compute the expected value because:
- The calculation of the modular inverse is misplaced and incorrectly used.
- The loop iterating `k` times does not correctly compute the expected value based on the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:
- Compute the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.
- Use the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
- Calculate the final result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect logic and calculations in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
