### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all chosen pairs for `k` excursions. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is intended to be the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). The program incorrectly calculates it as `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. It should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.
   - This is a critical error because `c` is used to normalize the probabilities.

2. **Accumulation of `a`**:
   - The variable `a` correctly accumulates the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs. This part is correct.

3. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The loop that calculates `s` is incorrect. The program incorrectly accumulates terms in `s` without properly accounting for the expected values.
   - The expected value calculation involves summing the expected friendship values for each excursion, taking into account the probability of choosing each friend pair and the expected increase in friendship values due to previous excursions.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It incorrectly accumulates terms in `s` without properly accounting for the expected values.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Calculate the probability of choosing each friend pair in an excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
- Calculate the expected increase in friendship values due to previous excursions.
- Compute the total expected value and convert it to the required modular form.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues in the program. The program incorrectly calculates the modular inverse and fails to properly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
