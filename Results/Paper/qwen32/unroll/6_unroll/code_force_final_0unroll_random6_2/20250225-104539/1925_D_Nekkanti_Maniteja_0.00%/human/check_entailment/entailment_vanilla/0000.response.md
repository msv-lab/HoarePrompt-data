Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all chosen pairs for k excursions. This expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Key Points**:
   - There are \(n\) children and \(m\) pairs of friends.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value.
   - For each of the \(k\) excursions, a pair is chosen randomly.
   - If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The friendship value of non-friend pairs is always 0.
   - The result should be the expected sum of friendship values at the time of being chosen, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is \(n \times (n-1) / 2\). However, the program uses `n * (n - 1) // 1` which is incorrect. It should be `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - The correct calculation should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Accumulation of `a`**:
   - `a` is the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs. This part is correct.

3. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The loop that calculates `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation involves summing the expected friendship values for each excursion.
   - The correct approach is to consider the expected increase in friendship values due to previous excursions and the initial values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It incorrectly accumulates terms in `s` without properly accounting for the expected values.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Calculate the probability of choosing each friend pair in an excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
- Calculate the expected increase in friendship values due to previous excursions.
- Compute the total expected value and convert it to the required modular form.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
