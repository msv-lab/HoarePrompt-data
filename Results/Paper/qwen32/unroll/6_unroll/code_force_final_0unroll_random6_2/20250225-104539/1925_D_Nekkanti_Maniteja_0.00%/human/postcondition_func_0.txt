The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of nodes `n`, the number of edges `m`, and an integer `k`. For each test case, it also processes `m` lines of input, each representing an edge between two nodes with a feature value. The function calculates and prints a specific value `s` for each test case, which is derived from the provided inputs and is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
