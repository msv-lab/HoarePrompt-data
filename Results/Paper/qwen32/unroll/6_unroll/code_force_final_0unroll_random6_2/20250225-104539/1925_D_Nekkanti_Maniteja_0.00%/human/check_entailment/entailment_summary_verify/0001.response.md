### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program in detail using the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions, expressed as \(\frac{p}{q}\), and output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
- **Inputs**: 
  - Number of children `n`, number of friend pairs `m`, number of excursions `k`.
  - For each friend pair, the indices of the children and their initial friendship value.
- **Output**: The expected sum of friendship values for all excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues Identified in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1`, which is incorrect. It should be the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - **Correct Calculation**: `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Accumulation of `s`**:
   - The program accumulates `s` in a loop that incorrectly assumes the expected value calculation.
   - **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values involves the probability of choosing each friend pair and the expected increase in friendship values due to previous excursions.
   - **Correct Approach**: 
     - Calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.
     - Use the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

3. **Incorrect Loop for `s`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` incorrectly calculates `s` by adding terms that do not represent the expected value.
   - **Correct Formula**: The expected value for each excursion involves summing the expected friendship values for each friend pair and non-friend pairs.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing each friend pair in an excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
2. Calculate the expected increase in friendship values due to previous excursions.
3. Compute the total expected value and convert it to the required modular form.

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
