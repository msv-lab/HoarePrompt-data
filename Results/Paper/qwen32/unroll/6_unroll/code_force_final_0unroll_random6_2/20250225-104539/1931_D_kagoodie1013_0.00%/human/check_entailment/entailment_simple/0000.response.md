### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array `a` for each test case. A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
1. `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0`
2. `(a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0`

The program processes each test case by iterating through the array and using two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the remainders when array elements are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

For each element `num` in the array:
- It calculates `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
- It then checks if there are any previously seen numbers that, when paired with the current number, satisfy the conditions for a beautiful pair.
- This is done by checking if the negative of the current `mod_x` (which corresponds to the required `mod_x` for the sum condition) and the current `mod_y` (which corresponds to the required `mod_y` for the difference condition) are present in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, respectively.
- It updates the count of beautiful pairs based on these checks.
- It updates `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current number's remainders.

The final count of beautiful pairs for each test case is stored in the `results` list, which is then printed.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program is correct. It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and hash maps (dictionaries in Python) to keep track of remainders. The program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
