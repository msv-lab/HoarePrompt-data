You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `n` integers. It calculates a count of specific pairs for each test case based on the modular properties of the integers with respect to `x` and `y`, and returns a list of these counts.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of "beautiful" pairs in an array `a` of length `n`. A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
1. `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one separately. For each test case, it counts the number of beautiful pairs using a clever approach involving modulo arithmetic.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of `a` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - It iterates through each element `num` in the array `a` and calculates:
     - `mod_x = -num % x`: This is the negative of `num` modulo `x`. The negative sign is likely intended to handle cases where `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y` correctly.
     - `mod_y = num % y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - It then increments the count by the sum of the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` corresponding to `mod_x` and `mod_y`, respectively. This is intended to count the number of previous elements that could form a beautiful pair with the current element.
   - Finally, it updates `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's remainders.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is the calculation of `mod_x`. The line `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect for the intended logic. The correct approach should be to find the remainder of `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x`, which translates to finding `a[i] % x` and `a[j] % x` such that `(a[i] % x + a[j] % x) % x == 0`. Similarly, for `a[i] - a[j]` being divisible by `y`, we need `(a[i] % y - a[j] % y) % y == 0`.

### Correct Approach:
Instead of using `mod_x = -num % x`, the program should use `mod_x = num % x` and update the logic accordingly. The correct logic should involve checking pairs of remainders `(mod_x1, mod_x2)` and `(mod_y1, mod_y2)` such that `(mod_x1 + mod_x2) % x == 0` and `(mod_y1 - mod_y2) % y == 0`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`. The logic for counting beautiful pairs needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem.
