Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

### Problem Understanding
A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (with \(1 \le i < j \le n\)) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array \(a\).

### Key Points in the Program
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read and split into tokens.
   - The number of test cases \(t\) is extracted.
   - For each test case, the values of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\) are extracted.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a count to zero.
   - Two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, are used to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
     - `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
     - The count is incremented by the sum of the counts of `mod_x` in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y` in `mod_y_map`.
     - The counts of `mod_x` and `mod_y` in their respective maps are updated.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to the calculation of `mod_x`. Specifically, it states that `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect and should be `mod_x = num % x` for checking the conditions of a beautiful pair.

### Annotation Analysis
The annotations confirm that the state of `test_cases` and `results` is correctly maintained throughout the execution. However, the critical point of concern is the calculation of `mod_x`.

### Correctness Analysis
Let's revisit the conditions for a beautiful pair:
1. \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) which can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
2. \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) which can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

The original program calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`, which is equivalent to finding the remainder when \(-num\) is divided by \(x\). This is indeed the correct approach to find \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).

### Conclusion
The original assessment incorrectly claims that `mod_x = -num % x` is wrong. In fact, it is the correct way to check the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\). The program is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
