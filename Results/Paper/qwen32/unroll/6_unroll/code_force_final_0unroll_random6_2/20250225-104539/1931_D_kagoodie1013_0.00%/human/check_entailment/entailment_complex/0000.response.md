Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to determine the number of "beautiful pairs" in each test case, where a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\),
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

### Key Points of the Program:
1. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to satisfy the first condition (\(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)), we can rewrite it as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
   - For the second condition (\(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)), we can rewrite it as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program maintains two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of elements based on their respective modular values.
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - It calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
     - It increases the count of beautiful pairs by the number of elements previously seen that satisfy the conditions with the current element.
     - It updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to include the current element.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program incorrectly calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`. This is problematic because `-num % x` does not necessarily give the modular inverse of `num` modulo `x`. Instead, it gives the positive equivalent of the negative modulo, which does not align with the intended logic of checking if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
- The correct approach would be to use `(num % x + x) % x` to ensure the positive equivalent of `num % x` and then check against `-num % x` (or equivalently, `(x - num % x) % x`).

### Corrected Approach:
- For each element `num` in the array:
  - Calculate `mod_x` as `(num % x + x) % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
  - Calculate `mod_x_complement` as `(x - num % x) % x`.
  - Increase the count of beautiful pairs by the number of elements previously seen that satisfy the conditions with the current element.
  - Update the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to include the current element.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the improper calculation of `mod_x`. The logic for counting beautiful pairs is flawed, and the program does not correctly implement the required conditions.

Correctness: **False**
