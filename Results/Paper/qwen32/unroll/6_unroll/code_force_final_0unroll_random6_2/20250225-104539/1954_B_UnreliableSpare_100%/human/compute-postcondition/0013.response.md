To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `flag` is `False`.
   - `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`.
   - `val` is `arr[0]`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive `val` elements at the end of the array.
   - `flag` remains `False`.

2. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `flag` is explicitly `False`.
   - `val` is explicitly `arr[0]`, but the value of `arr[0]` is not specified.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive `val` elements at the end of the array, but the array `arr` and its elements are not specified.
   - `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`. However, the initial value of `ans` is not provided.

Since the initial value of `ans` is not given, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. Without knowing the original value of `ans` and the value of `cnt`, we can only describe `ans` in terms of these variables.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(ans)`.
   - Given the information, `ans` is the minimum of its original value and `cnt`.

Therefore, the output will be described in terms of `ans` being the minimum of its original value and `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of its original value and cnt)**
