Postcondition: **`flag` is `False`; `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the count of consecutive `val` elements at the end of the array. The `flag` remains `False` regardless of the initial value.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `flag` will always be `False`, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between its original value and `cnt`, `val` will still be `arr[0]`, and `cnt` will still represent the count of consecutive `val` elements at the end of the array.
