`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 <= `k_i` <= 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
