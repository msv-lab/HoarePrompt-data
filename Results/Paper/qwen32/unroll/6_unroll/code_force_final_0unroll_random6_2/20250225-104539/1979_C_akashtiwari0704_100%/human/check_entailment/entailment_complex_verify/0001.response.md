### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the annotations and the problem description to ensure the correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Calculating LCM:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` using the helper function `lcm`. The LCM calculation is correct as it iteratively computes the LCM using the greatest common divisor (GCD).

3. **Determining Bets:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the program calculates the bet as `prod // k_i`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - The sum of these bets is then computed.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the total sum of bets is greater than or equal to the LCM (`prod`), the program outputs `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the coins as required.
   - Otherwise, the program outputs the calculated bets.

### Verification of Logic

- **LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that `prod` is a common multiple of all `k_i`. This means that for any outcome `i`, `prod // k_i` is an integer.

- **Bet Calculation:**
  - The bet for each outcome `i` is set to `prod // k_i`. This ensures that if outcome `i` wins, the received amount is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`.
  - The sum of all bets is `sumo = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (prod // k_i)`.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The program checks if `sumo` is less than `prod`. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, then for any winning outcome `i`, the received amount `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod` is strictly greater than the total sum of bets `sumo`.
  - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it is correctly determined that no valid distribution of bets exists, and the program outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the feasibility of the solution. If a solution exists, it guarantees that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

### Final: **True**
