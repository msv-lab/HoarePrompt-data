Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The task is to distribute coins across `n` possible outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. For each winning outcome `i`, the received amount is `k_i * bet_i`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each with a different number of outcomes and their respective multipliers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Calculating LCM:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. This is done using a helper function `lcm` which iteratively computes the LCM using the greatest common divisor (GCD).

3. **Determining Bets:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the program calculates the bet as `prod // k_i`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - The program then sums up all these bets.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the total sum of bets is greater than or equal to the LCM (`prod`), the program outputs `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the coins as required.
   - Otherwise, the program outputs the calculated bets.

### Correctness Analysis
Let's verify if this logic correctly solves the problem:

- **LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the product `prod` is a common multiple of all `k_i`. This means that for any outcome `i`, `prod // k_i` is an integer.

- **Bet Calculation:**
  - The bet for each outcome `i` is set to `prod // k_i`. This ensures that if outcome `i` wins, the received amount is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`, which is strictly greater than the total sum of bets if the sum of bets is less than `prod`.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The program correctly checks if the sum of bets is less than `prod`. If not, it outputs `-1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the feasibility of the solution. If a solution exists, it guarantees that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
