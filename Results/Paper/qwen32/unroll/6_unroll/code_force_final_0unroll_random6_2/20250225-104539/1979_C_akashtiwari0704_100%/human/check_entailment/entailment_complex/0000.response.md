### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of outcomes) and the list `a` of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple of the list `a`. This is done by iteratively computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current LCM and the next number in the list, and then updating the LCM accordingly.

3. **Bet Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier `k_i`. This ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received in the case of any winning outcome.
   - The sum of these bets is computed.

4. **Output**:
   - If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program outputs `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets in a way that guarantees a profit in any outcome.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the list of bets.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **LCM and Bet Calculation**:
  - The approach of using the LCM ensures that each bet `x_i` satisfies the condition that `k_i * x_i` (the amount received if the i-th outcome is winning) is greater than the total sum of bets.
  - By setting `x_i = LCM / k_i`, the program ensures that `k_i * x_i = LCM`, which is greater than the sum of all bets (which is `LCM - x_i` summed over all `i`).

- **Sum of Bets**:
  - The sum of the bets is `LCM - x_i` summed over all `i`, which simplifies to `LCM - (LCM / k_1 + LCM / k_2 + ... + LCM / k_n)`.
  - Since `LCM / k_i` is the bet for the i-th outcome, the sum of all bets is `LCM - (LCM / k_1 + LCM / k_2 + ... + LCM / k_n)`, which is always less than `LCM` if the denominators `k_i` are greater than 1 (which they are, as per the problem constraints).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where it's impossible to distribute the bets to guarantee a profit, as it checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM and outputs `-1` in such cases.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that guarantees a profit in any winning outcome.

**Correctness: True**
