The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `bets` and a list `a` of `bets` integers. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list, then modifies each integer in the list to be the LCM divided by that integer. If the sum of these modified integers is greater than or equal to the LCM, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the modified list of integers.
