### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations where we choose a subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements of that subarray to this MEX.
- The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

#### Code Analysis:

##### Function `func_1(lst)`:
- This function is intended to find a subarray that, when replaced by its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
- It calculates `sm` as the sum of the array excluding the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` plus the square of the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. 
- However, it does not compute the MEX of the subarray, which is crucial for the problem.
- The logic for maximizing the sum based on the MEX operation is flawed.

##### Function `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`:
- This function appears to recursively add operations to the `ops` list.
- The recursive calls and the logic for adding operations do not align with the problem's requirements, particularly the MEX operation.

##### Function `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`:
- This function adds several operations to the `ops` list and then replaces the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` with the length of the subarray `n`.
- Replacing the subarray with its length does not guarantee the maximum sum because it does not consider the MEX operation.

##### Main Code Logic:
- The main code reads the input, initializes `ops`, and calls `func_1` to find the indices `(r, l)`.
- It then repeatedly calls `func_3` to perform operations and update the list until `r == l`.
- Finally, it tries to replace any remaining `0`s with `1`s and prints the sum and the operations.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state before and after key function calls.
- They confirm that `func_1` does not compute the MEX and that `func_3` replaces subarrays with their lengths without considering the MEX.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the code does not compute the MEX and that the logic for maximizing the sum is flawed.
- The annotations support this assessment by showing that the critical MEX operation is missing.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array based on the MEX operation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
