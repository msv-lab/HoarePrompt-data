### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code and the logic behind it. Let's delve deeper into the specifics:

1. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The problem fundamentally hinges on the correct calculation of the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) for any subarray. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The function `func_1` does not compute the MEX; instead, it calculates a hypothetical sum based on the square of the subarray length, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements. This approach is inherently flawed because it does not consider the actual values in the subarray and their implications on the MEX.

2. **Operation Construction:**
   - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are designed to append operations to the `ops` list, but they do so without considering the correct MEX value for any subarray. The recursive nature of `func_2` does not provide a mechanism to ensure that the operations contribute to maximizing the sum of the array.
   - `func_3` attempts to replace a subarray with its length, which is not a valid strategy for maximizing the sum because it does not take into account the MEX operation.

3. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array by strategically choosing subarrays and setting them to their MEX values. The provided code does not implement this strategy correctly, leading to incorrect results.
   - The assessment correctly points out that the logic for finding the maximum sum and constructing the sequence of operations is flawed.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the MEX operation and fails to maximize the sum of the array as per the problem's requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the provided program is incorrect. Thus, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
