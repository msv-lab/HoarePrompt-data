The code appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, but `ops` now includes this new list as its last element. The conditions `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)` still hold true for the initial state of `r` and `l`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers with the last element being `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**
