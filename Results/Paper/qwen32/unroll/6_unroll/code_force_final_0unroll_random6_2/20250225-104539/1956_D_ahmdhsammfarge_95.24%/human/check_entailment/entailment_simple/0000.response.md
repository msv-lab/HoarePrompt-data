### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and the annotated functions to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1(lst)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum `sm` of the array after replacing the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` with the MEX of that subarray.
   - **Implementation**: The function iterates over all possible subarrays, calculates the potential new sum `sm` if the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` is replaced by its MEX, and keeps track of the maximum `sm` found.
   - **Output**: Returns the indices `r` and `l` that maximize `sm`.

2. **Function `func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To add operations to `ops` that set the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to its MEX.
   - **Implementation**: The function recursively adds operations to `ops` in a way that sets the subarray to its MEX.
   - **Output**: Modifies `ops` in place.

3. **Function `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To apply the operation that sets the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to its MEX and updates the list `lst`.
   - **Implementation**: Adds operations to `ops`, checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0, and then sets the subarray to its MEX.
   - **Output**: Modifies `lst` in place and returns the updated `lst`.

4. **Main Program**:
   - **Purpose**: To maximize the sum of the array `lst` by performing the operations described.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - Calls `func_1` to find the subarray that maximizes the sum.
     - Calls `func_3` to apply the operation on that subarray and update `lst`.
     - Repeats the above steps until no further improvement can be made.
     - Tries to replace any remaining 0s with 1s.
   - **Output**: Prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Function `func_1(lst)`**: The function calculates the potential new sum `sm` by assuming the MEX of the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` is always `j - i + 1`. This is incorrect because the MEX is not necessarily the length of the subarray. It is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
- **Function `func_2(r, l, ops)`**: This function is not used correctly in the main program. It seems to be intended to add operations to `ops`, but it is not used in a way that ensures the MEX operation is correctly applied.
- **Function `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**: This function correctly adds operations to `ops` and updates `lst`, but it relies on `func_1` to provide the correct subarray indices, which are incorrect due to the issue in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of subarrays and does not apply the operations in a way that maximizes the sum of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
