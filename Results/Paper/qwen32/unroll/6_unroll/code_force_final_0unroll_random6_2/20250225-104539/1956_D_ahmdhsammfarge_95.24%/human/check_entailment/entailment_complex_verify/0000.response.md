### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: To find the subarray `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum when replaced by its MEX value.
- **Implementation**: The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray, not the MEX value. The sum is calculated as the sum of elements outside the subarray plus the square of the subarray's length. This is incorrect because the MEX value should be computed, and the sum should be updated based on this MEX value.
- **Annotation**: The annotation states that `r` and `l` will be the indices that maximize `sm`, but `sm` is not the correct metric since it does not account for the MEX value.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: To generate operations to replace subarrays.
- **Implementation**: The function recursively adds operations in a way that does not align with the problem requirements. It does not generate operations based on the MEX value.
- **Annotation**: The annotation indicates that the function modifies the `ops` list in a recursive manner, but this does not align with the problem's logic.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
- **Purpose**: To perform the operations and update the list.
- **Implementation**: The function attempts to perform the operations and update the list but does so incorrectly. It does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not generate the operations in a way that maximizes the sum.
- **Annotation**: The annotation states that the function modifies the list and appends operations, but the operations are not based on the MEX value.

#### Main Logic:
- **Purpose**: To maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations.
- **Implementation**: The main logic uses `func_1` to find the subarray to replace, then `func_3` to perform the replacement and update the list, and finally handles any remaining zeros.
- **Annotation**: The annotation indicates that the main logic iterates over the list, finds subarrays, and performs replacements, but the approach is flawed due to the incorrect computation of the MEX value and the generation of operations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the following steps should be taken:
1. **Compute the MEX value**: For each subarray, compute the MEX value, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
2. **Replace the subarray**: Replace the subarray with the MEX value if it increases the sum.
3. **Generate operations**: Generate the operations to achieve this replacement.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
Explanation:
- Replace the subarray `[3, 3]` with `0` (MEX value of `[2]` is `0`), resulting in `[1, 100, 0, 1]`.
- Replace the subarray `[3, 4]` with `2` (MEX value of `[0, 1]` is `2`), resulting in `[1, 100, 2, 2]`.
- The sum is `1 + 100 + 2 + 2 = 105`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. The main issues lie in the incorrect computation of the MEX value and the generation of operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
