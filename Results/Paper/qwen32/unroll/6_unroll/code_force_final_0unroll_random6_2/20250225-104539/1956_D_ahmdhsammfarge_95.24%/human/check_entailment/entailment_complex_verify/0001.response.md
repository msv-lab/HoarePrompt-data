### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical flaws in the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **MEX Computation:**
   - The problem requires computing the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) of a subarray to determine the value to which the subarray should be set. The provided code does not compute the MEX at all. Instead, it computes a sum that includes the square of the subarray length, which is unrelated to the MEX operation.
   
2. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array by performing the operations optimally. The code attempts to find a subarray that maximizes a computed sum but does not consider the MEX, which is essential for achieving the maximum sum.
   
3. **Operation Sequence:**
   - The sequence of operations constructed by the code does not follow the logic required to maximize the sum. The operations are appended in a manner that does not ensure the MEX operation is performed correctly.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Function `func_1(lst)`:**
  - This function is supposed to find the optimal subarray to modify, but it does not compute the MEX. It instead computes a sum that includes the square of the subarray length, which is not relevant to the problem.
  
- **Function `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`:**
  - This function appends operations to the `ops` list in a recursive manner. However, the operations appended do not correspond to the MEX operation or any strategy to maximize the sum.
  
- **Function `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`:**
  - This function appends several operations and then replaces the subarray with its length. This replacement does not guarantee the maximum sum because it does not consider the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the MEX operation, which is essential for solving the problem. The logic for finding the maximum sum and constructing the sequence of operations is flawed. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
