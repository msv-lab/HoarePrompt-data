### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing operations where we can choose a subarray and replace all its elements with the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
- The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set.
- The operations should be performed no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the optimal subarray to replace with its MEX value to maximize the sum.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates a new sum based on the square of the length of the subarray. However, this is incorrect. The sum should be calculated based on the MEX value of the subarray, not the square of the length.
   - The function incorrectly assumes that the sum of the subarray can be maximized by simply considering the length of the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is recursive and is intended to generate the operations to replace subarrays.
   - However, it does not generate operations based on the MEX value but rather in a recursive manner that does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the operations and update the list.
   - It appends operations to the list `ops` and updates the list `lst` by setting all elements in the range `[r, l]` to `n` (the length of the range).
   - The function does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray and does not generate the operations in a way that maximizes the sum.

#### Evaluation:
- **Function `func_1`**: The logic is fundamentally flawed as it does not compute the MEX value of subarrays. It incorrectly calculates a new sum based on the length of the subarray, which is not the correct approach.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function's logic is also incorrect as it does not generate operations based on the MEX value.
- **Function `func_3`**: This function does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not generate operations that maximize the sum.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
  - Compute the MEX value for each subarray.
  - Replace the subarray with this MEX value if it increases the sum.
  - Generate the operations to achieve this replacement.

Given the provided code and the function summaries, it is clear that the code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
