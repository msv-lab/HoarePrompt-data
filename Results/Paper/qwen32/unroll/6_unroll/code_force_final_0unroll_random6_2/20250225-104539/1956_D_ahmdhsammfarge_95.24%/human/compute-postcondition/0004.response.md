The code snippet `ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])` appends a new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops` regardless of the condition mentioned in the initial state. 

The initial state specifies that `r` and `l` are integers within the bounds of the list `lst`, and `ops` is a list that may or may not include an operation based on the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`. However, the given code snippet does not check this condition; it simply appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to `ops`.

Therefore, the value of `ops` changes by adding the new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers. Now, `ops` includes an additional operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**
