Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers with the last element being `[r + 1, l + 1]`. Additionally, the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0. `ops` now includes the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `ops` now contains an additional entry `[r + 1, l + 1]`, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged.
