Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r` and `l` which are integers representing a range within the list `lst`, and `lst` which is a list of integers. It also accepts `ops`, which is a list that will store operations. The function modifies the list `lst` such that all elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are set to the value `n`, where `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. The function returns the modified list `lst`.**
