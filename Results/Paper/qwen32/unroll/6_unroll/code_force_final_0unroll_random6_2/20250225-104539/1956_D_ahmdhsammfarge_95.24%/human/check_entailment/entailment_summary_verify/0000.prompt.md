You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function modifies a list `lst` by setting all elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the specified range (`l - r + 1`). It also appends operations to the list `ops`. The function returns the modified list `lst`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. Let's analyze the issues:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find the optimal subarray `[r, l]` to replace with its MEX value to maximize the sum. However, the implementation does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray. Instead, it simply calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray and compares it to the current sum, which is not the correct approach.
   - The MEX value should be computed as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the sum should be updated based on this MEX value, not the square of the length of the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate the operations to replace subarrays but is not correctly implemented. It does not generate the operations based on the MEX value but rather in a recursive manner that does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the operations and update the list but does so incorrectly. It does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray and does not generate the operations in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the MEX value for each subarray.
2. Replace the subarray with this MEX value if it increases the sum.
3. Generate the operations to achieve this replacement.

### Example Case:
Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
Explanation:
- Replace the subarray `[3, 3]` with `0` (MEX value of `[2]` is `0`), resulting in `[1, 100, 0, 1]`.
- Replace the subarray `[3, 4]` with `2` (MEX value of `[0, 1]` is `2`), resulting in `[1, 100, 2, 2]`.
- The sum is `1 + 100 + 2 + 2 = 105`.

The provided code does not correctly implement these steps, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.
