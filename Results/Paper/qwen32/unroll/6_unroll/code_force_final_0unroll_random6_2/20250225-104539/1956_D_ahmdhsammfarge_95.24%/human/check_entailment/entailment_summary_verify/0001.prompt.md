You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function modifies a list `lst` by setting all elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the specified range (`l - r + 1`). It also appends operations to the list `ops`. The function returns the modified list `lst`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations.
   - Each operation allows us to choose a subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements of that subarray to this MEX.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**

   - **Function `func_1(lst)`:**
     - This function seems to be trying to find a pair of indices `(r, l)` that maximize the sum of the array if we were to replace the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` with a constant value.
     - It computes the sum of the array excluding the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and adds the square of the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.
     - However, this approach does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray, and the logic for finding the maximum sum is flawed. The MEX operation is critical for maximizing the sum, but this function does not compute it.

   - **Function `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`:**
     - This function appears to recursively append operations to the `ops` list.
     - The logic seems to be broken as it does not properly handle the MEX operation and the goal of maximizing the sum.

   - **Function `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`:**
     - This function seems to append several operations to the `ops` list and then replaces the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` with the length of the subarray `n`.
     - The replacement with `n` does not guarantee the maximum sum because it does not consider the MEX operation.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The code does not correctly implement the MEX operation.
   - The logic for finding the maximum sum and constructing the sequence of operations is flawed.
   - The provided code does not guarantee that the maximum possible sum is achieved, nor does it correctly compute the sequence of operations.

Based on the analysis, the provided code is incorrect.
