The code snippet `lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]` replaces the slice of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a new list containing `n` elements, all of which are `n`. Given that `n` is `l - r + 1`, the slice being replaced will have the same length as the new list, so the overall length of `lst` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of integers where `lst[r:l + 1]` is now a list of `n` elements, each equal to `n`, `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers and includes the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` and the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the elements in `lst` from index `r` to `l` have been replaced with `n` elements, each having the value `n`. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
