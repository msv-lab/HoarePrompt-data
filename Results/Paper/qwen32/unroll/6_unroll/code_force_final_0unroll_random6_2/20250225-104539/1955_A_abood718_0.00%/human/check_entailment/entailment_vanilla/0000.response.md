Let's analyze the program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

**Objective:**  
Minimize the cost of buying `n` yogurts, given that the price of one yogurt is `a` burles and the price of two yogurts in promotion is `b` burles.

**Approach:**
1. **If the promotion price for two yogurts is more expensive than buying two individually (`b * 2 >= a`):**
   - Buy each yogurt individually. The total cost is `n * a`.
   
2. **If the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying two individually (`b * 2 < a`):**
   - Maximize the number of yogurts bought in promotion.
   - If `n` is even, buy all yogurts in promotion. The total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in promotion and the last one individually. The total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Program Analysis

Let's compare the program logic with the approach described above:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition for Promotion:**
   - The program checks if `b * 2 < a`. This is correct as it determines if the promotion is beneficial.
   - If `b * 2 < a`, it calculates the cost as `n * a`. However, this part of the code is incorrect. The correct action here should be to buy as many pairs as possible and the remaining yogurt individually if `n` is odd. This part of the condition should be reviewed.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - The program correctly calculates the cost as `(n * b) / 2` when `n` is even.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - The program correctly calculates the cost as `((n - 1) * b) / 2 + a` when `n` is odd.

### Correctness Analysis

- The program's first condition (`if B * 2 < C`) is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if B * 2 > C` to determine if the promotion is beneficial.
- The logic for calculating the cost when `n` is odd is correct.
- The logic for calculating the cost when `n` is even is correct.

### Correct Implementation

The correct code should be:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b * 2 > a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            pairs = n // 2
            remaining = n % 2
            print(pairs * b + remaining * a)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to an incorrect condition for determining when to use the promotion.

**Correctness: False**
