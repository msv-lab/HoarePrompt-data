Reasoning:
The program is intended to compute the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the prices `a` (for one yogurt) and `b` (for two yogurts during a promotion). The logic in the program has some issues that prevent it from always producing the correct result.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic and the issues:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - The first `if` condition checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price (`B * 2 < C`). If true, it prints `A * B` (which seems incorrect because `A` should be `n` and `B` should be `a`, but the logic here is flawed for the given problem description).
   - The second `elif` condition checks if `n` is even. If true, it calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which again seems incorrect as `A` should be `n` and `C` should be `b`. The correct calculation should be `(n // 2) * b`.
   - The `else` block handles the case when `n` is odd. It calculates the number of pairs of yogurts (`X = A // 2`), which should be `n // 2`, and then calculates the total cost as `X * C + B`, which should be `(n // 2) * b + a`.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If `n` is even, the minimum cost is `(n // 2) * b`.
     - If `n` is odd, the minimum cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are used instead of `n`, `a`, and `b` in the calculations, which is incorrect.
   - The logic in the `if` and `elif` conditions is flawed and does not correctly implement the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
