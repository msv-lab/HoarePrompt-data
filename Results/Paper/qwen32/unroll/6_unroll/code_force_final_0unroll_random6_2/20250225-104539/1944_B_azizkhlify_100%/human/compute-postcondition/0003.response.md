Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints `k` pairs of numbers from the first half of the array, followed by up to `k` individual numbers from the first half if needed, and finally pairs from the second half if the counts do not match. The output is formatted such that pairs are printed first, followed by individual numbers, and then additional pairs from the second half if necessary.**
