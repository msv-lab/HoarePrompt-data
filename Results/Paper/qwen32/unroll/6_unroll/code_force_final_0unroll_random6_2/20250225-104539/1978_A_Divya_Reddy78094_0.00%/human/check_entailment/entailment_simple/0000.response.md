### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing her books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. To achieve this, the optimal strategy is to always select the two books with the highest number of pages. This is because these two books will always yield the maximum possible sum of pages that can be read from two separate piles.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Sorting**: The list of pages is sorted in descending order. This makes it easy to access the two largest elements.

3. **Output Calculation**: The program prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which are the two largest numbers.

4. **Repetition**: This process is repeated for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided program, the program correctly calculates the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by always selecting the two largest books. This is because the two largest books will always provide the maximum sum when divided into two separate piles.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
