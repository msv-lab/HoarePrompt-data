Reasoning:  
The game described is a classic example of a combinatorial game where the outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins. Here's why the provided program is correct:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position. This is because Alice can always make the total number of coins even after her turn, and Bob will always be left with an odd total, eventually leading to a situation where Bob cannot make a move.
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position. This is because Bob can always make the total number of coins odd after his turn, and Alice will always be left with an even total, eventually leading to a situation where Alice cannot make a move.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly checks the parity of the sum of coins `a + b` using the bitwise AND operation `a + b & 1`. If the result is `0`, the sum is even, and the program outputs 'Bob'. If the result is `1`, the sum is odd, and the program outputs 'Alice'.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary confirms that the program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, checks the parity of their sum, and prints the correct winner based on the parity.

Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Correctness: **True**
