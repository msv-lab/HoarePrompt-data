### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The game revolves around the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If the sum is even, Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum is even using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1 == 0`).
     - If the result is `0`, the sum is even, and it prints "Bob".
     - If the result is `1`, the sum is odd, and it prints "Alice".

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The bitwise AND operation `a + b & 1` is an efficient way to check the parity of the sum.
   - `a + b & 1` will be `0` if the sum is even and `1` if the sum is odd.

4. **Validation with Example Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles all the provided example cases, producing the expected outputs.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the code, confirming that it prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets. It handles all the given example cases correctly and does not seem to have any logical errors for the provided problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
