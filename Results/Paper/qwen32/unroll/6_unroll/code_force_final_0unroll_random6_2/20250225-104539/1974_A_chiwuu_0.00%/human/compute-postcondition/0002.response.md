To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it processes the input for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the loop reads two integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Calculation of `t`**:
   - `t` is initially set to `b * 2`.
   - If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is set to `t // 5`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`.
3. **Calculation of `t1`**:
   - `t1` is set to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
4. **Adjustment of `t`**:
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
5. **Output**: The final value of `t` is printed.

Given the initial state with `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing the final value of `t` after processing the corresponding test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently, the output state will simply be the sequence of final `t` values for each test case.

Output State: **the final values of `t` for each of the `t` test cases, each on a new line.**
