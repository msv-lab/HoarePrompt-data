You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 1x1 application icons and `y` is the number of 2x2 application icons. It calculates and prints the minimum number of 5x5 grids required to cover all the icons for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is supposed to calculate the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons.

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
    - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
    - `t = b * 2`: This calculates the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
    - `t = t // 5 + 1 if t % 5 != 0 else t // 5`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, we need to calculate how many screens are needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells**:
    - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
    - `t2 = a - t1`: This calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed after placing the 2x2 icons.
    - `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1 if t2 % 15 != 0 else t + t2 // 15`: This calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with some of the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
    - Input: `1 1`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
    - Input: `7 2`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
    - Input: `12 4`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
    - Input: `0 3`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
    - Input: `1 0`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**:
    - Input: `8 1`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7**:
    - Input: `0 0`
    - Expected Output: `0`
    - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

8. **Test Case 8**:
    - Input: `2 0`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

9. **Test Case 9**:
    - Input: `15 0`
    - Expected Output: `1`
    - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

10. **Test Case 10**:
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

11. **Test Case 11**:
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Expected Output: `5`
    - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program seems to handle all the provided test cases correctly. However, to ensure the program is correct for all potential cases, we need to consider edge cases such as the maximum possible values of `a` and `b` (99 each) and other combinations that might challenge the logic.

### Edge Cases

1. **Maximum Icons**:
    - Input: `99 99`
    - Expected Output: `198` (since each 2x2 icon needs 4 cells and each screen has 15 cells, 99 * 4 = 396 cells, which need 27 screens for 2x2 icons and 99 * 1 = 99 cells, which need 7 screens for 1x1 icons, total 34 screens, but since 2x2 icons are placed first, the remaining cells are not enough to fit all 1x1 icons, hence 198 screens are needed).

2. **No Icons**:
    - Input: `0 0`
    - Expected Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Only 1x1 Icons**:
    - Input: `15 0`
    - Expected Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Only 2x2 Icons**:
    - Input: `0 99`
    - Expected Output: `396 // 15 = 26.4 -> 27` (Correct)

The program seems to handle these cases correctly as well. However, the logic for handling the maximum number of icons might need re-evaluation since the provided program does not seem to correctly handle the maximum case.

### Final Answer

After re-evaluating the logic, we find that the program does not correctly handle the maximum case where both `a` and `b` are 99. The program does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed in this case.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation

The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons are both at their maximum values (99 each). The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for the maximum case is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output.
