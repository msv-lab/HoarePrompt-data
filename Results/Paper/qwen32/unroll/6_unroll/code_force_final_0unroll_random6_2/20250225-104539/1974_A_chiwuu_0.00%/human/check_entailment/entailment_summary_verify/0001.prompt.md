You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of 1x1 application icons and `y` is the number of 2x2 application icons. It calculates and prints the minimum number of 5x5 grids required to cover all the icons for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place x number of 1x1 icons and y number of 2x2 icons. Each screen can be filled with 15 1x1 icons or a combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons that fit within the 15-cell capacity of the screen.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `a` and the number of 2x2 icons `b`.
3. It calculates a temporary value `t` which is the minimum number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the formula `t = b * 2` (which should be `t = b * 4` to calculate the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons) is incorrect. However, the intention seems to be to calculate the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons, which would be `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15` (rounding up the division).
4. It then calculates `t1`, which represents the remaining capacity of the screens used for 2x2 icons in terms of 1x1 icons. This calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for the space taken by 2x2 icons.
5. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means the existing screens are sufficient, and no additional screens are needed for 1x1 icons. Otherwise, it calculates the number of additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
6. The program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case.

The logic in the program has several issues:
- The calculation for `t` (number of screens for 2x2 icons) is incorrect.
- The calculation for `t1` (remaining capacity in terms of 1x1 icons) is incorrect.
- The logic for adding additional screens for 1x1 icons is not correctly implemented.

Let's consider a corrected approach:
1. Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons: `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15`.
2. Calculate the remaining capacity of these screens in terms of 1x1 icons: `remaining_capacity = t * 15 - b * 4`.
3. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons: `additional_screens = (a - remaining_capacity + 14) // 15` if `remaining_capacity < a`, otherwise `additional_screens = 0`.
4. The total number of screens needed is `t + additional_screens`.

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed.
