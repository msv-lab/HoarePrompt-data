The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The `numbers` list being empty does not affect whether the loop will execute, as it is not referenced in the loop head.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `numbers` is an empty list**
