You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of length at most 10. For each string, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string, which could be a rotated version of the string or its reverse, depending on specific conditions. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Input**: A number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` strings `s` (each of length up to 10).
- **Output**: For each string `s`, output "YES" if it's possible to rearrange the characters to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If not possible, output "NO".
- **Constraints**: If multiple answers are possible, any valid rearrangement is acceptable.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking Unique Characters**:
   - It creates a set `a` from the characters of `s` to count unique characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in the string.

3. **Generating New String**:
   - If there are more than one unique character, it outputs "YES".
   - It then attempts to generate a new string by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half.
   - If the generated string is not equal to the original string, it prints the generated string.
   - If the generated string is equal to the original string, it tries the reversed string.
   - If the reversed string is also equal to the original string, it tries another approach (which seems incorrect as it concatenates the second half with the first character of the first half).

4. **Handling Single Character Case**:
   - If there is only one unique character in the string, it outputs "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Rearrangement Logic**:
   - The logic for generating a new string is flawed. For example, if `s = "xxxy"`, the generated string `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]` would be `"xyxx"`, which is indeed different from `"xxxy"`. However, the logic does not handle all cases correctly.
   - If `s = "xyxy"`, the generated string `"xyxy"` will be the same as the original string, and the reversed string `"yxxy"` might also be the same or not a valid rearrangement in some cases.
   - The final fallback approach `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]` is also incorrect and does not guarantee a valid rearrangement.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when the string length is small or when the characters are distributed in a way that simple concatenation or reversal does not work.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee to produce a valid rearrangement for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to handle all edge cases correctly and does not guarantee to produce a valid rearrangement for all possible inputs. For example, the string `"xyxy"` would not be handled correctly by the current logic.
