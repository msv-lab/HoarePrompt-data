### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally in the card game described. 

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads from standard input using `open(0)`, which is a common way to read input in competitive programming.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes every second line thereafter, which are the sequences of integers representing the cards in your hand for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each line (representing the cards in your hand), it splits the line into tokens (card numbers) and stores them in the variable `tokens`.
   - It then calculates the length of `tokens` (the total number of cards you have) and subtracts the length of the set created from `tokens` (the number of unique card values).
   - The result of this subtraction represents the number of duplicate card values in your hand.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Logic of the Program:**
  - The program correctly identifies the number of duplicate card values in your hand, which is the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally.
  - This is because, in the optimal strategy, you would always play a duplicate card if possible to score a point. Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, she will prevent you from scoring more than the number of duplicate cards you have.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
  - It efficiently calculates the number of duplicate cards in your hand, which is the maximum number of points you can earn.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program is correct in terms of logic and output for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
