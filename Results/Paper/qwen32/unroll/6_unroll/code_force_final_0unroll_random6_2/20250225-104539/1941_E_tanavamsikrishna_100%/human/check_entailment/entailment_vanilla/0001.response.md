To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid. The grid has `n` rows and `m` columns where the first and last columns are river banks with depth 0. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. Supports must be installed in the first and last columns and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

### Solution Analysis
The solution consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(row, d):** This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row under the given constraints.
2. **func_2():** This function reads the input, applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of installing supports for a single bridge on each row, then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive bridges.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`
1. **Initialization:**
   - The first element of the row is set to 1 (`row[0] = 1`).
   - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2 (`row[i] = row[i] + 2` for `i` in `1` to `d-1`).
   
2. **Heap-based Calculation:**
   - A min-heap is created from the first `d` elements of the row.
   - For each subsequent element in the row, the heap is used to find the minimum cost of placing a support such that the distance constraint is respected.
   - The heap is updated with the new cost and the current element.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns the cost of installing supports for the entire row.

#### Function `func_2()`
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are read.
   - The grid of river depths is read.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `func_1` is applied to each row to calculate the cost of installing supports for a single bridge on that row.
   - The costs for `k` consecutive rows are summed up, and the minimum sum is found.

3. **Output:**
   - The minimum total cost for `k` consecutive bridges is printed.

### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Initialization in `func_1`:**
   - The first and last columns are always 0, and the cost of installing supports there is 1 (`0 + 1`).
   - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2, which seems correct for initializing the heap with the first `d` elements.

2. **Heap-based Calculation:**
   - The heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost while respecting the distance constraint.
   - The heap is updated correctly with the new cost and the current element.

3. **Cost Calculation in `func_2`:**
   - The costs for each row are calculated correctly using `func_1`.
   - The minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is found by summing up the costs and taking the minimum.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It initializes the row costs correctly, uses a heap to efficiently find the minimum cost while respecting constraints, and correctly calculates the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive bridges.

Correctness: **True**
