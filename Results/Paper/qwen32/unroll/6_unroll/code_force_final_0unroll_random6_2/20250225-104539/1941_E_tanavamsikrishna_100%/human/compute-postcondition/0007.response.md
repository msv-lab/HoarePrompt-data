Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n` and `m` as positive integers representing the number of rows and columns in a grid, `k` as a positive integer representing the number of consecutive rows for which bridges are to be built, and `d` as a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports. It also accepts `rows` as a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each sublist being 0. The function returns a value (not specified in the output details) based on these inputs, likely indicating success or failure of building bridges under the given constraints.**
