### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if it meets the requirements.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge has supports that need to be installed at specific cells.
   - The cost of installing a support at cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - Supports must be installed at the first and last columns of each row.
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost for a single row.
   - It initializes the first element to `1` and the next `d-1` elements to `row[i] + 2`.
   - It then uses a min-heap to ensure that each subsequent element is influenced by the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d`.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified list `row`, which represents the minimum cost for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input parameters and the grid.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then computes the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements and uses a min-heap to ensure that each subsequent element is influenced by the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d`.
  - The function returns the last element of the modified list, which represents the minimum cost for that row.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads the input parameters and the grid.
  - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - It then computes the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
  - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1` and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows using `func_2`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
