To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the given code:

1. We are given a 2D list `rows` with `n` sublists, each containing `m` integers.
2. We have a list `costs` where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to each row in `rows`.
3. `total_costs` is initialized as an empty list.
4. The loop iterates over `costs` from index `0` to `len(costs) - k`, summing up `k` consecutive elements from `costs` and appending each sum to `total_costs`.

The loop essentially calculates the sum of every possible `k`-sized contiguous sublist within `costs` and appends these sums to `total_costs`.

Let's calculate the final state of `total_costs`:

- The loop runs `len(costs) - (k - 1)` times, which is the number of possible `k`-sized sublists in `costs`.
- For each iteration, the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs` is computed and added to `total_costs`.

After the loop finishes, `total_costs` will contain the sums of all `k`-sized contiguous sublists from `costs`.

Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every possible `k`-sized contiguous sublist within `costs`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
