Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task involves minimizing the cost of installing supports for bridges over a river grid. The river grid is represented as an `n x m` matrix where `a_{i,1}` and `a_{i,m}` are always 0 (river banks). The cost of placing a support in a cell `(i,j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. For each bridge, supports must be placed at the river banks `(i,1)` and `(i,m)`, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row.
   - It initializes the first `d` supports with incremental costs.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports within the distance `d`.
   - It iterates through the row, updating the cost of placing a support in each cell based on the minimum cost of placing a support in the previous `d` cells.
   - The final cost for the row is the cost of placing a support in the last cell.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input for a test case.
   - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the river grid `rows`.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
   - It calculates the total cost for placing `k` consecutive bridges starting from each possible row.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible starting rows.

### Correctness

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the problem's requirements:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly initializes the first `d` supports with incremental costs.
  - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports within the distance `d`.
  - The cost calculation for each cell is based on the minimum cost within the previous `d` cells, ensuring that the distance constraint is respected.
  - The final cost for the row is correctly calculated as the cost of placing a support in the last cell.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads the input and initializes the river grid.
  - It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
  - It calculates the total cost for placing `k` consecutive bridges starting from each possible row.
  - It correctly finds and prints the minimum total cost among all possible starting rows.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and efficiently calculates the minimum total cost of placing supports for `k` consecutive bridges.

**Correctness: True**
