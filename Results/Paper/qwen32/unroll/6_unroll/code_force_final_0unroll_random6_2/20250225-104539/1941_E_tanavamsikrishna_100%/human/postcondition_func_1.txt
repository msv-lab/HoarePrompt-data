The function `func_2` calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to build bridges over a series of `k` consecutive rows in a grid. The grid is defined by `n` rows and `m` columns, with each row represented as a list of integers. The integers in each row represent the cost of building bridges at each position, except for the first and last integers which are always 0. The parameter `d` specifies the maximum distance between supports. The function evaluates all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each set, then outputs the minimum of these total costs.
