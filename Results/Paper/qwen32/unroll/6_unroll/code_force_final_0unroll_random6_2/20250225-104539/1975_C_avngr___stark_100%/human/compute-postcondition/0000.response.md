Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 500 inclusive. The other variables (`n`, `a`) and their conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
