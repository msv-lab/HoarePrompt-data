You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

        print(max)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is the maximum value among the medians of all contiguous subarrays of length 3 in the list `a`. If `n` is 2, the output is the minimum value in the list `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `a` are re-assigned for each test case but are not retained after the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum possible value that can fill the entire array after repeatedly applying the described operation. The key point is to identify the maximum median value that can be obtained from any subarray of length 3 or more (since the median of a subarray of length 1 or 2 is not useful for maximizing the final value).

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
3. If the length of the array is 2, it simply prints the minimum of the two elements.
4. Otherwise, it iterates through the array, looking at every subarray of length 3.
5. For each subarray, it sorts the subarray and checks if the median (which is the middle element of the sorted subarray) is greater than the current maximum median found.
6. It updates the maximum median if a larger median is found.
7. Finally, it prints the maximum median found for that test case.

### Correctness Check

The program is attempting to find the maximum median value of any subarray of length 3 or more. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:

- The program only considers subarrays of length 3. It does not consider subarrays of length 4 or more, which could potentially have a larger median.
- The problem statement does not specify that the maximum median can only be found in subarrays of length 3. In fact, the example provided in the problem statement uses subarrays of length 2, 3, and 5 to achieve the final result.

### Conclusion

Given that the program only considers subarrays of length 3, it might not find the maximum possible median value that can be used to fill the entire array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
