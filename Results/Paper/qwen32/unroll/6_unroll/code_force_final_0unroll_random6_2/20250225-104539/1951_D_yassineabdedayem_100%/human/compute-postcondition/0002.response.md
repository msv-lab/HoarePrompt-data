Output State: **The output state consists of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, each followed by additional output lines based on the conditions evaluated within the loop. For each test case, if n equals k, the output is 'YES', 1, and 1. If n + 2 is greater than k * 2, the output is 'YES', 2, n - k + 1, and 1. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'. The values of n, k, and t remain unchanged in the initial state, and t iterations of the loop have been executed.**
