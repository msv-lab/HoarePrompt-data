Let's systematically evaluate the given program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, going from stall 1 to stall 60, buying as many jewels as possible at each stall.

### Provided Program Analysis

The current implementation handles two specific cases:
1. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - If the number of coins Alice has (`n`) is equal to the number of jewels she wants to buy (`k`), Bob can set up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - This case is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - This condition is not clearly derived from the problem description and seems to be an attempt to handle some scenarios where `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The program suggests setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` and another with a price of 1. However, this logic does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all scenarios.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds (10 + 2 > 4 * 2). The program suggests setting prices as `7` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel at the first stall (spending 7 coins) and 3 jewels at the second stall (spending 3 coins), totaling 4 jewels. However, this is a specific example, and the logic does not cover all cases where `n + 2 > k * 2` would lead to exactly `k` jewels being bought.

3. **Default Case:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program outputs "NO".
   - This is not a correct approach because there are many other valid ways to set up the stalls that the program does not consider.

### Function Summary Recap
The function summary indicates that the function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. It determines if it's possible to satisfy certain conditions and prints 'YES' followed by specific values if the conditions are met, or 'NO' if they are not. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged after processing each test case.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program does not handle all possible scenarios where it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically:
- The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is not a reliable way to determine if Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
- The program does not consider more general strategies, such as using the binary representation of `k` to determine the stall prices. This strategy involves setting up stalls with prices corresponding to the powers of 2, which is a valid approach as mentioned in the problem description.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program is not correct for all possible inputs. It fails to cover many valid scenarios where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
