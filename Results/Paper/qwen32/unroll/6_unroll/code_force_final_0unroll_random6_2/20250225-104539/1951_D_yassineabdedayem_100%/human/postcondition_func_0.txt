The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to satisfy certain conditions and prints 'YES' followed by specific values if the conditions are met, or 'NO' if they are not. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged after processing each test case.
