#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))

    #State: the printed values of `c` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the number of times the smallest two unique elements in the list are not consecutive in their order of appearance.
