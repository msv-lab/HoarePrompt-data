The loop head in the provided for loop is `_ range(int(input()))`. The only variable that can be directly adjusted according to the loop head is the value obtained from `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. 

Given the problem description, `t` is the number of test cases and it is provided as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input.

The state before the loop starts should ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that allows the loop to execute the required number of times. Since `t` is already defined as the number of test cases and it is within the valid range, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `int(input())` returns `t`**.

This state ensures that the loop will execute `t` times as intended by the problem description.
