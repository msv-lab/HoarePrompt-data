### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences such that the sum of penalties of the subsequences is minimized. The penalty of a subsequence is defined as the number of increasing pairs in the subsequence.

The provided program, however, does not correctly implement the logic to achieve this. Instead, it calculates something different: the number of times the smallest two unique elements in the list are not consecutive in their order of appearance, which does not directly correlate to minimizing the penalty of two subsequences.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to infinity, and `c` is initialized to 0.
2. **Loop through the list**: For each element in the list:
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, swap `a` and `b`.
   - If the current element is less than or equal to `a`, update `a` to the current element.
   - If the current element is less than or equal to `b` (and greater than `a`), update `b` to the current element.
   - If the current element is greater than both `a` and `b`, update `a` to the current element and increment `c`.

The variable `c` is incremented when the current element is greater than both `a` and `b`. This incrementation does not relate to the optimal splitting of the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty as defined in the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, one possible approach is to:
- Sort the array and then split it into two parts in such a way that the number of increasing pairs in each part is minimized.
- Alternatively, use dynamic programming or greedy algorithms to find the optimal split.

Given that the provided program does not implement the correct logic, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
