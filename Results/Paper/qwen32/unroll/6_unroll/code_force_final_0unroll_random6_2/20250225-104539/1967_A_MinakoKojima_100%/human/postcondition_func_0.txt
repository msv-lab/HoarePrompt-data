The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`, and prints this result. The final state of the program is that it has printed the result for each test case.
