The function `solve()` does not take any direct input parameters. Instead, it reads input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of array `a`. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
