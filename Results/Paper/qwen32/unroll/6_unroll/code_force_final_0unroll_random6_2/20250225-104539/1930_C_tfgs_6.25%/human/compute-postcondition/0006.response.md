The code snippet `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. This affects the order of elements in `a`, but does not change the values of the elements themselves. The `n` variable, representing the length of the array `a`, remains unchanged. The `counter` object, which counts the occurrences of each element in the original list `a`, is also not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is the same input integer representing the original length of array `a`; `a` is a sorted list in descending order, where each element at index `i` is the original value at that index plus `i + 1`, with duplicates removed; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the original list `a`.**
