To determine what will be printed when the `print(*ans)` statement executes, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables and the list `ans` are constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: This is the original length of the array `a`.
2. **`a`**: This is a sorted list in descending order where each element at index `i` is the original value at that index plus `i + 1`, with duplicates removed.
3. **`counter`**: This is a Counter object that likely keeps track of the counts of elements in `a` after some processing.
4. **`cnt`**: This is the number of duplicates removed minus the number of elements added to `ans` that were not originally in `a`.
5. **`ans`**: This is a list containing all elements from `a` and `cnt` additional elements, each one less than the previous one.

### Understanding `ans`:
- The list `ans` starts with all elements from the list `a`.
- Then, `cnt` additional elements are added to `ans`. These elements are each one less than the previous one.

### Example Construction of `ans`:
Let's assume an example to make this clearer:
- Suppose `n = 5` and the original array `a` before modification was `[5, 4, 4, 3, 2]`.
- After modification, `a` becomes `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2]` (each element plus its index + 1) and duplicates are removed, so `a` is `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2]`.
- Suppose `cnt = 3`, meaning 3 additional elements are added to `ans` that are each one less than the previous one.
- The additional elements would be `[1, 0, -1]` (starting from the last element of `a` which is `2` and decrementing by 1 each time).

Thus, `ans` would be `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1]`.

### General Description:
- `ans` starts with all elements from `a`.
- Then `cnt` additional elements are added, each one less than the previous one, starting from the last element of `a`.

### Output:
Given the above explanation, the output will be the contents of the list `ans` as constructed.

Output: **the elements of `a` followed by `cnt` additional elements, each one less than the previous one (starting from the last element of `a`)**

To make it more precise without specific values:
Output: **[elements of `a`], [last element of `a` - 1], [last element of `a` - 2], ..., [last element of `a` - cnt] (where `a` is the modified and deduplicated list and `cnt` is the number of additional elements)**
