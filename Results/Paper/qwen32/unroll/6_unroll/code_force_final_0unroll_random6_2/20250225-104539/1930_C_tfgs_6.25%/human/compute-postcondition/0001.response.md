The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the initial state of `a` as a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is overwritten by the new list of integers provided through the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a`, and `a` is a new list of integers provided through the input.**
