### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Modify the Array**: For each element in the array `a`, add its 1-based index to it. This step is correctly implemented in the line `a[i] += i + 1`.

2. **Remove Duplicates and Sort**: Convert the modified array to a set to remove duplicates, then back to a list and sort it in descending order. This step is correctly implemented in the lines `counter = Counter(a)`, `a = list(set(a))`, and `a.sort(reverse=True)`.

3. **Construct the Result Array `ans`**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list `a` and for each element, add the necessary intermediate values to `ans` to fill the gaps between consecutive elements. This step is correctly implemented in the nested loop and the calculations within it.
   - After the loop, if there are still remaining elements to add to `ans` to reach the original length `n`, add the necessary number of decremented values from the last element in `ans`. This step is correctly implemented in the final loop `for _ in range(cnt): ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)`.

4. **Output the Result**: Print the elements of the final array `ans`.

Let's analyze the provided example cases:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - After modification: `3 2`
   - After removing duplicates and sorting: `3 2`
   - No gaps to fill, so `ans` is `3 2`
   - Output: `3 2` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000`
   - After modification: `2 101 1002 1000003 1000000004`
   - After removing duplicates and sorting: `1000000004 1000003 1002 101 2`
   - No gaps to fill, so `ans` is `1000000004 1000003 1002 101 2`
   - Output: `1000000004 1000003 1002 101 2` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `6 4 8`
   - After modification: `7 5 10`
   - After removing duplicates and sorting: `10 7 5`
   - No gaps to fill, so `ans` is `10 7 5`
   - Output: `10 7 5` (Correct)

Upon reviewing the code and the example cases, it is clear that the program correctly constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by following the problem's requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
