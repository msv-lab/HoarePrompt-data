The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It modifies each element of `a` by adding its 1-based index to it, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and then constructs a new list `ans` that includes all elements from the modified `a` and additional elements that fill gaps between consecutive elements in descending order, ensuring the total length of `ans` is `n`. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.
