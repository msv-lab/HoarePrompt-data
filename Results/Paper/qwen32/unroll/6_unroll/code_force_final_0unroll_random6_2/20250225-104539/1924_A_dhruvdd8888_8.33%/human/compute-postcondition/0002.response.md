The code snippet creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; the string `s` is the new input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet.**
