The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the length of the shortest contiguous subarray in `a` that contains all elements of the same value, or returns -1 if all elements in `a` are the same or if `n` is 1.
