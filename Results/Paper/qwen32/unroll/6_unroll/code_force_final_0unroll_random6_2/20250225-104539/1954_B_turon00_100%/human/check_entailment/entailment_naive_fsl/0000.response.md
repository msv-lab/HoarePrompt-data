Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the code is flawed, and it does not account for the correct conditions specified in the problem description.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
In this case, the array is beautiful because you can choose `i = 2` (0-based index) and replace `a[2]` with `a[1]` or `a[3]` to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` or `[1, 2, 3, 3, 1]`, which can further be reduced to non-beautiful arrays by removing one more element. However, the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful is just `1` (removing one `2`).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `-1` for this input, which is incorrect.

The issue in the program lies in the way it calculates `ans` and the conditions it checks. The program seems to be attempting to find the longest contiguous segment of identical elements and then removing that segment, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
