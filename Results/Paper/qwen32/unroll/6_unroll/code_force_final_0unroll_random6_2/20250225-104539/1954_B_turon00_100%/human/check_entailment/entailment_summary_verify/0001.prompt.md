You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        tmp = a[0]
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        if n == 1 or ans == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the length of the shortest contiguous subarray in `a` that contains all elements of the same value, or returns -1 if all elements in `a` are the same or if `n` is 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation: choosing an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`) such that `a[i - 1] = a[i + 1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i - 1]`.

The program should output:
- The minimum number of elements to remove if it's possible to make the array not beautiful.
- `-1` if it's impossible to make the array not beautiful.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and counting consecutive identical elements. It keeps track of the length of the longest sequence of identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0.
4. It iterates through the array:
   - If the current element is the same as `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element is different from `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, then resets `cnt` to 1 and updates `tmp` to the current element.
5. After the loop, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and the last `cnt` value.
6. If the array length `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, it prints `-1` (indicating the array cannot be made not beautiful).
7. Otherwise, it prints `ans` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

### Correctness Analysis:
The program's logic has a fundamental flaw. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. Here are some issues:
- The program only considers contiguous sequences of identical elements, which is insufficient for determining if the array can be made not beautiful.
- The program does not account for the specific operation allowed (replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`), which can affect non-contiguous sequences.
- The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence of identical elements, which is not always the case.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]`. The program would incorrectly determine that the longest sequence of identical elements is 3 (the sequence of 1s), and thus output 3. However, removing just one element (the 3) would make the array not beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
