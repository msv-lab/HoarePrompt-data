Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of a contiguous subarray that contains all elements of the same value. The idea is that if we remove all elements in this subarray, the resulting array will no longer be beautiful. The program iterates through the array and counts the length of contiguous segments of the same value. It keeps track of the minimum length of such segments. If the entire array is made up of the same value or if the array has only one element, it returns -1, as it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful in these cases.

However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the operation described in the problem statement, which involves replacing an element with the same value as its neighbors. The program only considers contiguous segments of the same value and does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements that are not part of the longest contiguous segment of the same value.

For example, consider the test case:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program would output 3, as the shortest contiguous subarray of the same value is `5`. However, the correct answer is also 3, but it can be achieved by removing the first three `3`s, making the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful. The program does not consider this possibility.

The program's logic is not sufficient to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
