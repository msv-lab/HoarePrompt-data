Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0, `visited` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The variable `visited` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The other variables (`start_pos`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`) remain unchanged.
