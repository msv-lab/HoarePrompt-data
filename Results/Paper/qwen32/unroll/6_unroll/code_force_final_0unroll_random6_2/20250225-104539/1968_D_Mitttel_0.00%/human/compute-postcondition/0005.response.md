To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `steps < k` is true. The variables involved in this condition are `steps` and `k`.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n
- `score` is 0
- `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`
- `steps` is 0
- `visited` is an empty dictionary
- `cycle_start` is -1

The condition `steps < k` can be satisfied by ensuring that `k` is greater than `steps`. Since `steps` is initially 0, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0, `visited` is an empty dictionary, `cycle_start` is -1, `k` must be greater than 0**
