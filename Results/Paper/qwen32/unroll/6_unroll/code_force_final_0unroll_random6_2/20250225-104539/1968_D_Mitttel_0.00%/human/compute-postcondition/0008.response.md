Output State: **The program returns 'Draw'**

In this scenario, the program is designed to return the string 'Draw' directly, without any further calculations or conditions being applied. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `bodya_score`, and `sasha_score` do not affect the return statement. The only information provided about the scores is that `bodya_score` is less than or equal to `sasha_score`, and `sasha_score` is not greater than `bodya_score`, which implies that both scores are equal. However, the return statement explicitly returns 'Draw', so this is the final output state.
