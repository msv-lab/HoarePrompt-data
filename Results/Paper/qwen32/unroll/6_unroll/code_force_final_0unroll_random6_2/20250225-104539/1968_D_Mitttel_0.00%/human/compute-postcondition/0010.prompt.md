You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array a, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers representing the array a.
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS)
    if (bodya_score > sasha_score) :
        return 'Bodya'
        #The program returns 'Bodya'
    else :
        if (sasha_score > bodya_score) :
            return 'Sasha'
            #The program returns 'Sasha'
        else :
            return 'Draw'
            #The program returns 'Draw'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array `a`), `k` (a positive integer representing the duration of the game), `PB` (a positive integer representing Bodya's starting position), `PS` (a positive integer representing Sasha's starting position), `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`). The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya wins the game, 'Sasha' if Sasha wins the game, and 'Draw' if the game ends in a draw after `k` moves.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Bodya'

Case_2: The program returns 'Sasha'

Case_3: The program returns 'Draw'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
