Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. The function returns a value indicating the result of some comparison or operation on `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.**
