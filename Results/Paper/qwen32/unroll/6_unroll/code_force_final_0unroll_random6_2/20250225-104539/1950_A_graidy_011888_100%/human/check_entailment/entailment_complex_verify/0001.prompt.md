You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; n is an input integer. The loop has finished executing all n iterations, and for each iteration, it has printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions provided. The values of t, a, b, c, and n remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given Python program correctly implements the solution for the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and how it matches the problem requirements:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, corresponding to each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
4. It checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`. If true, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the digits do not form a stair, it checks if they form a peak using the condition `a < b and b > c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The conditions used in the program directly correspond to the definitions of a "stair" and a "peak" provided in the problem statement. The program handles all possible combinations of the three digits and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
