You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; n is an input integer. The loop has finished executing all n iterations, and for each iteration, it has printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions provided. The values of t, a, b, c, and n remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **STAIR Condition (a < b < c):** The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if true. This condition is correctly implemented.
2. **PEAK Condition (a < b > c):** The program checks if `a < b and b > c` and prints "PEAK" if true. This condition is also correctly implemented.
3. **NONE Condition:** If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback condition.

The program processes multiple test cases as specified, reading the number of test cases first and then iterating through each test case to determine and print the appropriate result. There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle according to the given problem description.
