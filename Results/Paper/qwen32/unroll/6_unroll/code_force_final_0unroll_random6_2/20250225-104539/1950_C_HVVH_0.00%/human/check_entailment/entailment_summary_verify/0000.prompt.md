You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of time entries, followed by `n` time strings in the format "hh:mm" in 24-hour format. It converts each time to the 12-hour format with AM/PM and prints the result. The original input values remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in handling the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, the handling of the hour `12` in both AM and PM is incorrect.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'PM'
    if h == 12:
        day = 'AM'
```

The issue arises in the `else` block. When `h` is `12`, the program incorrectly sets the day to `PM` before checking if `h` is `12`. This results in the hour `12` being incorrectly marked as `PM` instead of `AM`.

Here is a counterexample demonstrating the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
12:00
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12:00 PM
```

**Actual Output:**
```
12:00 AM
```

To fix this, the code should be modified to correctly handle the hour `12` in both AM and PM:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

With this modification, the program should correctly handle all edge cases, including `00:00`, `12:00`, and any other valid 24-hour time.
