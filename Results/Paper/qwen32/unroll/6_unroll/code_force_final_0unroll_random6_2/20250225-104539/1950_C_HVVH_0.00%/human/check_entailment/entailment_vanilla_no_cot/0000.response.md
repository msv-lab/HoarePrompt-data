Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in handling the conversion of 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets the day to 'PM' when `h` is 12, which should be 'AM'. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the condition `elif h == 12` is added to correctly set the day to 'PM' when the hour is 12.
