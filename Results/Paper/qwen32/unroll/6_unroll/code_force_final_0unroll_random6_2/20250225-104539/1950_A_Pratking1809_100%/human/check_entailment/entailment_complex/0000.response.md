Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The conditions used in the if-elif-else statement correctly match the definitions of "STAIR" and "PEAK" as per the problem statement. There are no logical errors in the program, and it handles all possible inputs within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
