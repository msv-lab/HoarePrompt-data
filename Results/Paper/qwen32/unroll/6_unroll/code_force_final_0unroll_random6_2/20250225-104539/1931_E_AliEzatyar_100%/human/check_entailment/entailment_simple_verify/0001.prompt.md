You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the rules and conditions of the game described.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of integers in the list), `m` (the parameter for Sasha's win condition), and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Counting Digits and Leading Zeros:**
   - The variable `total_digits` accumulates the total number of digits in all numbers.
   - The list `zeros` stores the number of leading zeros that can be removed if Anna reverses a number. This is calculated using the function `func_1(num)`, which counts the trailing zeros in the number's string representation (not leading zeros as the name might suggest).

3. **Sorting and Calculating `subtract_zero`:**
   - The list `zeros` is sorted in descending order.
   - `subtract_zero` is calculated by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list. This step seems to be an attempt to simulate Sasha's moves, but it is not clear how it relates to the actual game mechanics.

4. **Win Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, it concludes that Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues and Flaws:

- **Incorrect Understanding of Leading Zeros:**
  - The function `func_1` counts trailing zeros, not leading zeros. This is incorrect because reversing a number removes leading zeros, not trailing ones.
  
- **Incorrect Simulation of Moves:**
  - The logic for calculating `subtract_zero` does not accurately simulate the game. It does not consider the optimal moves for either player. The program does not simulate Anna's and Sasha's turns and their strategic choices.
  
- **Misinterpretation of Win Condition:**
  - The win condition check is based on a flawed calculation. It does not correctly reflect the final number's value after all possible moves.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. It makes incorrect assumptions about leading zeros and does not properly simulate the strategic moves of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
