Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner based on the rules of the game. The logic for calculating the number of leading zeros and determining the winner is flawed.

Here are some key issues:
1. The function `func_1` calculates the number of trailing zeros, not leading zeros. The problem statement requires reversing the digits of the numbers, and leading zeros are removed after reversing. However, the program is checking for trailing zeros.
2. The program does not correctly simulate the game. It does not consider the optimal moves for both players. For example, Sasha's moves involve concatenating two numbers, which can significantly change the total number of digits.
3. The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` does not correctly reflect the game's ending condition. The game ends when there is only one number left, and Sasha wins if that number is at least \(10^m\).

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to simulate the game or use a strategy that considers the optimal moves for both players. The current program does not do that and thus is incorrect.
