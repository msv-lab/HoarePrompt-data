Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the input integer minus 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `mx` has been set to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, and `subseq_lens`) retain their initial values.
