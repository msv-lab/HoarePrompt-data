You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, given that a slime can only eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger than that neighbor. If a slime cannot be eaten, we should report -1 for that slime.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break down the logic of each function and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, x)`

This function uses `bisect_left` to find the first index in the list `a` where the value is not less than `x`. If the value at the found index is equal to `x`, it returns the index + 1 (presumably to convert from 0-based to 1-based indexing). Otherwise, it returns the index.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`

This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `left` is initialized with a single element `0` and will eventually store cumulative sums of the slime sizes.
   - `last` is initialized with `-1` and will store the last index where the slime size changed.
   - `ans` is initialized with `-1` for all slimes, indicating that initially, it's assumed that no slime can be eaten.

2. **Building `last` and `left`**:
   - The `last` array is built such that `last[i]` contains the last index where the slime size changed up to the i-th slime.
   - The `left` array is built such that `left[i]` contains the cumulative sum of slime sizes up to the i-th slime.

3. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - For each slime `i` starting from the second slime:
     - If the current slime is smaller than the previous slime, it can be eaten immediately, so `ans[i]` is set to `1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates a value `x` which is the cumulative sum up to the previous slime minus the current slime size minus one. This value `x` is used to find the earliest point in the cumulative sum where the current slime could potentially eat a smaller neighbor.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the index in `left` where `x` can be inserted without violating the order.
     - It compares this index with the last index where the slime size changed (`last[i - 1]`) and selects the smaller one.
     - If the selected index is valid, it calculates the time it takes for the current slime to be eaten and stores it in `ans[i]`.

### Correctness Evaluation

After analyzing the logic of the program, we can see that it attempts to solve the problem using a combination of cumulative sums and binary search, but there are several issues:

1. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The cumulative sum array `left` is used to find the earliest point where a slime could potentially eat a smaller neighbor. However, the logic for calculating `x` and using `func_1` to find the index is not correct for the problem's requirements. The program does not correctly account for the fact that a slime can only eat its immediate neighbors and must be strictly larger than them.

2. **Logic for Eating Neighbors**: The program does not correctly simulate the process of slimes eating their neighbors. It does not handle the dynamic nature of the problem where the list of slimes changes as slimes are eaten.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when all slimes are of the same size or when the slimes are in a strictly increasing or decreasing order.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for determining when a slime can eat another slime and calculating the minimum number of seconds is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
