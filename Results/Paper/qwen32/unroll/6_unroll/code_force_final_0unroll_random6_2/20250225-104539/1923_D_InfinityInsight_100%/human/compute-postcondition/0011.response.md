Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes, where `n` is equal to the length of the list `a` and `n` is at least 1. The function returns a list `ans` of the same length as `a`, where each element in `ans` is determined based on specific conditions related to the sizes of the slimes. The return value for the provided example input is `[-1, 1, 3, 2, 3]`.**
