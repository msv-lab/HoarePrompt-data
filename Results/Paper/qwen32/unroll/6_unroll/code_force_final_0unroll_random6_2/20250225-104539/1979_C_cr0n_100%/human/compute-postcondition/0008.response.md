The provided `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print(-1)
```

The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement is independent of these variables and conditions. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `N`: An integer value provided by user input.
   - `vals`: A list of integers where each integer \( k_i \) (2 <= \( k_i \) <= 20) is a multiplier for the i-th outcome, and the length of `vals` is equal to `N`.
   - `den`: The product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`, and it is less than or equal to 0.
   - `vprod`: A list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(-1)` does not depend on the values of `N`, `vals`, `den`, or `vprod`. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

Given the above, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
