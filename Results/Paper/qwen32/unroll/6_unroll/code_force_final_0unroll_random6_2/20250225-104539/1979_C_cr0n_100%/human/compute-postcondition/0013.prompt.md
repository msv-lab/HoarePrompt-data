You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes such that 1 <= N <= 50, vals is a list of integers where each integer k_i represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of vals is equal to N.
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: N is the integer value provided by the user input, vals is a list of integers where each integer k_i represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of vals is equal to N, with vals now holding the specific integers read from the input; den is the product of all elements in vals.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `N` is the integer value provided by the user input, `vals` is a list of integers where each integer \( k_i \) represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that \( 2 \leq k_i \leq 20 \), and the length of `vals` is equal to `N`, with `vals` now holding the specific integers read from the input; `den` is the product of all elements in `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`; `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`; `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: vprod (where vprod is a list of integers calculated as den // r for each r in vals)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` representing the number of outcomes, where 1 <= N <= 50, and a list `vals` of integers where each integer `k_i` represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome, with 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of `vals` equal to `N`. The function returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
