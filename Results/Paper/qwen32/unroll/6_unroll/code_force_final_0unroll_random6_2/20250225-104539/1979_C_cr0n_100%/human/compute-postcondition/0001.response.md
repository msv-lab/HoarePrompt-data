The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component into an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. Given the initial state where `N` is the integer value provided by the user input and `vals` is initially a list of integers with specific properties, the code modifies `vals` to be the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the user input, `vals` is a list of integers where each integer k_i represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of vals is equal to N, with `vals` now holding the specific integers read from the input.**
