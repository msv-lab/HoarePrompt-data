The code `N = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `N`. This means `N` will now hold the specific integer value provided by the user input, which represents the number of outcomes.

Since `vals` is not modified or redefined in the provided code snippet, it retains its initial state as described in the initial conditions.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value provided by the user input, `vals` is a list of integers where each integer k_i represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome such that 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of vals is equal to N.**
