Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze why:

The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to distribute the bets. It then calculates the bets based on the LCM divided by each multiplier and adjusts the total to ensure it's positive. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each winning outcome.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
Since all multipliers are 2, any valid distribution of bets such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome is acceptable. For example:
```
1 1 1
```
This is valid because the total bet is 3, and the return for each winning outcome is 4.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will calculate the LCM of 2, 2, and 2 which is 2. Then it will calculate the bets as 1, 1, 1, and the total bet will be 3. The remaining value `den` will be 2 - (1 + 1 + 1) = -2, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, the program will output `-1`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
