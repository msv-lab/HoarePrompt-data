To determine the output state, we need to analyze the loop and how the variable `ans` evolves through each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: `ans` starts as a set containing the value `x` returned by `func_3()`.
2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `m` times. In each iteration:
   - `r, c = func_1().split()`: This line splits the output of `func_1()` into two parts, `r` and `c`. `r` is converted to an integer.
   - `temp = set()`: A temporary set `temp` is initialized to store new values.
   - The inner loop iterates over each element `q` in `ans`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - After the inner loop, `ans` is updated to be equal to `temp`.

### Understanding the Transformation:
- Each iteration of the loop modifies `ans` based on the values of `r` and `c` from `func_1()`.
- The operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` transform the elements of `ans` in a modular arithmetic fashion.
- The character `c` determines which transformations are applied:
  - `'0'`: Only addition `(q + r) % n` is applied.
  - `'1'`: Only subtraction `(q - r) % n` is applied.
  - `'?'`: Both addition and subtraction are applied.

### Output State:
After `m` iterations, `ans` will contain all the transformed values based on the operations specified by `r` and `c` from each call to `func_1()`.

**Output State:** **`ans` is a set containing all the values generated by applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x`, for each of the `m` iterations, based on the values of `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**

Given the problem's constraints and the operations performed, the output state is described as:

Output State: **`ans` is a set of values generated by applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, based on `r` and `c` from `func_1()`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
