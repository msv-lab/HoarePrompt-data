### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_2()`, which internally calls `func_1()` to read the next line of input and converts it to an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which also relies on `func_1()` to read the next line of input, splits it into space-separated strings, and converts each to an integer.
   - The program then reads `m` lines, each containing a distance `r` and a direction `c`, where `r` is an integer and `c` is a character ('0', '1', or '?').

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The initial set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, the program updates the set `ans` by considering both possible directions (clockwise and counterclockwise) if the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), or just the specified direction if it is known (`c == '0'` or `c == '1'`).
   - The transformation `(q + r) % n` is used for a clockwise throw, and `(q - r) % n` is used for a counterclockwise throw.
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if necessary. This is because the modulo operation can result in `0` when the actual position is `n`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of unique players who could have the ball after `m` throws (`len(ans)`).
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Verification Against Execution States:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 6`, `m = 3`, `x = 2`
  - Throws: `2 ?`, `2 ?`, `2 ?`
  - Possible final positions: `2, 4, 6`
  - Output: `3\n2 4 6`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - `n = 12`, `m = 1`, `x = 2`
  - Throws: `3 1`
  - Final position: `11`
  - Output: `1\n11`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - `n = 10`, `m = 7`, `x = 4`
  - Throws: `2 ?`, `9 1`, `4 ?`, `7 0`, `2 0`, `8 1`, `5 ?`
  - Possible final positions: `3, 5, 7, 9`
  - Output: `4\n3 5 7 9`

- **Test Case 4**:
  - `n = 5`, `m = 3`, `x = 1`
  - Throws: `4 0`, `4 ?`, `1 ?`
  - Possible final positions: `2, 3, 5`
  - Output: `3\n2 3 5`

- **Test Case 5**:
  - `n = 4`, `m = 1`, `x = 1`
  - Throws: `2 ?`
  - Possible final position: `3`
  - Output: `1\n3`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes the input and calculates the possible final positions of the ball after `m` throws, considering all possible directions for throws where the direction is unknown. The output matches the expected results for the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
