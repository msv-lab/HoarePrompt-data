To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, we need to understand the contents of the set `ans` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ans` Set**: This set is generated by repeatedly applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations.
2. **Transformations**:
   - `(q + r) % n`
   - `(q - r) % n`
3. **Special Condition**:
   - If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` includes the value `n` and excludes the value `0`.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, then `0` remains not in `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The set `ans` is generated through a series of transformations, which means it will contain unique values resulting from these transformations.
- The length of `ans` will be the number of unique values generated by these transformations.
- The special condition about `0` and `n` only affects the presence of these two values within `ans`.

### Output:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of unique values in the set `ans`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `q`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `len(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the size of the set `ans`.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of unique values in the set `ans` generated by the transformations)**
