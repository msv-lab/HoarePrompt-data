Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets. The main issue lies in the way it calculates the cost and the assumption made about the number of tickets to buy each day.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem and the issues in the code:

1. **Sorting and Greedy Approach**:
   - The code sorts the prices and then assumes that buying tickets on the cheapest days is the optimal strategy. However, this greedy approach does not consider the cumulative effect of increasing prices after each purchase.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation in the code is incorrect. It does not properly account for the increasing prices after each purchase. Specifically:
     - The code calculates the cost as if it buys `m` tickets on the cheapest days and then calculates the additional cost based on the number of days and the number of tickets bought. However, this does not correctly simulate the scenario where prices increase after each purchase.
     - The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the prices increase after each purchase, and the additional cost is not correctly calculated.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the number of tickets `k` is less than `m`, the code might still try to buy `m` tickets on the first day, which is incorrect.
   - The code also does not handle cases where the number of tickets `k` is exactly divisible by `m` or when `k` is not divisible by `m`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the code:

**Counterexample**:
```
Input:
1
5 2 6
1 3 5 7 9

Expected Output:
21

Explanation:
One optimal way to buy 6 tickets is:
- Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 2 (prices become [3, 5, 7, 9]).
- Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 10 (prices become [5, 7, 9]).
- Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 18 (prices become [7, 9]).
Total cost = 2 + 10 + 18 = 30

However, the correct way is:
- Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 2 (prices become [3, 5, 7, 9]).
- Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 10 (prices become [5, 7, 9]).
- Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 12 (prices become [7, 9]).
Total cost = 2 + 10 + 12 = 24

The code will not produce the correct output for this case.

Given these issues, the code is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
