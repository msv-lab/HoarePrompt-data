Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the prices and then strategically purchasing tickets to minimize the total cost. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the program that make it incorrect.

1. **Sorting Prices**: The program sorts the prices in ascending order, which is a good start because we want to buy tickets at the lowest prices first. However, the logic for purchasing tickets after sorting is flawed.

2. **Calculating the Cost**: The program calculates the cost based on the assumption that we can buy up to `m` tickets each day, but it doesn't correctly account for the increase in ticket prices after each purchase. The formula used to calculate the cost is incorrect and doesn't reflect the problem's constraints accurately.

3. **Handling Remaining Tickets**: The program incorrectly handles the case where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day (`m`). The logic for handling the remaining tickets is flawed and doesn't correctly calculate the cost.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `m` is very large or when the number of tickets to be bought is equal to the number of days multiplied by the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to purchase the required number of tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
