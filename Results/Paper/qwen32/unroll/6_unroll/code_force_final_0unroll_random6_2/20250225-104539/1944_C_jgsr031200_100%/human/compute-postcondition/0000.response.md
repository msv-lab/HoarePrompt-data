The code initializes a list `freq` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This list is used to keep track of the frequency of elements in the array `arr`. The initial state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`; `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
