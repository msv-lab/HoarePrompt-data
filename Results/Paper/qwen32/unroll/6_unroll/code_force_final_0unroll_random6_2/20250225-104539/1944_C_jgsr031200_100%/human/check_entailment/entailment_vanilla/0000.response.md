Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to remove elements from array `a` and appending elements to array `c`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

### Strategy:
- Alice and Bob play optimally.
- Alice will try to add numbers that help maximize the MEX.
- Bob will try to add numbers that help minimize the MEX.

### Key Observations:
- If a number appears more than once in `a`, it can be ignored for the MEX calculation because it won't affect the smallest missing number.
- The MEX is determined by the smallest number that is not present in `c` after all elements have been moved from `a` to `c`.
- Alice and Bob will play such that the final MEX is determined by the smallest number that appears an odd number of times or the smallest number that does not appear at all.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - The program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through `arr` and updates the frequency count.

3. **Determining MEX**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cou` to count unique numbers (numbers that appear exactly once).
   - It iterates through the frequency array.
   - If a number appears more than once (`freq[i] >= 2`), it skips it.
   - If a number appears exactly once (`freq[i] == 1`), it increments the `cou` counter.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if a number does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`), it prints the current number `i` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly counts the frequency of each number.
- It correctly identifies the smallest number that appears exactly once or does not appear at all, which is the MEX.
- The logic to determine the MEX is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally.

**Correctness: True**
