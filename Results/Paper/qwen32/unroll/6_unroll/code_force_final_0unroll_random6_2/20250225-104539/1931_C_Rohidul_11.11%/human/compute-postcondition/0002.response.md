Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is the number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 10,000), and for each test case, it accepts `n` (an integer between 1 and 200,000) and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided list `a`.**
