You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

        print(*ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sequence of integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) must sum to \( k \).
2. **Maximize 1s in Binary OR**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

### Solution Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
2. **Binary Representation of \( k \)**: It finds the binary representation of \( k \) and stores the positions of the bits that are set to 1 in the list `arr`.
3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence.
   - It then iterates over the positions in `arr` and for each position, it appends \( 2^{\text{position}} \) to `ans` until it has \( n-1 \) elements.
   - The last element is set to \( k \) minus the sum of the elements already in `ans`.
   - If `ans` has fewer than \( n \) elements, it pads it with zeros.
4. **Output**: It prints the sequence for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Sum Condition**: The program ensures that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals \( k \). This is done by setting the last element to \( k \) minus the sum of the other elements.
- **Maximizing 1s in Binary OR**: The program maximizes the number of 1s in the binary OR by setting the positions of 1s in the binary representation of \( k \) to be the elements of the sequence. This is because each \( 2^{\text{position}} \) will have a 1 in the binary representation at the corresponding position, and the bitwise OR will have 1s in all positions where any of the elements have a 1.

However, there is a potential issue in the program that could lead to incorrect results:
- **Handling of \( n \)**: If \( n \) is less than the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( k \), the program will not correctly handle this case. Specifically, it might not distribute the sum \( k \) across \( n \) elements properly, and it might not ensure that the sequence has exactly \( n \) elements.

### Example:
Let's consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 5`. The binary representation of 5 is `101`, so `arr` will be `[0, 2]`. The program will create a sequence `[1, 4]` which sums to 5 and has 2 elements, which is correct. However, if `n` were 3, the program would create a sequence `[1, 4, 0]` which sums to 5 but has 3 elements, but it could potentially be `[1, 2, 2]` which also sums to 5 and has 3 elements and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary OR.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when \( n \) is greater than the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( k \). Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct sequence for all possible inputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
