Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices), `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0.**

In plain terms: The variable `price_increase` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
