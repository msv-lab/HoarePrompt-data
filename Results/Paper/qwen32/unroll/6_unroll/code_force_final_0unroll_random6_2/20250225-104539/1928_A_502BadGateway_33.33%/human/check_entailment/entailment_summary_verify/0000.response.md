### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code systematically.

**Problem Recap:**
Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle. The key point is that the new rectangle should have different dimensions from the original rectangle. The function should determine if this is possible.

**Logic Analysis:**
- **Cutting Parallel to Side `a`:** If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a x (b/2)` each. These two rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2) x b`, which is different from the original `a x b` rectangle.
- **Cutting Parallel to Side `b`:** If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `(a/2) x b` each. These two rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `a x (b/2)`, which is different from the original `a x b` rectangle.

Thus, the condition for Bob to be able to form another rectangle is if either `a` or `b` is even.

**Code Analysis:**
The provided code only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if true, otherwise 'no'. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of cutting parallel to the side of length `a`.

The correct logic should check if either `a` or `b` is even. The corrected version of the code is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

**Function Summary:**
The function summary provided states that the function returns 'yes' if `b` is even and 'no' otherwise, which aligns with the incorrect logic in the provided code.

**Original Assessment:**
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even and does not consider the possibility of cutting parallel to the side of length `a`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, and it does not account for the possibility of cutting parallel to the side of length `a`. The correct condition should be if either `a` or `b` is even.
