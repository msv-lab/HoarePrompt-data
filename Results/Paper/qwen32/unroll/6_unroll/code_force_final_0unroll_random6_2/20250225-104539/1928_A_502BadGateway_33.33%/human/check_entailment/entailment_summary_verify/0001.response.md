### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even and does not consider the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd. The correct logic should be that a new rectangle can be formed if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even.

Here's a systematic evaluation of the program based on the function summary and the problem description:

1. **Function Summary:** The function `func_1(a, b)` returns 'yes' if `b` is even and 'no' otherwise. The value of `a` is not considered in the function's logic.

2. **Problem Description:** From the problem, we know that a new rectangle can be formed if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even. This is because:
   - If `a` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two parts of size `a/2 x b`, which can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `b x a/2`.
   - If `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two parts of size `a x b/2`, which can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `b/2 x a`.

3. **Code Evaluation:** The provided code only checks if `b` is even. This means it will incorrectly return 'no' for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd. For example, for the input `2 3`, the code will return 'no', but the correct answer should be 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two `1 x 3` rectangles and rearranged to form a `3 x 2` rectangle.

4. **Correct Logic:** The correct logic should be to check if either `a` or `b` is even:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
   ```

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided code is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**
