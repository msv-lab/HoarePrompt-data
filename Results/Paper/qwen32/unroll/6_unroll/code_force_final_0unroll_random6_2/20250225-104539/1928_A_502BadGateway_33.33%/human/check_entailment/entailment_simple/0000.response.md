### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting the original rectangle \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.

Let's analyze the provided solution:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if `b` is even. If `b` is even, it returns 'yes', otherwise it returns 'no'.

This solution assumes that the possibility of forming a different rectangle depends solely on whether `b` is even. However, this is not correct. The correct condition depends on whether either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

Here's the correct logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, then it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles of size `a \times (b/2)` or `(a/2) \times b` which are not possible because `a` and `b` are odd, and thus cannot be divided evenly.

Therefore, the correct condition should be:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, instead of checking if either `a` or `b` is even.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, instead of checking if either `a` or `b` is even.
Correctness: **False**
