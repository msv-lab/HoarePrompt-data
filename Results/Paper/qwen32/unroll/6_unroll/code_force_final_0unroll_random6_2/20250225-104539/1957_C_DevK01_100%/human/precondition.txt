The function `sol` is intended to take a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the size of the chessboard and an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of moves already played. Each test case is followed by `k` lines, each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i` (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing the coordinates of the i-th move made. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and that the provided moves are valid.
