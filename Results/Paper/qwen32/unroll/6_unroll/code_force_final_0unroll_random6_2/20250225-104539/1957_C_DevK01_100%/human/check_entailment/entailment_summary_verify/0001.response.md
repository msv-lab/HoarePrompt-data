Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a certain number of moves have been made, considering the rules of placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. The computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is on the diagonal.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the chessboard) and `k` (number of moves already made).
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the moves already made.

2. **Logic to Calculate Remaining Moves**:
   - For each move (r, c):
     - If `r != c`, both `r` and `c` are occupied, so `n -= 2`.
     - If `r == c`, only that row/column is occupied, so `n -= 1`.

3. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The function uses dynamic programming with the transition formula `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`.

### Function Summary

The function summary states that `func_1(n)` always returns the value 25, regardless of the input `n`. However, this is clearly incorrect based on the provided code and the problem's requirements.

### Verification

1. **DP Transition Formula**:
   - The provided DP transition formula `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` is correct for the problem. It accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board by considering the placement of the first rook and the subsequent configurations.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - The base cases `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1` are correct. There is one way to place rooks on a 0x0 board (doing nothing) and one way to place rooks on a 1x1 board (placing one rook in the only cell).

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The results are computed modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, which is correct.

### Challenge to the Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program correctly solves the problem. However, the function summary is incorrect, as `func_1(n)` does not always return 25. Instead, it computes the number of configurations based on the DP formula provided.

### Conclusion

The program is correct in its logic and implementation, given that the function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the number of configurations using the provided DP formula. The function summary is incorrect, but it does not affect the correctness of the program itself.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described, and the function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the number of configurations based on the given constraints and transition formula.
