The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, the number of moves, and the moves themselves. A correct function definition would be `def func_1(test_cases)`, where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of `k` moves. Each move is a tuple of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. The precondition is that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, for each test case `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= n`, and each move `(r_i, c_i)` satisfies `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
