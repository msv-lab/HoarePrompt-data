Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Modulo Operation Error**: The modulo operation is incorrectly written as `7 + 10 ** 9` instead of `10 ** 9 + 7`.

2. **Function Definition Placement**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError` in Python.

3. **Logic Error in `n` Adjustment**: The logic for adjusting `n` based on the moves is incorrect. The program currently subtracts 2 from `n` when `a != b` and 1 when `a == b`, but this does not correctly account for the number of available positions on the board.

4. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which is not appropriate for the problem. The number of configurations for a board of size `n` should be initialized correctly.

5. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition function in `dp` is incorrect. The number of configurations for placing rooks on an `n x n` board is given by the double factorial `(2n-1)!!`, which is not captured by the current transition function.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of configurations based on the remaining positions on the board after `k` moves, taking into account the mirroring rule and the constraints of the problem. The dynamic programming approach should be correctly initialized and the transition function should accurately reflect the problem's requirements.
