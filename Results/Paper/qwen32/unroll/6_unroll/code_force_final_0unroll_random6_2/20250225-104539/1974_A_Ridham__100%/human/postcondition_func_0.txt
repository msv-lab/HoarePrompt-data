The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. It calculates and prints the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all the applications for each test case.
