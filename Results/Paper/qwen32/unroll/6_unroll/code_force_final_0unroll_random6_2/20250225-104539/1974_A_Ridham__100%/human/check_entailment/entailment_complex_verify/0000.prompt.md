You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99), where x is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and y is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon.

    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: Each element of the `result` list (where `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case) will be printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. It calculates and prints the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all the applications for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

### Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases (`n`).
    - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`).

2. **Calculation of Space Requirements**:
    - It calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons as `space_x = x * 1`.
    - It calculates the total space required for 2x2 icons as `space_y = y * 4`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
    - If the number of 2x2 icons (`y`) is even, it calculates the number of screens required as `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
    - If `y` is odd, it calculates the number of screens required as `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
    - It calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Calculation for 1x1 Icons**:
    - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), it appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the extra space required for 1x1 icons as `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
    - It calculates the number of additional screens required for the extra space and appends the total screens required to the result.

### Potential Issues

Let's consider a few edge cases to see if the program handles them correctly:

1. **Case 1: No Icons (x = 0, y = 0)**:
    - The program correctly returns 0 screens.
    - This is handled by the condition `if space_x <= remaining_cells`.

2. **Case 2: Only 1x1 Icons (x > 0, y = 0)**:
    - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required.
    - For example, if `x = 15`, it requires `15 // 15 = 1` screen.
    - If `x = 16`, it requires `16 // 15 = 1` screen with some cells left over, but it still requires 1 screen.

3. **Case 3: Only 2x2 Icons (x = 0, y > 0)**:
    - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required.
    - For example, if `y = 2`, it requires `2 // 2 = 1` screen.
    - If `y = 3`, it requires `3 // 2 + 1 = 2` screens.

4. **Case 4: Mixed Icons (x > 0, y > 0)**:
    - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required.
    - For example, if `x = 7` and `y = 2`, it requires `2 // 2 = 1` screen for 2x2 icons, and `7` 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells of that screen.
    - If `x = 12` and `y = 4`, it requires `4 // 2 = 2` screens for 2x2 icons, and `12` 1x1 icons cannot fit in the remaining cells, so it requires an additional screen.

5. **Case 5: Maximum Icons (x = 99, y = 99)**:
    - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required.
    - For example, if `y = 99`, it requires `99 // 2 + 1 = 50` screens for 2x2 icons, and `99` 1x1 icons cannot fit in the remaining cells, so it requires additional screens.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, it seems that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for any given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

**Correctness: True**

The program handles all edge cases correctly and calculates the minimum number of screens required as per the problem description.
