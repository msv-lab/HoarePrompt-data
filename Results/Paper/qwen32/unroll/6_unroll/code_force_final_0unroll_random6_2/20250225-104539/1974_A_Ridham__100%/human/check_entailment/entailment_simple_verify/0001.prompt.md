You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program aims to determine the minimum number of screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read pairs of integers `x` and `y` for each test case.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as the total number of cells required for 1x1 icons, which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` is calculated as the total number of cells required for 2x2 icons, which is `y * 4`.

3. **Calculating Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by dividing `y` by 2. If `y` is odd, it adds 1 to account for the remaining 2x2 icon that cannot fit into a full pair.
   - This is done using the expression `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + (y % 2)`, which is equivalent to `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1 if y % 2 else y // 2`.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - After placing all 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - This is done by subtracting the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons (`space_y`) from the total cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons (`15 * screen_require_for_y`).

5. **Placing 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons.
   - If `space_x` (the total cells required for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells, and no additional screens are needed.
   - If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, it calculates the number of additional cells required (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`) and then determines the number of additional screens needed to accommodate these extra cells.
   - The number of additional screens is calculated by dividing `extra_space` by 15. If `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15, it adds 1 to account for the partial screen.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the result list and prints the results after processing all test cases.

**Correctness:**
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to place the icons based on the given constraints. It handles the cases where 2x2 icons are placed first and then checks if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
