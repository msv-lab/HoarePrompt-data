Precondition: **lst is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst is an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50. This list represents the array a for a single test case. The function will be called multiple times, once for each test case, with different lists. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^3.**
