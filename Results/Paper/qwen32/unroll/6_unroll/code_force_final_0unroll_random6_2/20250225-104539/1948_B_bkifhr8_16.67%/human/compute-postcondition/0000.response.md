The code snippet sorts the list `lst` and assigns the result to `sorted_lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged, and `sorted_lst` is a new list containing the same integers as `lst` but in non-decreasing order. The length of the list and the constraints on the integers within the list remain the same.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst is an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of sorted_lst is n, with integers in non-decreasing order.**
