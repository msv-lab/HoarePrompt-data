You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers, `lst`, where each integer is between 0 and 99, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. It returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine if it's possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `list1`.

2. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the list at the same position.
   - However, the logic only checks the immediate next element (`list1[p]`) and does not consider subsequent elements that might need to be split to maintain the sorted order.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the entire list will be sorted after a single pass. It might require multiple passes or a different strategy to ensure the list is fully sorted.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After attempting to transform the list, the program calls a function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, the program prints "Yes" or "No".

**Flaws in the Program:**
- The main flaw in the program is the logic used to transform the list. The program only checks the immediate next element and does not account for the need to repeatedly check and transform elements until the entire list is sorted.
- A more robust approach would involve repeatedly iterating over the list until no more transformations are needed, or using a different strategy to ensure the list is sorted.

**Conclusion:**
The program provided does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation. Therefore, it may produce incorrect results for certain test cases.
