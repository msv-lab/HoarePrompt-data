The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and this value will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 50. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.**
