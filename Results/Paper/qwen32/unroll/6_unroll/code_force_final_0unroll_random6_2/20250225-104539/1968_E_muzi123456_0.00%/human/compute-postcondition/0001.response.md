The `while t:` loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value. Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `t` is guaranteed to be non-zero and within the specified range. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
