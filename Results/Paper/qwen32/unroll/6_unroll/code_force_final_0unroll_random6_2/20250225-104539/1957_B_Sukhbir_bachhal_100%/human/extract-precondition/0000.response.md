Precondition: **The function `func_1` should actually be defined with two parameters `n` and `k` as per the problem description. Therefore, the correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, k):`. Given this, the precondition is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
