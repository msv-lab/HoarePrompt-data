You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)

        print(*p)
        
    #State: For each test case with input n, the output is a permutation p of length n where even indices are filled with decreasing values starting from n and odd indices are filled with increasing values starting from 1 + n % 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)).
- The output should be a valid permutation for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a permutation by:
1. Placing the largest numbers at even indices first, starting from the largest number \( n \) and decrementing by 2 each time.
2. Placing the smallest numbers at odd indices, starting from 1 (or 2 if \( n \) is odd) and incrementing by 2 each time.

Let's see if this approach ensures that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Even Indices**: The even indices are filled with the largest numbers in descending order. For example, for \( n = 4 \), the even indices will be filled with \( [4, 2] \).
2. **Odd Indices**: The odd indices are filled with the smallest numbers in ascending order, starting from 1 (or 2 if \( n \) is odd). For example, for \( n = 4 \), the odd indices will be filled with \( [1, 3] \).

Given this pattern, let's consider the divisibility condition:
- The largest numbers are placed at even indices, and the smallest numbers are placed at odd indices.
- Since the largest numbers are at even indices, they cannot divide the smaller numbers at odd indices.
- Similarly, the smallest numbers at odd indices cannot divide the larger numbers at even indices.

Thus, this pattern ensures that no two adjacent elements in the permutation \( p \) will have the property that one divides the other and the next element in \( p \) divides the next element in the other sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation for each test case that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, the program is correct.
