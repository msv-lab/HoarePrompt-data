Let's analyze the provided code and understand the output state after the loop executes for each test case.

### Code Analysis
1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, it constructs a permutation `p` of length `n`.
3. **First Inner Loop**:
   - Iterates over the even indices of the permutation `p` (0, 2, 4, ...).
   - Assigns values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2 (`n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ...).
4. **Second Inner Loop**:
   - Iterates over the odd indices of the permutation `p` (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - Assigns values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2 (`1 + n % 2`, `3 + n % 2`, `5 + n % 2`, ...).

### Output Explanation
- For even `n`, the permutation `p` will have the even indices filled with decreasing values from `n` and the odd indices filled with increasing values starting from `1`.
- For odd `n`, the permutation `p` will have the even indices filled with decreasing values from `n` and the odd indices filled with increasing values starting from `2`.

### Example
Let's consider a test case where `n = 5`:
- Even indices (0, 2, 4) will be filled with `5, 3, 1` respectively.
- Odd indices (1, 3) will be filled with `2, 4` respectively.
- The resulting permutation `p` will be `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

### Output State
The output state after all test cases are processed will be a series of permutations, each corresponding to the input `n` for that test case.

### Final Output State
Given the format, the output state for each test case is a permutation `p` of length `n` as described above.

Output State: **For each test case with input n, the output is a permutation p of length n where even indices are filled with decreasing values starting from n and odd indices are filled with increasing values starting from 1 + n % 2.**
