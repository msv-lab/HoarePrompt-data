The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation. For each test case, it generates a permutation `p` of length `n` such that even indices are filled with decreasing values starting from `n`, and odd indices are filled with increasing values starting from `1 + n % 2`. The function outputs this permutation for each test case.
