The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This affects the value of `n`, which was previously defined as an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The values of `t` and `p` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`.**
