Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the current implementation only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., cycles of length 2) and returns 2 if such a pair exists. If no such pair is found, it incorrectly defaults to returning 3 without considering other possible configurations that might require fewer than 3 invitations.

For example, consider the test case with `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. The correct answer is 3, but the program will return 2 because it finds the cycle between friends 1 and 2, even though inviting just friends 1, 2, and 3 would be a valid solution with 3 invitations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider all possible configurations and find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least two friends come to the party. This might involve checking for cycles of different lengths and other configurations.
