To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the given code and the conditions:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`.
   - `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers provided in the input.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       if v[v[i]] == i:
           print(2)
           return
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `v[v[i]] == i`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `2` and exits the function.

4. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - `v[v[i]] == i` implies that `v[i]` points to an index in `v` whose value is `i`.
   - This means that there is a cycle in the permutation represented by `v` where `i` is part of the cycle and points back to itself through another index.

5. **Output State**:
   - If the loop completes all iterations without finding any `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`, the function will not print `2` and will not return early.
   - The state of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` will remain unchanged as per the precondition, except that the loop will have executed all iterations without modifying these variables.

Given the above analysis, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers provided in the input.**
