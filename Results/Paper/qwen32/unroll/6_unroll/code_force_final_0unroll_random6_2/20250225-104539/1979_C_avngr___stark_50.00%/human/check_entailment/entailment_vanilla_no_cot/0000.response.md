Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. If the i-th outcome wins, you receive `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome. The sum of all bets must be strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for any `i`.

### Program Analysis

The program calculates a common multiple of the multipliers `k_i` and uses it to distribute the bets. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   The program calculates the LCM of all `k_i` values. This is done by multiplying all `k_i` together, which is not the most efficient way to compute the LCM, but it works for the given constraints.

2. **Determine Bet Amounts:**
   The program then divides the LCM by each `k_i` to determine the bet amount for each outcome. This ensures that the sum of all bets is the LCM.

3. **Normalize Bet Amounts:**
   The program calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of these bet amounts and divides each bet amount by the GCF to simplify the distribution.

4. **Check Feasibility:**
   The program checks if the sum of the simplified bet amounts is less than the LCM divided by the GCF. If it is, it prints the bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the logic:

- **LCM Calculation:**
  The program multiplies all `k_i` to get a common multiple, which is used as the total sum of bets. This is a valid approach, although it's not the LCM in the strictest sense (it's a multiple of the LCM).

- **Bet Distribution:**
  By dividing the common multiple by each `k_i`, the program ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the return is exactly the common multiple, which is greater than the sum of all bets.

- **Normalization:**
  Dividing by the GCF ensures that the bet amounts are as small as possible while maintaining the required condition.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  The check `sum(c) < m / hcf` is correct because `m / hcf` is the effective total sum of bets after normalization, and it must be strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the bets as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
