You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    return hcf
    #The program returns the GCD of the number of test cases and all the subsequent elements in the list `numbers`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements are integers. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list, including the first element `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to distribute the coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The amount received back if the `i-th` outcome wins is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the number of coins bet on the `i-th` outcome.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values, which is equivalent to finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `k_i` values since all `k_i` are integers greater than 1.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - The program computes `c[i] = m / k[i]` for each `i`, where `m` is the LCM. This is done to ensure that the sum of `c[i]` values is less than `m`.

4. **Simplifying the Bets:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of the `c[i]` values and divides each `c[i]` by this GCF. This step is intended to simplify the bet amounts.

5. **Validation:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the simplified `c[i]` values is less than `m / hcf`. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.

6. **Output:**
   - If a valid distribution is found, the program prints the `c[i]` values.

### Correctness Analysis

The program's approach is fundamentally sound, but there are a few points to consider:
- **LCM Calculation:** The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values, which is indeed the LCM given that all `k_i` are integers greater than 1.
- **Simplification:** The simplification step ensures that the bet amounts are as small as possible while maintaining the condition that the sum of the bets is less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- **Validation:** The validation step correctly checks if the sum of the bets is less than the required amount for any winning outcome.

However, there is a subtle issue with the validation condition:
- The condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` should actually be `sum(c) >= m / k[i]` for any `i`. The current implementation checks against `m / hcf`, which is not the correct threshold.

### Conclusion

Given the above points, the program is almost correct but has a logical flaw in the validation step. The correct validation should check if the sum of bets is less than the amount received for any specific winning outcome, not a generalized `m / hcf`.
