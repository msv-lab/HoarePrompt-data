Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The function returns the GCD of the number of test cases `t` and all the subsequent elements in the list `numbers`.**
