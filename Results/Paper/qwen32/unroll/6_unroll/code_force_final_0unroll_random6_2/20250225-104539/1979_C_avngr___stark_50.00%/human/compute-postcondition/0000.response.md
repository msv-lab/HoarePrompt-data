Output State: **`hcf` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `numbers`, which represents the number of test cases; `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
