The code snippet assigns the string of all lowercase letters to the variable `alphabet`. This means `alphabet` will now hold the value `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. The variables `t` and `n` retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`**.
