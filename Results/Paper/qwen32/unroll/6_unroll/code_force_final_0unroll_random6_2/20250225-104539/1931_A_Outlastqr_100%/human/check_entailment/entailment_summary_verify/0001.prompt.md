You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a constructed word based on the value of `n`. The constructed word is determined by specific rules that depend on whether `n` is less than or equal to 27, between 28 and 52, or greater than 52.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to decode an integer back into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word based on the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.

### Program Analysis
The program uses the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
3. It then determines the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded as `n` using a series of `if-elif-else` statements.

Let's break down the logic for different ranges of `n`:
- If `n > 52`: The word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This means the first letter is `n - 53` positions from 'a', and the last two letters are 'z'.
- If `n > 27`: The word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is `n - 28` positions from 'a', and the last letter is 'z'.
- If `n == 27`: The word is `'aay'`.
- If `n <= 27`: The word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This means the first two letters are 'a', and the last letter is `n - 3` positions from 'a'.

### Verification Against Test Cases
Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:
1. **Input:** `24`
   - `n = 24`
   - Since `24 <= 27`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` = `'aa' + 'r'` = `'aar'`. However, the correct output should be `'aav'` because `'aav'` is lexicographically smaller than `'aar'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

2. **Input:** `70`
   - `n = 70`
   - Since `70 > 52`, the word is `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[17] + 'zz'` = `'rzz'`.
   - This is correct.

3. **Input:** `3`
   - `n = 3`
   - Since `3 <= 27`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` = `'aa' + 'a'` = `'aaa'`.
   - This is correct.

4. **Input:** `55`
   - `n = 55`
   - Since `55 > 52`, the word is `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[2] + 'zz'` = `'bzz'`. However, the correct output should be `'czz'` because `'czz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'bzz'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

5. **Input:** `48`
   - `n = 48`
   - Since `48 > 52` is false and `48 > 27` is true, the word is `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` = `'a' + alphabet[20] + 'z'` = `'atzz'`. However, the correct output should be `'auz'` because `'auz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'atzz'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for certain values of `n`.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
