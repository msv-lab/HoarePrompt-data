To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the variables `n` and `word` based on the input values provided in each iteration. The variable `t` controls the number of iterations, and `n` is redefined in each iteration based on the input. The `word` is constructed differently depending on the value of `n` in each iteration.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- If `n > 52`, `word` becomes the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by `'zz'`.
- If `27 < n <= 52`, `word` becomes `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string followed by `'z'`.
- If `n == 27`, `word` becomes `'aay'`.
- If `n < 27`, `word` becomes `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.

Since the loop executes `t` times, and `t` is the number of iterations, the final output state will be the result of the last iteration of the loop. The variables `t` and `alphabet` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Let's assume the loop runs `t` times, and the value of `n` in the last iteration is `n_last`. The final `word` will be determined by the value of `n_last` as per the above conditions.

Output State: **`word` is the final constructed word based on the value of `n` in the last iteration, `t` remains the same, `n` is the value of `n` in the last iteration, and `alphabet` remains `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.**

Since the specific value of `n_last` is not provided, we can only describe the state in terms of the last iteration's `n` value.

Output State: **`word` is the final constructed word based on the value of `n` in the last iteration, `t` is the same as the initial value, `n` is the value of `n` in the last iteration, and `alphabet` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.**
