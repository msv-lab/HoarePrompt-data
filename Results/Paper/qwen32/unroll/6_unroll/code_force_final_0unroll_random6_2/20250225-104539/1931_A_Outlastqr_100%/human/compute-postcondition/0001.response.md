To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the elements in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78
- `alphabet` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value provided by `int(input())`. If the input value is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since the current state does not provide any information about the input value, we need to specify that the input value must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that the input value to the `range` function is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, the input value must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**
