t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each element x_i satisfies -n <= x_i <= n, x_i != 0, and the elements are strictly increasing (x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
