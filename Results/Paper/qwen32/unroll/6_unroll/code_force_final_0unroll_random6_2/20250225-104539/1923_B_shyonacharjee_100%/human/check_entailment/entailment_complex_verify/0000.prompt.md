You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each element x_i satisfies -n <= x_i <= n, x_i != 0, and the elements are strictly increasing (x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n).

After processing all t test cases, the program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether it is possible to defeat all monsters with the given constraints.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a bullet range multiplier `k`, a list `a` of monster health values, and a list `x` of monster positions. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the total bullets needed and whether the character can survive. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the fact that the character can fire up to `k` bullets per second, and it does not simulate the passage of time correctly.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Bullet Usage**:
   - The program calculates `total_bullets_needed` as `bullets_used + health`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the character can fire up to `k` bullets per second.
   - The program should check if the remaining health of the monster can be handled within the remaining distance multiplied by `k` bullets per second.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list of monsters based on their distance from the character. However, it does not simulate the passage of time correctly.
   - The program should check if the total bullets needed to kill a monster can be used within the number of seconds available before the monster reaches the character.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The monsters are at positions -1, 2, and 3 with health 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
- The character can fire up to 2 bullets per second.
- In the first second, fire 1 bullet at the monster at position -1 and 1 bullet at the monster at position 3.
  - The monster at position -1 dies.
  - The monster at position 2 moves to position 1.
  - The monster at position 3 moves to position 2.
- In the second second, fire 2 bullets at the monster at position 1.
  - The monster at position 1 dies.
- In the third second, fire 2 bullets at the monster at position 2.
  - The monster at position 2 dies.

However, the program might incorrectly determine that it cannot survive because it does not correctly simulate the passage of time and the use of bullets per second.

To fix this, the program should correctly simulate the passage of time and ensure that the total bullets needed to kill each monster can be used within the available time. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            if health > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

In this corrected version, the program checks if the health of each monster can be reduced to zero within the number of seconds available before the monster reaches the character, considering the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second.
