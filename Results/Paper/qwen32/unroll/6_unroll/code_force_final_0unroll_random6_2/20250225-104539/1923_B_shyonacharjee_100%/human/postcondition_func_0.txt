The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a bullet range multiplier `k`, a list `a` of monster health values, and a list `x` of monster positions. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.
