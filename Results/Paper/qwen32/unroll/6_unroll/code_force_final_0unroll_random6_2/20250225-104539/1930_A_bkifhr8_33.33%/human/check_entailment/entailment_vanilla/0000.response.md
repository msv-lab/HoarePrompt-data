Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `2n` positive integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform `n` moves, each time choosing two integers `x` and `y`, adding `min(x, y)` to our score, and removing `x` and `y` from the board.
- The goal is to maximize the final score.

### Optimal Strategy:
To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integers together. This is because, by pairing the smallest integers, we ensure that we are adding the smallest possible values to our score, which is the goal of the game.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Logic for Calculating the Score:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `0` for each test case.
   - It then iterates `n` times, each time attempting to add the minimum of two integers to `ans` and remove those integers from the list.
   
3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not sort the list of integers before processing, which is crucial for the optimal strategy.
   - The removal logic inside the loop is incorrect. `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` will always try to remove the first element twice, which is incorrect.
   - The `if len(lst) != 2` condition is unnecessary and the `else` block is redundant.
   
4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The list of integers should be sorted.
   - We should then pair the smallest integers together and add the minimum of each pair to the score.
   
### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to pair the smallest integers together
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]  # Add the smaller of the pair (which is lst[i] after sorting)
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. It fails to sort the list and incorrectly handles the removal of elements.

**Correctness: False**
