### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the provided code and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the score by performing `n` moves where each move involves selecting two numbers from a list of `2n` numbers, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both numbers.
- The goal is to find the optimal strategy to maximize the final score.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - The list of integers is split into a list of strings and then converted to integers.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Maximum Score:**
   - The program aims to perform `n` moves, each time adding the minimum of two selected numbers to the score.
   - The loop intended to perform `n` moves is flawed:
     - The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is unnecessary and incorrect. The loop should run exactly `n` times.
     - The removal of elements from the list is incorrect. The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is incorrect because it does not remove the first two elements. Instead, it should use `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)` to remove the first two elements in each iteration.
     - The loop should iterate exactly `n` times, removing two elements in each iteration and adding the minimum of the two to the score.

3. **Output:**
   - The program stores the score for each test case in the list `ans_f` and prints each score after all test cases are processed.

#### Issues Identified:
- The loop does not correctly ensure that it runs exactly `n` times.
- The removal of elements from the list is incorrect.
- The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is unnecessary and incorrect for the logic of the problem.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues with the logic and the way elements are removed from the list, the program is not correct. The program does not guarantee that it will always select the optimal pairs to maximize the score.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed logic and incorrect element removal.

**Final: False**
