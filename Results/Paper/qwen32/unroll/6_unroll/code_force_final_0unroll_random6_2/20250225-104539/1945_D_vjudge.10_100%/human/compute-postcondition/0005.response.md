Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases where each test case involves two lists `a` and `b`, and integers `n` and `m`. It calculates a value based on the minimum sums of elements from `a` and `b` and prints the smallest value of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`, where `x` is the cumulative sum of the minimums of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` in reverse order.**
