#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers where each list contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: pergunta is the smallest value of x + a[i] for all i < m, x is the sum of min(a[i], b[i]) for all i from n-1 to 0.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the smallest value of x + a[i] for all i < m, and x is the sum of min(a[i], b[i]) for all i from n-1 to 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases where each test case involves two lists `a` and `b`, and integers `n` and `m`. It calculates a value based on the minimum sums of elements from `a` and `b` and prints the smallest value of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`, where `x` is the cumulative sum of the minimums of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` in reverse order.
