You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

The problem requires us to determine the number of ways to select 3 sticks from a set of sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. A non-degenerate triangle is one where the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

The given program seems to be attempting to solve this problem by counting the occurrences of each stick length (which is a power of 2) and then using combinatorial formulas to count the number of valid selections. However, the provided program does not correctly implement the triangle inequality condition.

Here's a breakdown of the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their respective lengths (powers of 2).
3. It counts the occurrences of each stick length.
4. It then uses combinatorial formulas to calculate the number of ways to select 3 sticks, but it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

The program uses the following combinatorial formulas:
- `ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for pairs of sticks of the same length combined with a different length.
- `ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for triplets of sticks of the same length.

However, none of these formulas ensure that the selected sticks satisfy the triangle inequality. The triangle inequality requires that for any three sticks with lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `a <= b <= c`), the condition `a + b > c` must hold. The provided program does not check this condition.

Let's consider the correct approach:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of sticks and their respective lengths.
3. Sort the lengths of the sticks.
4. Use three nested loops to check all combinations of three sticks and count the ones that satisfy the triangle inequality.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect because it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

Correctness: **False**
