You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3

    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The current implementation counts combinations of sticks based on their frequencies but does not check the triangle inequality condition, which is essential for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. In this context, the sticks have lengths of the form \(2^{a_i}\), so the triangle inequality conditions are:
1. \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\)
2. \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_j}\)
3. \(2^{a_j} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_i}\)

The provided code does not check these conditions. Instead, it simply counts combinations of sticks based on their frequencies, which is insufficient to ensure that the selected sticks can form a triangle.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

In this case, the sticks have lengths \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\). The combination (2, 4, 8) does not form a triangle because \(2 + 4 \not> 8\). However, there is no valid combination of three sticks that can form a triangle in this case, so the expected output is 0. But the code fails to handle such cases correctly in general.

To fix this, the code should iterate through all combinations of three sticks and check the triangle inequality conditions explicitly.
