### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking for the substrings "map" and "pie" in the given string `s`. The program counts the minimum number of deletions required to remove these substrings, assuming that each removal of "map" or "pie" reduces the count by one.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to zero, which will track the number of deletions.
   - It iterates over the string `s` using a while loop with an index `i`.
   - For each position in the string, it checks if the substring from `i` to `i+2` is either "map" or "pie".
   - If a match is found, it increments the index `i` by 3 (to skip the matched substring) and increments the counter `ans` by 1.
   - If no match is found, it simply increments the index `i` by 1.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing the entire string for a test case, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Analysis:

- **Non-overlapping Occurrences:** The program correctly identifies non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" by incrementing the index `i` by 3 when a match is found. This ensures that once a match is detected, the program skips over that part of the string to avoid counting overlapping matches.
  
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as strings shorter than 3 characters (where no matches are possible) and strings that do not contain either "map" or "pie" (where the output should be 0).

- **Efficiency:** The program runs in O(n) time complexity for each test case, where n is the length of the string. Given the constraints (with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 10^6), this is efficient enough.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful by removing non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".

### Correctness:
