You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Output

    0
    2

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in `s`, and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The task is to make the string `s` beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- The program should output the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Logic in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates through the string `a` in chunks of 3 characters.
   - If a chunk matches "map" or "pie", it increments the answer `ans` by 1 and skips the next 3 characters.
   - If a chunk does not match, it moves to the next character.
   
2. **Edge Cases and Potential Issues:**
   - The program only checks non-overlapping chunks of 3 characters. This means that it might not handle cases where the substrings "map" or "pie" overlap.
   - For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will only remove "map" and leave "pie", resulting in an incorrect answer.
   - Another example is "mapmap". The program will only remove the first "map" and leave the second "map", again resulting in an incorrect answer.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly, which means it is not guaranteed to produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
1
6
mappie
```
The program will output `1`, but the correct output should be `2` because both "map" and "pie" need to be removed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
