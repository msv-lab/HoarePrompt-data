Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking for non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". When such a substring is found, it increments the index by 3 to skip over the found substring and increments the count of deletions. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful for all cases.

Consider the following test case:
Input:
```
1
11
pppiepieeee
```
The correct output should be `2` because we can remove the second 'p' and the second 'i' to make the string "pppeeeee", which is beautiful. However, the program will only find the first "pie" and remove it, resulting in "ppieeeee", and then find the next "pie" and remove it, resulting in "ppeeee", which is unnecessary deletions.

The program does not consider overlapping occurrences and does not ensure the minimum deletions are made. It only counts non-overlapping occurrences and removes them, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
