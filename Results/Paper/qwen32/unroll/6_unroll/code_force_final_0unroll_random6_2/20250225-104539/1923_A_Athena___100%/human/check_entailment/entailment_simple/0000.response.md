### Reasoning:
The program's objective is to determine the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The program accomplishes this by counting the number of free cells (represented as `0`s) between the first and last chip (represented as `1`s) in the list after removing any leading and trailing free cells.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Reading:** The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.
   - It initializes a counter `res` to zero, which will store the number of operations.
   - It removes any leading free cells (cells with `0`s) from the list `a` by using a while loop that pops elements from the front of the list as long as the first element is `0`.
   - It removes any trailing free cells from the list `a` by using a while loop that pops elements from the end of the list as long as the last element is `0`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining list `a` and increments `res` for each free cell (`0`).
3. **Output:** For each test case, it prints the value of `res`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:
- **First Test Case:**  
  Input: `8`  
  List: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`  
  After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`  
  Number of zeros between the first and last `1`: `1`  
  Output: `1`
  
- **Second Test Case:**  
  Input: `6`  
  List: `0 1 0 0 0 0`  
  After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`  
  Number of zeros between the first and last `1`: `0`  
  Output: `0`
  
- **Third Test Case:**  
  Input: `6`  
  List: `1 1 1 1 1 1`  
  After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`  
  Number of zeros between the first and last `1`: `0`  
  Output: `0`
  
- **Fourth Test Case:**  
  Input: `5`  
  List: `1 0 1 0 1`  
  After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`  
  Number of zeros between the first and last `1`: `2`  
  Output: `2`
  
- **Fifth Test Case:**  
  Input: `9`  
  List: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`  
  After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`  
  Number of zeros between the first and last `1`: `3`  
  Output: `3`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required for each test case as demonstrated by the example test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
