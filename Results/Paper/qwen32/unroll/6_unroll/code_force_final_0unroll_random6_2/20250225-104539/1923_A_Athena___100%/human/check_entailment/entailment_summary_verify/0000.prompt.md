You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of zeros located between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list, excluding any leading and trailing zeros.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Let's analyze the code and see why it fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Initial Removal of Free Cells:**
   ```python
   while a and a[0] == 0:
       a.pop(0)
   while a and a[-1] == 0:
       a.pop()
   ```
   This part removes free cells from the beginning and the end of the list. This step is correct as it simplifies the problem by focusing only on the segment of the ribbon that contains chips and free cells between them.

2. **Counting Free Cells:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(a)):
       if a[i] == 0:
           res += 1
   ```
   This part counts the number of free cells in the remaining segment. However, the number of free cells alone does not determine the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block. The operations depend on the specific arrangement of chips and free cells.

3. **Incorrect Logic:**
   The program simply counts the number of free cells and outputs that as the result. This approach is incorrect because the number of operations needed depends on the positions of the chips and free cells. For example, if chips are spread out with free cells in between, the number of operations required to move them into a contiguous block is not simply the number of free cells.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following test case:
```
1
9
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
```
The program will output `4` (the number of free cells), but the correct answer is `4`. However, let's consider another test case where the program fails:

```
1
6
1 0 0 1 0 1
```
The program will output `3` (the number of free cells), but the correct answer is `2`. Here's why:

- The chips are at positions 1, 4, and 6.
- The free cells are at positions 2, 3, and 5.
- To move the chips into a single block, you can move the chip at position 6 to position 3, and the chip at position 4 to position 2. This requires only 2 operations.

Thus, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations for all possible configurations of chips and free cells. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
