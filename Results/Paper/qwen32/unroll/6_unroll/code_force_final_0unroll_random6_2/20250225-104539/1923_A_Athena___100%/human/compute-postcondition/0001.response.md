The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable in Python, used when the loop variable is not needed. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to consider any variables or states introduced within the loop. The only state we need to confirm is that `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000**
