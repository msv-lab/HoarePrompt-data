Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, where 2 <= n <= 50. It also accepts a list of `n` integers, each being either 0 or 1, with at least one element being 1. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the integer 1 in each test case.**
