Let's analyze the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop statement is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head contains the following elements:
- `_`: This is a throwaway variable used to iterate over a range.
- `range(int(input()))`: This indicates that the loop will iterate a number of times equal to the integer value read from the input.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if and only if the integer read from the input is greater than 0.
- The variable `t` is mentioned in the state description but is not part of the loop head. Therefore, we cannot adjust `t` to ensure the loop executes.
- The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the state description but are not part of the loop head either. Thus, we cannot adjust `n` or `a` to ensure the loop executes.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the integer value read from the input, which must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes. Since we cannot directly adjust the input in the code, we assume that the input is already provided and must meet the condition.

### Final State:
Since we can't directly modify the input in the code, we describe the condition that must be met for the loop to execute.

State: **The integer read from the input must be greater than 0.**

This ensures that the loop will execute the specified number of times.
