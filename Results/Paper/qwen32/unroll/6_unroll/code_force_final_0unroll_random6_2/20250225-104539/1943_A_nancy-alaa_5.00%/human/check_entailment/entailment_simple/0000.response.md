### Reasoning:

The given problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` to form a new array `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.

3. **Determine MEX:**
   - The code iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checks if the number is not in the `Counter` dictionary (`mpp`).
   - If a number is not in `mpp`, it means that number is not present in `a`, and hence, it is the MEX.
   - If a number is present exactly once in `mpp` and it is the first such number, it prints that number as the MEX. However, this part of the logic seems flawed because it does not account for the optimal strategy of Alice and Bob.

4. **Flaw in Logic:**
   - The current logic does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply looks for the first number that is either not present or present exactly once, which does not necessarily reflect the optimal play.
   - Alice and Bob's strategies would affect which numbers end up in `c`, and the MEX would be determined based on the final composition of `c` after all elements are picked.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice tries to maximize the MEX, so she would try to delay adding the smallest numbers to `c` as long as possible.
   - Bob tries to minimize the MEX, so he would try to add the smallest numbers to `c` as soon as possible.
   - The optimal strategy would involve simulating the turns, but the provided code does not do this. Instead, it makes a premature decision based on the initial counts.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the MEX based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
