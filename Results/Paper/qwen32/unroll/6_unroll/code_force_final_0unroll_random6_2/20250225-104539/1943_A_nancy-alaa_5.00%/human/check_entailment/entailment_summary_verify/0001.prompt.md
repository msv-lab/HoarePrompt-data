You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer from 0 to `n-1` that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once, with the condition that if multiple such integers exist, the smallest one that appears exactly once is printed only if there is no integer that does not appear at all.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from array `a` and manipulating array `c` and `a` according to the rules. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c` after all elements are removed from `a`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations

1. **Turns and Optimal Play**: Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make the best moves possible to achieve their objectives. Alice will try to add elements to `c` that increase the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent this.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is determined by the smallest missing non-negative integer in `c`. Therefore, the goal is to ensure that `c` contains as many consecutive integers starting from 0 as possible, but Alice and Bob's actions affect this.

### Strategy

- **Alice's Goal**: To maximize MEX, Alice should aim to add elements to `c` that extend the sequence of consecutive integers as much as possible.
- **Bob's Goal**: To minimize MEX, Bob should aim to disrupt the sequence of consecutive integers by picking elements that Alice might have chosen to extend the sequence.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `a`. It then iterates through the possible integers from 0 to `n-1` to find the MEX. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Counting Elements**: The `Counter` object `mpp` is used to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
2. **Finding MEX**: The program iterates through integers from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is not present in `a` at all, so it is the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` is present in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` as the MEX.
   - The variable `first` is set to `True` when the first element with a count of 1 is encountered.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly account for the turns and optimal play of Alice and Bob. It simply finds the first integer that appears once or is missing, which does not consider the strategic removal of elements by Bob.
2. **Lack of Turn Handling**: The program does not simulate the turns or the strategic removal of elements by Bob, which is crucial for determining the correct MEX.
3. **Incorrect Use of `first` Variable**: The `first` variable is used incorrectly. It does not help in determining the MEX correctly based on the game rules.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
