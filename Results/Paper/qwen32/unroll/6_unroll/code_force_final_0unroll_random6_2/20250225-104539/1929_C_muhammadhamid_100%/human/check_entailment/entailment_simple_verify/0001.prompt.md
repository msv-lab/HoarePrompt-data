You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around Sasha's ability to guarantee that he can reach any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino. The key parameters are:
- `k`: The multiplier for the bet in case of a win.
- `x`: The maximum number of consecutive losses allowed.
- `a`: The initial number of coins Sasha has.

The strategy involves placing bets in such a way that Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue increasing his coins indefinitely.

### Strategy

To ensure Sasha can reach any `n` coins, the strategy revolves around the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` consecutive times. After `x` consecutive losses, Sasha must still be able to recover and start betting again.

Let's denote `s` as the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses and continue increasing his coins.

### Calculation of `s`

The minimum number of coins `s` can be calculated as follows:
- After the first loss, Sasha has `s - 1` coins.
- After the second loss, Sasha has `s - 1 - 1` coins.
- After the third loss, Sasha has `s - 1 - 1 - 1` coins.
- ...
- After `x` losses, Sasha has `s - x` coins.

To recover from `x` losses, Sasha needs to be able to place a bet and win enough to recover his losses and continue betting. The minimum bet after `x` losses is 1 coin, and the maximum bet he can place is `s - x` coins.

After winning, the coins should be enough to cover the previous losses and still allow for further betting. This means:
- After winning, Sasha should have enough coins to place the next bet.

The formula for `s` can be derived as:
\[ s = 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 + \ldots \text{(x times)} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ s = 1 + x + x \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor \]

However, the program uses a simpler approximation:
\[ s = 1 + \sum_{i=0}^{x-1} \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

This approximation can be simplified to:
\[ s = 1 + x + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor \cdot x \]

The program iteratively calculates this value until it stabilizes.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins `s` required to guarantee that Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses and continue increasing his coins. The program then checks if the initial number of coins `a` is at least `s`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. For each test case, read the values `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. Initialize `s` to 1.
3. Iterate `x` times, updating `s` as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
4. Compare `a` with `s` and print "Yes" if `a >= s`, otherwise print "No".

### Correctness Check

The program's logic is based on the iterative calculation of the minimum number of coins `s` required to recover from `x` consecutive losses. The iterative approach ensures that the value of `s` stabilizes to the correct minimum value.

Given the problem constraints and the iterative approach, the program correctly determines whether Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.

### Conclusion

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
