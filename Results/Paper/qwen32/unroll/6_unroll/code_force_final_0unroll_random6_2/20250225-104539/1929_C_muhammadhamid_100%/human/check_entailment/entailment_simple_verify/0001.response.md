### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the program to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining if Sasha can guarantee that he can reach any number of coins `n` given:
- `k`: The multiplier for the bet in case of a win.
- `x`: The maximum number of consecutive losses allowed.
- `a`: The initial number of coins Sasha has.

The key strategy is to ensure that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha can still recover and continue betting. The program calculates the minimum number of coins `s` required to guarantee this recovery.

#### Strategy

The strategy involves calculating `s` such that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha can still place bets and recover. The calculation of `s` involves iterative updates to ensure that the value stabilizes to the minimum required coins.

The iterative formula used in the program is:
\[ s = s + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

This formula is applied `x` times to calculate the minimum required coins `s`.

#### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program step-by-step:
1. For each test case, read `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. Initialize `s` to 1.
3. Iterate `x` times, updating `s` as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
4. Compare `a` with `s` and print "Yes" if `a >= s`, otherwise print "No".

The program's logic is based on iteratively calculating `s` to ensure that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha can still recover and continue betting.

#### Correctness Check

The iterative approach in the program ensures that `s` stabilizes to the correct minimum value required for Sasha to recover from `x` consecutive losses. This is because each iteration accounts for the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` consecutive times and still needs enough coins to recover and continue betting.

The annotations provided in the annotated code confirm that the program correctly calculates `s` and compares it with `a` to determine if Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.

#### Conclusion

Based on the problem description, the strategy, and the iterative approach used in the program, the program correctly determines whether Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
