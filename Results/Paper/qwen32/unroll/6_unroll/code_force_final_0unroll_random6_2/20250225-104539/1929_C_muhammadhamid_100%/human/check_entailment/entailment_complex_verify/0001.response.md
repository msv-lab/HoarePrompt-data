Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, and the annotations to verify the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he can reach any number of coins `n` starting with `a` coins, given the rules of the casino:
- If Sasha wins a bet of `y` coins, he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins.
- If Sasha loses a bet of `y` coins, he loses `y` coins.
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
- The bet amount must be a positive integer and cannot exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

The key is to find if there is a strategy such that Sasha can always recover from any sequence of losses up to `x` consecutive losses and continue increasing his coins indefinitely.

### Strategy

The strategy revolves around ensuring that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha still has enough coins to place a bet and potentially win back his losses plus some additional coins to continue betting.

### Calculation of `s`

The variable `s` represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses and continue increasing his coins. The iterative calculation in the program attempts to determine this minimum `s`.

The iterative formula:
\[ s = s + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]
is repeated `x` times. This formula attempts to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` consecutive times and then needs to recover.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:
1. For each test case, read the values `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. Initialize `s` to 1.
3. Iterate `x` times, updating `s` as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
4. Compare `a` with `s` and print "Yes" if `a >= s`, otherwise print "No".

### Correctness Check

The provided program iteratively calculates `s` to determine the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee that he can recover from `x` consecutive losses. The iterative approach ensures that `s` stabilizes to a value that reflects the worst-case scenario.

However, let's verify the logic with a few test cases to ensure it is correct.

#### Test Case 1: `k = 2, x = 1, a = 7`
- Initial `s = 1`
- After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
- Since `a = 7 >= s = 3`, the output should be "Yes".

#### Test Case 2: `k = 2, x = 1, a = 1`
- Initial `s = 1`
- After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
- Since `a = 1 < s = 3`, the output should be "No".

#### Test Case 3: `k = 2, x = 3, a = 15`
- Initial `s = 1`
- After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`
- After 2 iterations: `s = 3 + 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7`
- After 3 iterations: `s = 7 + 7 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 15`
- Since `a = 15 >= s = 15`, the output should be "Yes".

#### Test Case 4: `k = 3, x = 3, a = 6`
- Initial `s = 1`
- After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 2`
- After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 3`
- After 3 iterations: `s = 3 + 3 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 4`
- Since `a = 6 >= s = 4`, the output should be "Yes".

However, the expected output for `k = 3, x = 3, a = 6` is "NO". This indicates that the iterative calculation might not be correctly simulating the worst-case scenario.

### Conclusion

Upon closer inspection, the iterative calculation in the program does not correctly simulate the worst-case scenario. The formula used might not be accurate for all values of `k` and `x`. Therefore, the original assessment might be inaccurate.

Final: **False**
