To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior for each test case. The loop processes each test case by reading three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, calculates a value `s` through an inner loop, and then checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. The result of this comparison ('Yes' or 'No') is printed for each test case.

Given the format of the initial state and the nature of the loop, the output state will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each test case.

Let's break down the inner loop:
- `s` is initialized to 1.
- For `x` iterations, `s` is updated using the formula: `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

The final value of `s` after `x` iterations depends on the values of `k` and `x`. The comparison `a >= s` determines the output for each test case.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `k`, `x`, and `a`, we can only describe the output state in a general manner based on the logic of the loop.

The output state will be a sequence of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each test case. Each response is determined by whether the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s` after the inner loop completes.

Output State: **a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each test case, based on the comparison of `a` and the final value of `s`.**
