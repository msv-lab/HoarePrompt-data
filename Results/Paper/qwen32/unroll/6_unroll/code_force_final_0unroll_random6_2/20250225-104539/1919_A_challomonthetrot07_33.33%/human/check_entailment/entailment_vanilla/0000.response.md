Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: Alice has `a` coins and Bob has `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns, starting with Alice. In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from the current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins) loses.

### Key Observations:
- If `a == b`, the game can be analyzed based on the parity (even or odd nature) of `a` and `b`.
- If `a == 1` or `b == 1`, the player with 1 coin will lose because they must remove a coin on their turn, leaving the opponent with the other wallet.
- If `a` and `b` are both greater than 1, the game can be analyzed based on the parity of `a` and `b`.

### Optimal Strategy:
- If `a == b` and both are even, Alice will win because she can force Bob into a losing position.
- If `a == b` and both are odd, Bob will win because Alice's first move will make `a` and `b` even, putting Bob in the winning position.
- If `a == 1`, Alice will lose because she must remove the coin, leaving Bob with all the coins.
- If `b == 1`, Bob will lose because Alice can swap and then remove the coin.
- If `a` is odd, Bob will win because Alice will make `a` even on her first move, putting Bob in a winning position.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice will win because she can maintain the parity advantage.
- If `a > b`, the game can be analyzed based on the parity of `a` and `b`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's check the provided program against the observations and optimal strategy:

1. **`if a == b:`**:
   - If `a` and `b` are both even, the program should print 'Alice', but it prints 'Bob'. **Incorrect**.
   - If `a` and `b` are both odd, the program should print 'Bob', which is correct.

2. **`elif a == 1:`**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Alice' because Alice will lose in this case.

3. **`elif b == 1:`**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Bob' because Bob will lose in this case.

4. **`elif a % 2 == 1:`**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Bob' because if `a` is odd, Bob will win.

5. **`elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:`**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Alice' because if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice will win.

6. **`elif a > b:`**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that `a > b` means Bob wins, which is not always the case based on the parity of `a` and `b`.

7. **`else:`**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if none of the above conditions are met, Alice wins, which is not always true.

### Conclusion:
The program contains several logical errors that do not align with the optimal strategy and game analysis. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
