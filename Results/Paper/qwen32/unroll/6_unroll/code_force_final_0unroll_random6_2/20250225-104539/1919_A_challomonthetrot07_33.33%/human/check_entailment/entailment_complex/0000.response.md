Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the provided conditions and see if they correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described:

1. **If `a == b`:** According to the problem, if both players have the same number of coins, the player who starts the game (Alice) will always lose if both play optimally. This is because each player will mirror the other's moves, and Bob will make the last move. Hence, the condition `if a == b: print('Bob')` is correct.

2. **If `a == 1`:** If Alice starts with 1 coin, she can only take that coin and leave Bob with all the coins. Thus, Bob wins. The condition `elif a == 1: print('Alice')` is incorrect; it should be `elif a == 1: print('Bob')`.

3. **If `b == 1`:** If Bob starts with 1 coin after Alice's potential swap, Bob will lose because Alice can take her coin and leave Bob with no coins. The condition `elif b == 1: print('Bob')` is correct.

4. **If `a % 2 == 1`:** If `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he has an even number of coins by swapping or not swapping optimally. Since the player with an even number of coins will eventually lose, Alice wins. The condition `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Bob')` is incorrect; it should be `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Alice')`.

5. **If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`:** If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she has an odd number of coins. Thus, Bob wins. The condition `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1: print('Alice')` is incorrect; it should be `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1: print('Bob')`.

6. **If `a > b`:** The provided condition `elif a > b: print('Bob')` is not universally correct without considering the parity of `a` and `b`. It doesn't account for the optimal play strategy based on the parity of the numbers.

7. **Else:** The final condition `else: print('Alice')` is too broad and doesn't account for the parity of `b` when `a < b`.

Given the incorrect handling of some conditions, especially the cases when `a == 1` and `a % 2 == 1`, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
