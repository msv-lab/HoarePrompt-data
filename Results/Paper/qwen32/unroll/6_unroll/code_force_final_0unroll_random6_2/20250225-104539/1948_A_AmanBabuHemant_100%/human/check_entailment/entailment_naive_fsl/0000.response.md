Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that the number of special characters `n` must be even to form a suitable string. However, the problem description does not impose such a restriction. In fact, the problem allows for odd values of `n` as well.

Let's consider the case when `n` is 1:
- According to the problem, there should be exactly one special character in the string.
- The program will print "NO" for odd values of `n` because it checks if `n % 2` is true (i.e., `n` is odd) and prints "NO" in that case.
- However, for `n = 1`, a valid string could be "AB" where 'A' is the special character.

Another example, `n = 3`:
- A valid string could be "AABAC", where 'A' at positions 1 and 3, and 'B' at position 2 are special characters.
- The program will print "NO" for `n = 3`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `n` is odd. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
