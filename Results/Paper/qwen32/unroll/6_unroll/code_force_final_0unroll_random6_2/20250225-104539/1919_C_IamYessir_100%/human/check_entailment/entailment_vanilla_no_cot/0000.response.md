Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum possible penalty. The logic used to split the array into subsequences `s` and `t` is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the subsequences are formed in a way that minimizes the penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

To solve the problem optimally, a better approach would be to consider the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the array. The minimum penalty can be achieved by placing the LNDS in one subsequence and the remaining elements in the other subsequence. The penalty for the LNDS will be `len(LNDS) - 1`, and the penalty for the remaining elements will be 0 if they are placed in a non-decreasing order, which can always be done.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    import bisect

    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    pos = 0
    t = int(input[pos])
    pos += 1
    results = []

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[pos])
        pos += 1
        a = list(map(int, input[pos:pos + n]))
        pos += n

        # Find the Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence (LNDS)
        lnds = []
        for num in a:
            if not lnds or num >= lnds[-1]:
                lnds.append(num)
            else:
                idx = bisect.bisect_right(lnds, num)
                lnds[idx] = num

        # The penalty for the LNDS is len(lnds) - 1
        penalty_lnds = len(lnds) - 1
        # The penalty for the remaining elements is 0
        penalty_remaining = 0
        # Total penalty is the sum of both penalties
        total_penalty = penalty_lnds + penalty_remaining
        results.append(total_penalty)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This implementation uses binary search to efficiently find the LNDS and calculates the minimum penalty correctly.
