### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking the values of `n` and `k` and then constructing an appropriate array `a` based on these values:

1. **If `k == n`**: The program outputs an array of `n` ones. This is correct because if `k == n`, all cyclic shifts must be sorted. An array with all identical elements (like all ones) will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.

2. **If `k == 1`**: The program outputs the first `n` non-negative integers (i.e., `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`). This is correct because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted, and its cyclic shifts are not sorted (except for the shift starting with `0`). Therefore, only the original array is sorted.

3. **If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`**: The program outputs `-1`. This is incorrect because there might be valid arrays for values of `k` other than `1` or `n`. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`, which has two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 1, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles the cases `k == n` and `k == 1` correctly but fails to handle other values of `k` properly. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible values of `k`.

### Correctness: **False**
