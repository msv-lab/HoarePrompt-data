Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program only considers three scenarios:

1. If `k == n`, it outputs an array of `n` ones.
2. If `k == 1`, it outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
3. For any other value of `k`, it outputs `-1`.

However, these scenarios do not cover all possible valid arrays for every value of `k` between 1 and `n`. For example, consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program outputs `-1` for this case, but there are valid arrays that satisfy the conditions. One such array is `[1, 2, 1]`, which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts:
- Shift 1: `[1, 2, 1]` (sorted)
- Shift 2: `[2, 1, 1]` (sorted)
- Shift 3: `[1, 1, 2]` (not sorted)

Thus, the program should be able to generate such arrays for other values of `k` as well, not just `k = 1` or `k = n`.

To handle all cases correctly, the program would need a more sophisticated approach to construct the array based on the value of `k`.
