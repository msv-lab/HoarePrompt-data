Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array:** An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shift:** A cyclic shift of an array involves rotating the array. For example, the cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 3, 3]` are `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, `[2, 3, 3, 1]`, `[3, 3, 1, 2]`, and `[3, 1, 2, 3]`.
3. **Objective:** Given `n` and `k`, find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, return `-1`.

### Test Cases:
1. **n = 2, k = 2:** The array `[1, 1]` or any array where all elements are the same satisfies this condition because all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
2. **n = 3, k = 1:** The array `[69420, 69, 420]` satisfies this condition because only the first cyclic shift `[69420, 69, 420]` is sorted.
3. **n = 3, k = 2:** No such array exists because if two cyclic shifts are sorted, the array must have some regularity that would likely make more than two shifts sorted.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program handles three specific cases:
1. **k = n:** The program returns an array of `n` ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`). This is correct because all cyclic shifts of this array will be sorted.
2. **k = 1:** The program returns the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This is correct because only the first cyclic shift will be sorted.
3. **k ≠ 1 and k ≠ n:** The program returns `-1`. This is correct because, as shown in the test case `n = 3, k = 2`, no such array exists.

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers within the specified ranges.
- For each test case, the program sets `res` based on the value of `k`:
  - If `k == n`, `res` is set to `[1] * n`.
  - If `k == 1`, `res` is set to `range(n)`, which is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
  - If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, `res` is set to `[-1]`.
- The annotations confirm the program's logic and the state of `res` after each condition check.

### Validation:
Let's validate the program's behavior with the test cases:
1. **n = 2, k = 2:** The program returns `[1, 1]`, which is correct because all cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. **n = 3, k = 1:** The program returns `[0, 1, 2]`, which is correct because only the first cyclic shift is sorted.
3. **n = 3, k = 2:** The program returns `-1`, which is correct because no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and returns valid results based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
