The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y` respectively. The initial state does not specify any values for `x` and `y`, and these variables are not mentioned in the initial state, so we can assume they are being initialized here.

Given that the initial state includes `n`, `t`, the tree edges, and `u_1`, these variables remain unchanged by this code snippet. The only change is the introduction of `x` and `y` with values derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer and t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the node where the stone is initially put, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input.**
