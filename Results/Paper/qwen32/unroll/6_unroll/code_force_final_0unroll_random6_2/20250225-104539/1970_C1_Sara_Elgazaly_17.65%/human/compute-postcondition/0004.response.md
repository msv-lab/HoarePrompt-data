Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer and t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the node where the stone is initially put, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, now containing the adjacency list of the tree. `s` is True.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `s` is now `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
