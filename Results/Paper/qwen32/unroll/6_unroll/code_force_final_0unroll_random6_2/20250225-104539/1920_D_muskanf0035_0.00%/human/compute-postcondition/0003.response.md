Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` (either 1 or 2) and `x` (where `x` is between 1 and `n` if `b` is 1, and `x` is greater than or equal to 1 if `b` is 2); and `queries`, a list of positive integers representing the queries. The function processes these operations and queries and returns a list of results corresponding to each query.**
