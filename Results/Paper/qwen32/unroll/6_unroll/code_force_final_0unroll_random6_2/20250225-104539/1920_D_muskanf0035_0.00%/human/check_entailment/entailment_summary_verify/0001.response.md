Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Operations**:
  1. Append an integer `x` to the end of array `a`.
  2. Append `x` copies of array `a` to the end of array `a`.

- **Queries**:
  - For each query, determine the `k`-th element of the array `a` after all operations.

### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `array` and a list `result` to store the answers to the queries.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The program iterates through each operation.
   - If the operation type `op_type` is 1, it appends the value `value` to the `array`.
   - If the operation type `op_type` is 2, it attempts to extend the `array` by duplicating its current contents `value` times using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. However, this code only appends the array once to itself, which is incorrect. It should append the array `value` times.

3. **Answering Queries**:
   - The program processes each query. For each query `k`, it calculates the `(k - 1) % len(array)` index and appends the element at that index to the `result` list. This part of the code is correct assuming the `array` has been constructed correctly according to the problem statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Function Summary
The function summary for `func_2` indicates that it reads multiple test cases, processes the operations, and outputs the results based on the queries. However, the summary does not address the critical issue with the implementation of the second type of operation.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies the primary issue: the incorrect implementation of the second type of operation. The code only appends the array once instead of `x` times, leading to incorrect array constructions and incorrect query results.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program is indeed incorrect due to the issue with the second type of operation. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
