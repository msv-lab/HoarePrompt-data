### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Initialization**: An empty list `array` is initialized to keep track of the array `a` as described in the problem.
    - **Processing Operations**:
        - If the operation type is `1`, the integer `value` is appended to `array`.
        - If the operation type is `2`, the current `array` is extended by appending `value` copies of itself. However, the current implementation of extending the array by `value` copies is incorrect. It should extend the array by appending itself `value - 1` times (since it already contains one copy of itself). The correct way to do this is `array.extend(array * (value - 1))`.
    - **Query Processing**:
        - For each query `k`, the `k`-th element of the array is determined by `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. This is correct because array indices in Python are 0-based, and the problem specifies 1-based indexing for queries.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Input Reading**:
        - The number of test cases `t` is read.
        - For each test case, `n` (number of operations) and `q` (number of queries) are read.
        - The operations and queries are read and passed to `func_1`.
    - **Output**:
        - The results from `func_1` are printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- The critical issue is in the implementation of the second type of operation in `func_1`. The current implementation incorrectly extends the array by appending itself `value` times instead of `value - 1` times. This will result in incorrect array construction and, consequently, incorrect query results.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issue in the implementation of the second type of operation, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
