In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the number of test cases, `t`. The loop variable `tc` is used to index each test case. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` and `tc`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for tc in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input. The variable `tc` will take on values from 0 to `t-1`.

2. **State Before the Loop**: The state before the loop starts includes the value of `t` (which is obtained from the input) and potentially other variables like `n` and the array `a`. However, according to the task, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

3. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute. The variable `tc` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
