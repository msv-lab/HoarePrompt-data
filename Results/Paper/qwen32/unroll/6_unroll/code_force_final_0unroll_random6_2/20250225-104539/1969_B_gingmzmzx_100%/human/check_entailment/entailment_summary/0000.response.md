### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

The provided program calculates the number of inversions in each binary string. An inversion in a binary string is a pair of indices (i, j) such that `i < j` and `s[i] > s[j]`. In the context of a binary string, an inversion corresponds to a '1' that appears before a '0'. The number of inversions in a binary string is equivalent to the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the string, which can be translated into the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.

Here’s a breakdown of the program’s logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
3. It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
4. It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
5. It iterates through the string and for each character:
   - If the character is '0', it adds to the answer `ans` the number of '1's encountered so far (i.e., `cnt[1]`).
   - If the character is '1', it adds to the answer `ans` the number of zeroes remaining in the string (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).
6. It prints the answer `ans` for each test case.

This approach correctly counts the number of inversions in the binary string, which is the minimum cost to sort the string using the allowed operations.
