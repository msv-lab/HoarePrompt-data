In the provided task, the for loop iterates over the range of `n`, where `n` is equal to `t` (the number of test cases). The loop head only contains the loop variable `_` and the range variable `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set correctly so that the loop can execute the correct number of times based on the number of test cases.

Given that the loop will iterate `n` times, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is set to the number of test cases, which is already provided as `t`. The loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is assigned a value during each iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is equal to `t`**
