Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a string, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided string `s`.**
