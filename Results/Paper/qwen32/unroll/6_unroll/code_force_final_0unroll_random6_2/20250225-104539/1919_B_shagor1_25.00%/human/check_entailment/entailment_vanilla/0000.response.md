Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split the given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

The string `s` consists of characters `+` and `-`. Each `+` corresponds to `1` and each `-` corresponds to `-1`. We need to find an optimal way to split the array derived from `s` to minimize the total penalty.

### Key Observations

1. **Subarray Sum Penalty**: The penalty for a subarray is given by `|sum(subarray)| * len(subarray)`. To minimize the penalty, ideally, we want subarrays where the sum is `0` because `|0| * len(subarray) = 0`.

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to find the longest possible subarrays where the sum is `0`. If we can't achieve a sum of `0`, we should aim for the smallest possible absolute sum.

3. **Counting `+` and `-`**: The number of `+` and `-` in the string `s` determines how we can balance the subarrays. If the counts of `+` and `-` are equal, we can potentially split the array into subarrays with a sum of `0`. If they are not equal, we need to account for the imbalance.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

1. **Counting `-` Characters**: The program counts the number of `-` characters in the string `s`.

2. **Calculating Penalty**: The penalty is calculated using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`. This formula is derived from the observation that the penalty can be minimized by balancing the counts of `+` and `-`.

   - If `n == neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters. In this case, the penalty is simply `n` because we can't balance the array to have a sum of `0`.
   - If `n != neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` attempts to balance the counts of `+` and `-` to minimize the penalty.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `+`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: `n = 1`, `neg = 0`. The penalty is `1 - 2 * 0 = 1`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `-----`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: `n = 5`, `neg = 5`. The penalty is `5` (since `n == neg`).

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: `n = 6`, `neg = 3`. The penalty is `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `--+++++++`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `n = 10`, `neg = 2`. The penalty is `10 - 2 * 2 = 6` (This seems incorrect based on the expected output `4`).

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `n = 20`, `neg = 8`. The penalty is `20 - 2 * 8 = 4`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all test cases. Specifically, the formula `n - 2 * neg` does not always yield the correct result for all possible inputs. The optimal splitting strategy is more complex and involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach to balance the subarrays optimally.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all test cases. The formula used (`n - 2 * neg`) does not account for all optimal splitting scenarios.
Correctness: **False**
