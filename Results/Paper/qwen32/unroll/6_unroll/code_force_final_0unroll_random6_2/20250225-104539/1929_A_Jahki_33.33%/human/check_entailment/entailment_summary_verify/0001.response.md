Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment systematically.

### Problem Breakdown

The task is to find the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.

2. **Checking if the Array is Sorted:**
   - The `func_1` function checks if the array is strictly increasing. If it is, `func_1` returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True` (indicating the array is strictly increasing), the program prints `0`. This is incorrect because the beauty of a strictly increasing array is not necessarily `0`; it is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - If `func_1` returns `False` (indicating the array is not strictly increasing), the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Function Summary

The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is strictly increasing. This part of the program is accurate.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program is correct. However, there is a critical error in the logic:

- **Error in the `if` block:**
  - The program incorrectly prints `0` when `func_1` returns `True`. This is because the beauty of a strictly increasing array is not `0`; it is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Correctness

The program incorrectly handles the case when the array is strictly increasing. It should calculate the beauty even if the array is strictly increasing, not print `0`.

### Final Evaluation

Given the identified error, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
