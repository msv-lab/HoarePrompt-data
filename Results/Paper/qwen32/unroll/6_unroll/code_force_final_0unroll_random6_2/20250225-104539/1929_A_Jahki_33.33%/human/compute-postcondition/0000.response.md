The code snippet provided initializes a variable `order` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, or `num2`. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` (i.e., `num2` == `n`), and `order` is 0.**
