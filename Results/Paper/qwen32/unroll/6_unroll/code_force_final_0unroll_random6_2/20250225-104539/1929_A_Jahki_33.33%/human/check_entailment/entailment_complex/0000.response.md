### Reasoning:

The program aims to compute the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be maximized, leading to the highest possible sum of these differences.

The provided program follows this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It checks if the array is already strictly increasing using the function `func_1`.
4. If the array is strictly increasing, it prints `0` (which is incorrect because the beauty should be calculated even if the array is already in increasing order).
5. If the array is not strictly increasing, it sorts the array in ascending order, calculates the beauty, and prints it.

However, there is a flaw in the provided program:
- The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is strictly increasing, and if it is, the program incorrectly prints `0`. Instead, it should calculate the beauty even if the array is already sorted because the beauty is the sum of the differences, which is valid regardless of the initial order.

### Correctness:

Given the flaw in the logic where the program prints `0` for strictly increasing arrays, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
