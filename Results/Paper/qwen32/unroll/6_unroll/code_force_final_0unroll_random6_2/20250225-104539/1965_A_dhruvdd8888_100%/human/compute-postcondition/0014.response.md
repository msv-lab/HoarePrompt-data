The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state describes several variables (`nums`, `ls`, `nw`, and `cw`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `nums` is a list where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `1`.
- `ls` is calculated as `len(nums) - 1`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `nw` is `True`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `cw` is `False`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Bob'`, the values of the variables do not influence the output.

Output: **Bob**
