Let's analyze the loop to determine the final state of the variables.

The initial state is:
- `nums` is a list where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `1`.
- `ls` is `len(nums) - 1`.
- `nw` is `True`.
- `cw` is `True`.

The loop iterates from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1`.

Let's break down the loop:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nw` starts as `True`.
   - `cw` starts as `True`.

2. **First Iteration (i = len(nums) - 2):**
   - `nums[i]` is `1` (since all elements except the first are `1`).
   - `cw = not nw` → `cw = not True` → `cw = False`.
   - `nw = cw` → `nw = False`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations (i = len(nums) - 3 to 1):**
   - For each iteration, `nums[i]` is `1`.
   - `cw = not nw` → Since `nw` was `False` in the previous iteration, `cw = not False` → `cw = True`.
   - `nw = cw` → `nw = True`.

After the loop completes:
- `nw` will be `True` (from the last iteration where `cw` was `True`).
- `cw` will be `True` (from the last iteration).

The other variables (`nums` and `ls`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`nums` is a list where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `1`; `ls` is `len(nums) - 1`; `nw` is `True`; `cw` is `True`.**
