The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the input integers `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers. The calculation involves finding a maximum sum of a subarray under certain conditions, applying a transformation involving `k`, and then taking the result modulo 1,000,000,007.
