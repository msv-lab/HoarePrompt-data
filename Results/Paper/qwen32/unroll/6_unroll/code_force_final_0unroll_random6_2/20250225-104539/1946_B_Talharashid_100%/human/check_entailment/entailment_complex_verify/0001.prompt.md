You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case has been processed, and the results have been printed. The variables n, k, l, c, and maxi do not retain any specific values as they are local to each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the input integers `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `n` integers. The calculation involves finding a maximum sum of a subarray under certain conditions, applying a transformation involving `k`, and then taking the result modulo 1,000,000,007.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
2. It reads the array `l` of `n` integers.
3. It calculates a variable `c` (cumulative sum) and `maxi` (maximum cumulative sum encountered).
4. It iterates through the array, updating `c` and `maxi` based on the current element.
5. It computes the final result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` and prints it.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Sum of Subarray**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum sum of a subarray using a variable `maxi` and a cumulative sum `c`. However, this is not the correct approach for finding the maximum sum of any subarray (which can be found using Kadane's algorithm).
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum subarray sum can be negative. It also does not consider the possibility of using the entire array as the subarray to maximize the sum.

2. **Incorrect Formula**:
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` does not correctly represent the logic for maximizing the sum after `k` operations. The correct approach involves doubling the maximum subarray sum `k` times and adding it to the original sum of the array.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Find the Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the array `l`.

2. **Compute the Result**:
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert this sum into the array. After `k` operations, the sum of the array will be `original_sum + (2^k - 1) * max_subarray_sum`.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is zero or negative, the optimal strategy is to insert zeros (empty subarrays), and the sum of the array will remain `original_sum`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The calculation of the maximum subarray sum and the formula to compute the result are incorrect.
