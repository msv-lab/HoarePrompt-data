Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem. The code includes three functions, but only the first two (`func_1` and `func_2`) are partially implemented, and the third function (`func_3`) is not even started. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incomplete Logic**: The problem requires performing exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
2. **Missing Implementation**: The third function `func_3`, which should handle the core logic of performing the operations and calculating the maximum possible sum, is not implemented.
3. **Incorrect or Incomplete Functions**:
   - `func_1` correctly implements the modulo operation.
   - `func_2` seems to be attempting to find the maximum sum subarray (similar to Kadane's algorithm), but it does not handle all edge cases and does not return the correct data structure or values needed for the subsequent operations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Find the maximum sum subarray.
- Use this subarray to perform the operations in a way that maximizes the total sum.
- Perform exactly `k` operations.
- Return the maximum sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the third function is missing and the second function is incomplete, the program cannot be considered correct. Additionally, the current implementation does not handle the requirement of performing exactly `k` operations.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
