Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes three functions:
1. **func_1(number)**: This function returns the given number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
2. **func_2(arr)**: This function seems to be intended to find the maximum sum subarray within the given array `arr`. It initializes several variables and iterates through the array to find the maximum sum subarray and its endpoints.
3. **func_3(number, quantity)**: This function is incomplete and doesn't seem to perform any action.

### Key Points:
- The problem requires us to perform `k` operations to maximize the sum of the array.
- The best strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum sum subarray to the array, as this will maximize the sum.
- The maximum sum subarray can be found using Kadane's algorithm, which is a well-known approach for this problem.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incomplete Functionality**: `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform any action. It should handle the logic of performing `k` operations.
2. **Incorrect Implementation**: `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum subarray, but it has logical errors. It does not correctly handle cases where the maximum sum subarray is at the beginning or end of the array, and it does not handle arrays with all negative numbers correctly.
3. **Lack of Main Logic**: The program lacks the main logic to perform the operations and compute the final result.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct as it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it lacks the main logic to perform the operations and compute the final result, and `func_2` has logical errors.

**Correctness: False**
