Output State: **The program returns `max_segment` if `max_segment` has more than one element.**

To break this down:
- `max_segment` is defined as `[sum of all elements in arr, starting index of the first non-negative number or 0]`.
- If `max_segment` contains more than one element, the program will return `max_segment`. 
- This means the return value will be a list with at least two elements: the sum of all elements in `arr` and the starting index of the first non-negative number in `arr`, or 0 if there are no non-negative numbers.
