The function takes a list `arr` of integers, each between 1 and 500, and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in `arr`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
