To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the given loop step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cur_arr`: List of non-negative integers.
   - `bit`: An integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30 and `bit` is not equal to -1.
   - `new_arr`: An empty list.
   - `xor`: Initialized to 0.
   - `thing1`: Initialized to 0 (though `thing1` is not used in the loop, it remains unchanged).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `cur_arr`.
   - For each `i`, it updates `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `i` (`xor ^= i`).
   - It then checks if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0 (`if not xor >> bit & 1`):
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, it appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.

3. **Output State**:
   - `cur_arr`: Remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it.
   - `bit`: Remains unchanged as it is only used for checking.
   - `new_arr`: Contains the values of `xor` at the points where the `bit`-th bit of `xor` was 0, and these values were appended to `new_arr`.
   - `xor`: After the loop, `xor` will be the result of XORing all elements in `cur_arr` that did not lead to a reset of `xor` (i.e., those that did not have the `bit`-th bit as 0).
   - `thing1`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Hence, the output state is:

Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, new_arr is a list of xor values where the bit-th bit was 0, xor is the result of XORing elements that did not reset xor, thing1 is 0.**
