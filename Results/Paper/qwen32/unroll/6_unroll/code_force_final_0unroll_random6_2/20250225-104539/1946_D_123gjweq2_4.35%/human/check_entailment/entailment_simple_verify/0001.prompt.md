You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem's requirements step by step:

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the maximum number of segments `k` in an array `a` such that:
  - The first segment starts at index 1.
  - The last segment ends at index `n`.
  - Consecutive segments are contiguous in the array.
  - The bitwise OR of all segment XORs is less than or equal to `x`.

### Program Analysis:

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `find_max`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what each function is supposed to do and how they interact:

1. **Function `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max` with the array `arr` and the highest bit position (31) since the maximum value of `x` can be `2^30 - 1`, which fits within 30 bits.

2. **Function `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - **Base Case**: When `bit` is -1, it means we have considered all bits, and the function returns the length of the current array, implying that all segments are valid.
   - **New Array Creation**: It initializes an empty list `new_arr` and a variable `xor` to 0. It iterates through `cur_arr`, computing the cumulative XOR of elements. When the XOR value for the current segment does not have the bit at position `bit` set, it appends the XOR to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
   - **Handling Remaining XOR**: After the loop, if the remaining `xor` has the bit at position `bit` set, `thing1` is set to -1, indicating that the current segmentation is invalid. Otherwise, `thing1` is set to the result of a recursive call to `find_max` with `new_arr` and the next lower bit.
   - **Decision Making**: If the bit at position `bit` in `x` is set, the function returns the maximum of two values:
     - The result of a recursive call to `find_max` with `cur_arr` and the next lower bit.
     - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of valid segments found so far.
   - If the bit at position `bit` in `x` is not set, the function returns `thing1`, which is either the result of the recursive call with `new_arr` or -1.

### Evaluation:
- The program uses a bit-manipulation approach to determine the maximum number of segments by considering each bit position from the highest to the lowest.
- It checks if the cumulative XOR of segments can be broken down such that the bitwise OR of all segment XORs is less than or equal to `x`.
- The recursive approach ensures that all possible segmentations are considered, and the maximum valid `k` is found.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output for the given examples.
