The code snippet provided is `thing1 = 0`. This line initializes the variable `thing1` to 0. None of the other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30 and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.**
