Functionality: **The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` such that 0 <= bit < 30. It recursively processes the list to determine a maximum length based on specific bit conditions. If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. Otherwise, it filters `cur_arr` to create `new_arr` based on the `bit`-th bit and recursively calculates the maximum length, considering the length of `new_arr` and the results of further recursive calls.**
