Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The robot needs to move from cell (1, 1) to cell (2, n). The robot moves in two steps each second:
1. It can move left, right, down, or up (but not outside the grid).
2. It moves according to the arrow in the cell it ends up in after its move.

The key observation is that to reach (2, n) from (1, 1), the robot must eventually move down to row 2 and then move right to column n. The direction of the arrows in the grid must allow for such a path.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks only the second-to-last cell in the second row (cell (2, n-1)) for an arrow pointing left (`<`). If it finds an arrow pointing left, it outputs "No", otherwise, it outputs "Yes".

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Simplistic Check**: The program only checks one specific cell (2, n-1) for an arrow pointing left. This is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach (2, n) because the path to (2, n) depends on the entire grid configuration.
2. **Ignoring the First Row**: The program does not consider the arrows in the first row at all. The robot can move between rows, and the arrows in the first row can influence the robot's ability to reach (2, n).
3. **No Path Simulation**: The program does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid to verify if a valid path exists.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach (2, n). It fails to consider the full complexity of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
