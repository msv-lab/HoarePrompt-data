The function reads multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of times the intersection count of the first `m` elements of `a` with `b` is at least `k` as the elements of `a` are cyclically shifted.
