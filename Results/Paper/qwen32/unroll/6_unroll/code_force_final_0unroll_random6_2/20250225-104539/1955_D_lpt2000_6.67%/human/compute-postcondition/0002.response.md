To determine the output state after the execution of the loop, we need to analyze the operations performed within the loop and how they affect the variables.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)
```

### Explanation of the Loop:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input.
   - `aa` and `bb` are lists of integers read from the input.
   - `cnt_aa` is a counter for the first `m` elements of `aa`.
   - `cnt_bb` is a counter for all elements of `bb`.
   - `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`.
   - `E` is the difference of `cnt_aa` and `D`.
   - `C` is the difference of `cnt_bb` and `D`.
   - `tot` is the sum of values in `D`.
   - `fnd` is set to 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `aa` from index `m` to `n-1` using a sliding window approach.
   - For each element `in_aa` entering the window and `out_aa` leaving the window:
     - Adjust `D`, `E`, and `C` based on the elements entering and leaving the window.
     - Update `tot` to be the sum of values in `D`.
     - Increment `fnd` if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the sliding window, `fnd` is printed, representing the number of times the intersection count was at least `k`.

### Output State:
After all iterations of the loop, the state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged. The only variable that changes and is printed is `fnd`, which is the count of times the intersection count was at least `k` for each test case.

Output State: **The variable `fnd` holds the count of times the intersection count was at least `k` for each test case, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
