Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) â€” the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the corresponding string of length 5, but these values will not be retained outside the loop as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The variable `t` and the input strings remain unchanged.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: For each of the t test cases, `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the corresponding string of length 5, but these values will not be retained outside the loop as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The variable `t` and the input strings remain unchanged. If the current value of `ac` is greater than the current value of `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a distinct string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' and prints 'A' if 'A' appears more times than 'B', otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
