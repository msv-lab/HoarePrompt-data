Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error. The `if ac > bc: print('A') else: print('B')` block is outside the loop that processes each test case, so it only considers the counts from the last test case. Each test case should be processed independently, and the result for each should be printed within the loop.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

func()
```

This version correctly processes each test case independently and prints the result for each one.
