Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw. The variables `ac` and `bc` are initialized inside the loop that iterates over the test cases, but the comparison and print statements are outside the loop. This means that the comparison and print statements only use the values of `ac` and `bc` from the last test case processed. As a result, the program will always output the result of the last test case for all test cases, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would be to move the comparison and print statements inside the loop so that each test case is processed independently and the result for each test case is printed immediately after processing it.

Correctness: **False**
