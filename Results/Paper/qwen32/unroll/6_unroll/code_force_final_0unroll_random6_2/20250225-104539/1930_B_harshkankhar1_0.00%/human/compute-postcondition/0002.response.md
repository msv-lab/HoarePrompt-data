To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer read from the input such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list where elements at even indices are reversed compared to their original order, while elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
- The list `a` is described as having elements at even indices reversed compared to their original order, while elements at odd indices remain unchanged.
- However, the exact contents of the list `a` are not provided in the initial state. We only know the transformation rule applied to the list.

### Output Description:
Given the transformation rule, the output will be the list `a` after applying the described transformation:
- Elements at even indices will be in reversed order compared to their original positions.
- Elements at odd indices will remain in their original positions.

Since the exact original list is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical values of the elements in the list `a`. However, we can describe the structure of the list based on the transformation rule.

### Final Output:
Output: **a (where elements at even indices are reversed compared to their original order, while elements at odd indices remain unchanged)**
