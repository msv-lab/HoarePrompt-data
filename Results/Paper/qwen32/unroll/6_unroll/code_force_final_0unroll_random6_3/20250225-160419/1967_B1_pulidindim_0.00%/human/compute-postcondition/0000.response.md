`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After the code execution, `t` will hold the input integer value, and the constraints on `t` remain valid. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
