You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates and prints an integer value `ans` based on the provided `n` and `m`. The calculation involves iterating and updating a count and a value `g` until a certain condition is met, and the final result for each test case is printed as an integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

The provided program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\). For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\). It then initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\). The variable `ans` seems to be intended to store the count of valid pairs.

The while loop iterates as long as `count` is less than or equal to \(m\). Inside the loop:
- `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
- `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
- `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from it.
- `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
- `count` is incremented by 1.

Finally, the program prints the integer value of `ans`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:

1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The program initializes `ans` to \(n\), which is incorrect. The number of valid pairs when \(b = 1\) is not necessarily \(n\). The pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid if and only if \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), which is always true. So, there are \(n\) such pairs, but this is not the starting point for `ans`.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:** The logic inside the loop is incorrect. The loop is trying to count pairs for \(b \geq 2\), but the calculations do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each \(b\).

3. **Termination Condition:** The loop breaks when `g` is less than `countmins`, which is not a correct termination condition for counting valid pairs.

4. **Updating `ans`:** The update `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly reflect the number of valid pairs for each \(b\).

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), count the number of valid \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done by iterating over possible values of \(a\) and checking the condition.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
