Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the problem and the program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. The program then enters a loop where it calculates `countmins`, `g`, and updates `ans` based on these values. The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m`. The final value of `ans` is printed as the result for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the pairs where \(b = 1\). For \(b = 1\), all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) are valid pairs because \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\). Therefore, `ans` should be initialized to `n` only if \(m \ge 1\), but the program does not handle this correctly.
2. **Loop and Calculation Logic:** The loop and the calculations inside the loop do not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs. The program uses `g = n / count` and `g -= countmins` which do not relate to the problem's conditions. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked correctly.
3. **Handling of `b`:** The program does not correctly handle the value of `b` in the loop. It only considers values of `b` starting from 2, missing the case where \(b = 1\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, for each test case:
- For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
- Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
