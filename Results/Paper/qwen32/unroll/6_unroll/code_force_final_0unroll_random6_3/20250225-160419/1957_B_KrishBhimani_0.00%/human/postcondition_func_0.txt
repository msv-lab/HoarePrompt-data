The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates a list of `n` integers where the sum of the integers equals `k`. The integers in the list are the smallest possible powers of 2 that sum up to `k`, and if necessary, the list is padded with zeros to reach the length `n`. The function outputs this list for each test case.
