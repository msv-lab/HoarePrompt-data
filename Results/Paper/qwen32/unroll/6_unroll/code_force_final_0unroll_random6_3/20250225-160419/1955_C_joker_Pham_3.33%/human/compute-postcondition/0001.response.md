The code snippet provided initializes a variable `sunks` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n` - 1; `sunks` is 0.**
