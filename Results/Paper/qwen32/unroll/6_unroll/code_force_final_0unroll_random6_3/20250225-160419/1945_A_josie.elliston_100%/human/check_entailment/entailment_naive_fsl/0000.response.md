Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the case where there are not enough universals to pair with extroverts to form groups of three when the number of extroverts is not a multiple of three.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
0 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- There are 0 introverts, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal.
- The extrovert can share a tent with the universal, forming a group of 2.
- Since the extrovert is fine with any option, and the universal can also share, they can share a tent together.
- Thus, only 1 tent is needed.

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The function `func_1` is called with `extroverts=1` and `universals=1`.
- Since `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, which evaluates to `1 + 1 < 3` or `2 < 3`, which is true.
- Therefore, `func_1` returns `None`.
- `func_2` then returns `-1` because `ret` is `None`.

This example shows that the code does not correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of three but there are enough universals to pair with them to form valid groups of three. The code needs to be adjusted to correctly account for such scenarios.
