In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop iterates a number of times equal to the integer value obtained from `input()`. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is the input that will be provided to the loop, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
2. The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, so we do not need to adjust its state.
3. The state of `t` directly affects whether the loop will execute. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n` and `s`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`**
