You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: After executing all iterations, the program will have printed either 'Bob' or 'Alice' for each of the `test` test cases based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, respectively. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` will reflect the last iteration's values, and `test` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, and prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity (odd or even) of the sum of coins in both wallets. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game ends when both players cannot make a move, i.e., both wallets are empty.
   - The key observation here is that the player who starts (Alice) will win if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, and Bob will win if the total number of coins is even.
   - This is because if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the remaining coins are even, and vice versa. The game can be seen as a series of moves where the parity of the total coins dictates the winner.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob" (since Bob wins when the total number of coins is even).
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice" (since Alice wins when the total number of coins is odd).

3. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic derived from the game analysis.
   - It handles all edge cases, including when `a` and `b` are both 1 (Bob wins) and when `a` and `b` are very large (up to \(10^9\)).

Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner for all possible inputs, the correctness is **True**.
