The value of `test` is assigned the integer value of the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. Since `test` is now assigned the value of the input, it replaces `t` in the context of the problem. The other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still defined for each of the `test` cases.

Output State: **`test` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test` ≤ 1000, and for each of the `test` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**
