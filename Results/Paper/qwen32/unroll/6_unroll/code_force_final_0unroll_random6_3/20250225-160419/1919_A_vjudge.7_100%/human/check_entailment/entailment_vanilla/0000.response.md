To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns with a set of rules until one of them cannot make a move. The key points are:
1. Both players start with a certain number of coins in their wallets.
2. On each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
3. After choosing (or not choosing) to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The critical observation here is that the game is symmetric and deterministic. If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, then Bob will always win if both players play optimally. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win.

### Reasoning

The provided program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (a and b). It then checks whether the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd.

- If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

This logic is based on the observation that the parity (evenness or oddness) of the total number of coins determines the winner when both players play optimally. Here's the reasoning behind it:

- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always leave Bob with an odd number of coins after her move. Bob will then always leave Alice with an even number of coins. This pattern continues until Bob is left with 1 coin. Since Bob has to remove 1 coin, he will leave Alice with 0 coins, and Alice will not be able to move, making Bob the winner.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always leave Bob with an even number of coins after her move. Bob will then always leave Alice with an odd number of coins. This pattern continues until Alice is left with 1 coin. Alice will then remove the last coin, leaving Bob with 0 coins, and Bob will not be able to move, making Alice the winner.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
