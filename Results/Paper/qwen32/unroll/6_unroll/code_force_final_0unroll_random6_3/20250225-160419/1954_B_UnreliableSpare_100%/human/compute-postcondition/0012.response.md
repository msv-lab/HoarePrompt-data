Postcondition: **`t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `a` remains the same; `arr` remains the same; `flag` is `False` because not all elements in `arr` are the same; `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`; `val` remains the same; `cnt` is the count of the final sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val`.**
