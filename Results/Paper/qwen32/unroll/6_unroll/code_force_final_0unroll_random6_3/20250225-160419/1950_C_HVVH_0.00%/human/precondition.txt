times is a list of strings, where each string s is of length 5 with format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. The first element of the list is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) indicating the number of test cases, and the subsequent t elements are the test cases themselves. Each "hh" is a two-digit string from "00" to "23", and each "mm" is a two-digit string from "00" to "59".
