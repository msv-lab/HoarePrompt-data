In the given task, the for loop statement is:

```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `n` times, and `n` determines how many times the loop will execute.

Given the state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440.
- Each of the `t` test cases is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm".
- `day` is 'AM'.
- `n` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

The states `t`, `s`, and `day` are not directly related to the execution of the for loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; Each of the t test cases is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm"; `day` is 'AM'; `n` must be greater than 0**
