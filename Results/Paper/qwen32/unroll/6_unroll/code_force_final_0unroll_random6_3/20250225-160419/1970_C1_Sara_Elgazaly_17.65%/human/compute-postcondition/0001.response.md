The code snippet provided initializes a `defaultdict` with the key `list` as its default factory. This means that `lst` is now a dictionary where each key will have a default value of an empty list if the key does not exist in the dictionary. The other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree edges, `u_1`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the starting node for the single round is an integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**
