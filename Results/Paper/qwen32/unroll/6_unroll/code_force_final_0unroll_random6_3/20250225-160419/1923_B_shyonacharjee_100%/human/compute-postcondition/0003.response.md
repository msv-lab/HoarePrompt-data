Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and lists `a_i` and `x_i` with specific constraints. For each test case, it computes and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `x_i`. The function handles up to `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 30,000. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 300,000.**
