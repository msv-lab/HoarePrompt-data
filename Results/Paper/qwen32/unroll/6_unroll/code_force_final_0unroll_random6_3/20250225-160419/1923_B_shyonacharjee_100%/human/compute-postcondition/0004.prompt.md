You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n. x_i are integers such that -n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n and x_i != 0 for all 1 <= i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: For each test case, the output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, indicating whether it is possible to defeat all monsters with the given constraints. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` will not retain their values after the loop completes as they are local to each iteration. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases to be processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and lists `a_i` and `x_i` with specific constraints. For each test case, it computes and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `x_i`. The function handles up to `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 30,000. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 300,000.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
