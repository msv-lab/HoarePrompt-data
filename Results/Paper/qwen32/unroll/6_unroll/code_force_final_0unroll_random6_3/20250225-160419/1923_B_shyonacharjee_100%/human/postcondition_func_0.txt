The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of monsters with specific health values and positions, and a given number of bullets. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters using the bullets, considering the distance each monster is from the starting point and a given parameter `k` that affects the number of bullets needed per unit distance. The function outputs 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated and 'NO' otherwise.
