### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a robot can navigate from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) in a 2xN grid based on arrow directions. The robot's movement is governed by the following rules:
1. The robot can move left, right, up, or down (within the grid).
2. After moving, the robot must follow the arrow in the current cell.

The provided program simplifies the problem by only checking if the second last character of the second row is '<'. If it is, the program concludes that the robot cannot reach the target cell (2, n). This approach is incorrect because it does not simulate the robot's actual movement and arrow-following behavior.

Let's consider the provided test case:
```
2
4
>>><
>><<
```
Here, the robot can start at (1, 1) and follow the sequence of moves:
1. Move right to (1, 2).
2. Follow the '>' to (1, 3).
3. Move down to (2, 3).
4. Follow the '>' to (2, 4).

This shows that the robot can indeed reach the target cell (2, 4). However, the given program would output 'NO' because the second last character of the second row is '<'.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and arrow-following behavior. It only checks a single condition that is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
