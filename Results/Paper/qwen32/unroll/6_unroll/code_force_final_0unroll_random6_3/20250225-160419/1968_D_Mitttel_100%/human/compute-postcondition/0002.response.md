The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `p`, `s`, or `mx`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `cur` with the value 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n`, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`) where 1 <= `P_B`, `P_S` <= `n`, 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= `k` <= 10^9, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0.**
