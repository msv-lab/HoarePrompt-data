### Reasoning:
The provided program contains a significant logical flaw that affects its correctness. The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of trailing zeros in a number (given as a string), but it always returns `0` because of the incorrect placement of the `return` statement. This means that the `zeros` list will always be filled with zeros, and the subsequent logic that relies on this list will not work as intended.

The core logic of the program seems to be based on the assumption that by counting and handling trailing zeros, it can determine the winner of the game. However, since `func_1` does not correctly count trailing zeros, the program will not make the right decisions based on the number of digits and trailing zeros.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1`, which always returns `0`, and thus the logic that depends on the count of trailing zeros is flawed.
