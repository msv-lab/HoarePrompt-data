The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value does not need to be set explicitly before the loop starts, as the `range` function will handle it. However, to be clear, `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than 0**
