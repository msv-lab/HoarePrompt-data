Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function and the condition used to determine whether to print `0` or calculate the beauty. The `func_1` function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if so, it returns `True`. However, this condition is incorrectly used to decide whether to print `0`, which is not the correct approach.

The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in non-increasing order, not non-decreasing order. This is because the beauty is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and sorting in non-increasing order maximizes these differences.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    # Sort the array in non-increasing order to maximize the beauty
    b = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x - 1] - b[x]
    print(beauty)
```

In this corrected version, the array is sorted in non-increasing order, and the beauty is calculated accordingly. This change ensures that the program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case.
