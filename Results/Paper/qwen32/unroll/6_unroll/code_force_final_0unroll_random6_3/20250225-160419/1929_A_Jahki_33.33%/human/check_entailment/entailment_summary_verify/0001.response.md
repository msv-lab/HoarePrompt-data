Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to rearrange the elements of an array to maximize the beauty, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearrangement. The optimal way to achieve this is by sorting the array in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array in ascending order using `sorted(a)`. This step is correct as it ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The program calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements. This is the correct approach to calculate the beauty of the array.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing. It returns `True` if the array is strictly increasing and `False` otherwise.
   - The program uses `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in strictly increasing order. If it is, the program prints `0`, which is incorrect because the beauty of an already sorted array should still be calculated as the sum of differences, not `0`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The function `func_1` is not correctly used. It checks for strictly increasing order, which is not necessary for maximizing beauty.
- The program incorrectly prints `0` if the array is strictly increasing, which is not the correct behavior.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty for sorted arrays.
- However, the inclusion of `func_1` and its incorrect usage to print `0` for strictly increasing arrays is a flaw in the logic.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for calculating the beauty is correct, but the unnecessary and incorrect usage of `func_1` makes the original assessment partially accurate. Since the program does not handle all cases correctly due to the misuse of `func_1`, the program is not entirely correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program needs to be modified to remove the unnecessary function `func_1` and directly calculate the beauty for all cases.
