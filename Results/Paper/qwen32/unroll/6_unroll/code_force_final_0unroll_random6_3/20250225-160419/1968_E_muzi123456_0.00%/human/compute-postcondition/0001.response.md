In the given `while` loop, the loop condition is `while t:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is already stated to be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `t` will always be a non-zero integer. This means the loop condition `while t:` will always be `True` under the given constraints.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once. The state can simply be repeated as it is right before the loop.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50**
