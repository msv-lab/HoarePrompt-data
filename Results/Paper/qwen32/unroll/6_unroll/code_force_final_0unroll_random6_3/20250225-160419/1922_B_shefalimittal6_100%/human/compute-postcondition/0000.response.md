The provided code snippet only reads input from the standard input stream and assigns it to the variable `input`. It does not process or modify any other variables or the initial state provided. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `input` which holds the entire input from the standard input.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `input` holds the entire input from the standard input.**
