The code snippet provided splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Given the initial state, `input` holds the entire input from the standard input, which includes the number of test cases `t`, the number of integers `n` for each test case, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

After executing the line `data = input().split()`, the `data` variable will be a list of strings, where each string is a substring from the original input, split by whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the split input.**
