To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. These variables are unpacked from each tuple in the `test_cases` list. Therefore, the state of `test_cases` is the only thing we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `test_cases` contains at least one tuple.
- Each tuple in `test_cases` must be in the format `(n, x, y, arr)` where:
  - `n` is an integer satisfying `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
  - `x` and `y` are integers satisfying `1 <= x, y <= 10^9`.
  - `arr` is a list of `n` integers, each satisfying `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

### Adjustment:
To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple. For simplicity, we can define a single valid tuple that meets the criteria.

### Example Valid Tuple:
- `n` = 2 (minimum value for `n`)
- `x` = 1 (minimum value for `x`)
- `y` = 1 (minimum value for `y`)
- `arr` = [1, 1] (a list of `n` integers, each with the minimum value of 1)

### Adjusted State:
Given the above, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, e.g., `[(2, 1, 1, [1, 1])]`, `results` is an empty list**
