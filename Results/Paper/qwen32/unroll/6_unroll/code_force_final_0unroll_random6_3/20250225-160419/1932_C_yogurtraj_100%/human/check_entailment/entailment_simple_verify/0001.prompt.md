You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and see if it correctly implements the problem statement.

The program is supposed to:
1. For each test case, read the number of elements `n`, the modulo `m`, the array `a`, and the string of commands `t`.
2. For each command in `t`, compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` when divided by `m`.
3. Output these remainders in sequence.
4. Modify the array `a` according to the command ('L' or 'R') after computing the remainder.

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Initialization of `k`, `q1`, and `q2`**:
   - The program initializes `k`, `q1`, and `q2` based on the last command. This is incorrect because the first remainder should be calculated before any commands are executed.
   - The logic for initializing `k`, `q1`, and `q2` is flawed and does not correctly reflect the initial product of all elements in the array.

2. **Calculation of remainders**:
   - The program calculates the remainders in reverse order (from the last command to the first). This is incorrect because the problem statement requires the remainders to be calculated in the order of the commands.
   - The logic for updating `k` is incorrect. It should start with the product of all elements and then update it based on the commands, but the program's logic does not achieve this.

3. **Updating the array**:
   - The program does not correctly update the array `a` according to the commands. It uses indices `q1` and `q2` to track the elements to be multiplied, but these indices are not correctly updated.
   - The program does not actually remove elements from the array `a` as required by the problem statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the remainders in reverse order, which is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
