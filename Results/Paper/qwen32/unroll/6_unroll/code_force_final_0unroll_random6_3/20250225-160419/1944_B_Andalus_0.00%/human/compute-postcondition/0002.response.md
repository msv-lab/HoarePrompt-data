Output State: **The output state consists of T test cases, each producing two lines of output. For each test case, the first line contains up to k integers selected from the left half (lft) and the right half (rgt) of the input list `lst`, prioritizing pairs of identical integers from each half. If there are not enough pairs to reach k integers, single integers from the left half are added until k integers are reached. The second line follows the same logic but exclusively uses integers from the right half (rgt). The state of variables `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `lst` remains unchanged after each iteration of the loop, except for the temporary variables `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` which are recalculated for each test case.**
