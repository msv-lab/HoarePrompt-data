To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze if the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and examples.

The game rules can be summarized as follows:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

Based on the provided examples and the logic in the program, we can infer the following:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins because any move Alice makes can be mirrored by Bob, leading to Bob's win.
- If `a == 1`, Alice wins because she can swap and then Bob will be left with `a == 0` and `b == 1`, causing Bob to lose on his turn.
- If `b == 1`, Bob wins because Alice can only swap, leaving Bob with `a == 1` and `b == 0`, causing Alice to lose on her turn.
- If `a % 2 == 1`, Bob wins because Alice can always swap to make the number of coins in her wallet even, forcing Bob into a losing position.
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Alice wins because she can keep her wallet and force Bob into an odd number of coins, leading to a losing position for Bob.
- If `a > b`, Bob wins because he can always swap to make the number of coins in his wallet greater than or equal to Alice's, leading to a winning position for him.
- Otherwise, Alice wins.

Let's analyze the provided program against these rules:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

The program correctly implements the logic for the first four conditions:
- `a == b` → Bob wins.
- `a == 1` → Alice wins.
- `b == 1` → Bob wins.
- `a % 2 == 1` → Bob wins.

However, the remaining conditions are not correctly handled:
- `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` → Alice wins.
- `a > b` → Bob wins.
- `else` → Alice wins.

The issue lies in the last two conditions. Specifically:
- `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` is correctly handled.
- `a > b` should lead to Bob winning, but the program does not correctly handle all cases where `a > b` and `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`. For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 2`, Alice should win (not Bob as per the program).

The correct handling should be:
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0` and `a > b`, Alice wins.
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0` and `a < b`, Bob wins.
- If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0` and `a == b`, Bob wins (already handled).

Thus, the program is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the conditions for `a > b` when both `a` and `b` are even.

Correctness: **False**
