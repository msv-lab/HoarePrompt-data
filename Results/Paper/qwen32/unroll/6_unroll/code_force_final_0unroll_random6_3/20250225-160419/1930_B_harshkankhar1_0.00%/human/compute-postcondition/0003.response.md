Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`. The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the permutation `p` for each test case.**
