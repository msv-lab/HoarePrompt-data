The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements of the list `a` that are at even indices. Here's the impact on the list `a`:

- The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed.
- The elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n.

After executing the code, the elements at even indices of `a` will be in reverse order, while the elements at odd indices will remain the same.

Output State: **Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list where the elements at even indices are reversed, and the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.**
