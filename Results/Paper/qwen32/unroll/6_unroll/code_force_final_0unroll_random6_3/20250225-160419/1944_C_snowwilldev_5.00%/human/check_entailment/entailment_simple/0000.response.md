Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to a new array `c` (Alice does this) or just removing them from `a` (Bob does this). The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after all elements are removed from `a`, with Alice aiming to maximize the MEX and Bob aiming to minimize it.

### Key Observations
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to add elements to `c` that delay the occurrence of smaller integers.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to remove elements that would allow Alice to add smaller integers to `c`.

### Strategy
- The MEX of `c` at the end of the game will be determined by which numbers are added to `c` and in what order.
- The critical point is the smallest number that is not present in `c` after all elements are processed.
- If a number appears only once in `a`, it is a candidate for being added to `c` by Alice.
- If two such numbers exist, Alice can ensure that `c` will contain at least two distinct numbers, thus making the MEX at least 2.
- If no such number exists (i.e., every number appears at least twice), then Bob can ensure that the MEX is 0 by removing all instances of 0, or 1 if all 0s are removed but 1s remain, and so on.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows the logic described above:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
3. It counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
4. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N-1` and checks:
   - If a number appears exactly once in `a`, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or the number does not appear in `a` at all, it prints the current number and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness
The logic of the program correctly identifies the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It ensures that if there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, Alice can force the MEX to be at least 2. Otherwise, Bob can minimize the MEX to the smallest number not present in `a`.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
