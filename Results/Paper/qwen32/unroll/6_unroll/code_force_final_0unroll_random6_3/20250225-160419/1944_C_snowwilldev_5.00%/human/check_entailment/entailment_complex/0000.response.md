### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been moved to `c` following the rules of the game.
2. **Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and moving them to `c`.
   - Alice starts first.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

#### Strategy:
- If an integer appears exactly once in `a`, it will be in `c` because Alice can always pick it and Bob can't remove it from `c`.
- If an integer appears more than once in `a`, Bob can always ensure it is not in `c` by picking it after Alice.
- Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that either appears exactly once in `a` or does not appear at all in `a`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
2. **Counting Elements**: It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
3. **Determining MEX**: It iterates through the integers from `0` to `n-1` and checks:
   - If an integer appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or the integer does not appear at all (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints the integer `i` and breaks the loop.

#### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` such that either `i` appears exactly once in `a` or `i` does not appear at all in `a`.
- This integer `i` is the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.
- The logic aligns with the strategy derived from the problem analysis.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
