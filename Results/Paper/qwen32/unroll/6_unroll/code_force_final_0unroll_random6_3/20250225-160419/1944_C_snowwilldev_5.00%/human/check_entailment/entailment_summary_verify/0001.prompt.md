You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`. It then determines and prints the smallest integer `i` such that either `i` appears exactly once in the list `a` or `i` does not appear at all in the list `a`. If there are at least two such integers, it prints the first one it encounters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Both players play optimally to maximize or minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
2. **Turns**: Alice goes first, then Bob, and they alternate turns.
3. **Moves**:
   - Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
4. **End Condition**: The game ends when `a` is empty.
5. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`.

### Strategy:
- **Alice's Goal**: Maximize MEX.
- **Bob's Goal**: Minimize MEX.

### Key Observations:
- If an element appears exactly once in `a`, it will be in `c` at the end of the game.
- If an element appears more than once, it will be in `c` if Alice picks it and not if Bob picks it.
- The MEX is the smallest number not in `c`.

### Optimal Strategy:
- Alice should ensure that the smallest possible numbers are in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- Bob should try to prevent the smallest numbers from being in `c` to minimize the MEX.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Count Elements**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
2. **Determine MEX**:
   - It iterates through numbers from `0` to `N-1`.
   - It increments a counter `t` for each number that appears exactly once in `a`.
   - It breaks and prints the current number `i` if `t` is at least `2` or if the count of `i` is `0`.

### Correctness Check:
- The program aims to find the smallest number `i` such that either:
  - It appears exactly once in `a` (indicating it will be in `c`).
  - It does not appear in `a` at all.
- This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal moves of both players. The program does not simulate the turns or account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```
- For the first test case, the program outputs `2`, which is correct.
- For the second test case, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` (since MEX of `[0,1,2,3]` is `4`, but the program does not correctly simulate the game).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
