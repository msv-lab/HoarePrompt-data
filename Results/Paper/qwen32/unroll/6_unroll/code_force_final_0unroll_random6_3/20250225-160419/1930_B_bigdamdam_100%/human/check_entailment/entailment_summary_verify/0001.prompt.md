You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`. For each test case, it constructs and prints a list `p` of length `n` such that the even indices are filled with descending values starting from `n`, and the odd indices are filled with ascending values starting from `1 + n % 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires generating a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Program Analysis:
The given program aims to generate such a permutation by following these steps:
1. **Initialization**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
2. **First Loop (for even indices)**: It fills the permutation array \( p \) with the largest numbers first, starting from the last index and moving towards the first index, but only for even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
3. **Second Loop (for odd indices)**: It fills the remaining indices (odd indices) with the remaining numbers, starting from 1 or 2, depending on whether \( n \) is odd or even, and moving towards the end of the array.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `4`
- **Process**:
  - First Loop (even indices): \( p = [4, 0, 2, 0] \) (ind = 2)
  - Second Loop (odd indices): \( p = [4, 1, 2, 3] \) (ind = 3)
- **Output**: `4 1 2 3`
- **Validation**: 
  - Check pairs (1, 3): \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
  - Check pairs (2, 4): \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_5 \) (out of bounds).
- **Conclusion**: The permutation satisfies the condition.

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `3`
- **Process**:
  - First Loop (even indices): \( p = [3, 0, 1] \) (ind = 1)
  - Second Loop (odd indices): \( p = [3, 1, 2] \) (ind = 2)
- **Output**: `3 1 2`
- **Validation**:
  - Check pairs (1, 2): \( p_1 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
- **Conclusion**: The permutation satisfies the condition.

### General Analysis:
The program's approach ensures that no two consecutive numbers in the permutation have a divisor relationship with any other two consecutive numbers. This is achieved by placing the largest numbers at even indices and the smallest numbers at odd indices, which minimizes the chances of a divisor relationship between consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program generates valid permutations for the given problem constraints.
