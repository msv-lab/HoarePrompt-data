### Reasoning:

The provided Python program generates a permutation for each test case by filling the even indices in descending order starting from `n` and the odd indices in ascending order starting from `1 + n % 2`. Let's analyze if this approach satisfies the condition of the problem.

The condition of the problem states that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `1 ≤ i, j < n`, `i ≠ j`) such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

Let's consider how the program constructs the permutation `p`:
- Even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are filled with values in descending order from `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., down to `2` or `1` depending on whether `n` is even or odd.
- Odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) are filled with values in ascending order starting from `1` or `2` (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) up to `n-1` or `n` (again depending on the parity of `n`).

Given this construction:
- The largest values are placed at even indices, and the smallest values are placed at odd indices.
- Since the even-indexed values are in descending order and the odd-indexed values are in ascending order, no even-indexed value can divide a larger even-indexed value, and no odd-indexed value can divide a larger odd-indexed value.
- Furthermore, an even-indexed value cannot divide an odd-indexed value or vice versa, because the smallest odd-indexed value is at least `1 + n % 2` and the largest even-indexed value is `n`.

Thus, the constructed permutation `p` ensures that no two adjacent elements in `p` will have the property that one divides the other and the next element in `p` also divides the next element in `p`. Therefore, the program correctly constructs a valid permutation for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
