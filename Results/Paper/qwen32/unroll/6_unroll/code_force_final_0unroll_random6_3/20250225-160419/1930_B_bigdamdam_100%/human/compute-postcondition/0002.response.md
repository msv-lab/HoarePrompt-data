Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The sum of all `n` across the test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the value of `n`.**
