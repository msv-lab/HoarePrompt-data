Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program seems to be trying to find a subarray that, when replaced by its MEX value, maximizes the sum. However, the logic for finding such a subarray is flawed and does not guarantee the correct result. 

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Operation Generation**: The function `func_2` recursively generates operations in a way that does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum. It also does not consider the MEX value correctly.

3. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not calculate the MEX value of any subarray correctly. The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, which is not computed anywhere in the program.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already optimal or when the array contains only zeros.

5. **No Guarantee of Correctness**: The program does not provide any guarantee that the maximum sum will be achieved with the operations generated.

To solve this problem correctly, a more systematic approach is needed, such as iterating through all possible subarrays, calculating their MEX values, and performing the operations to maximize the sum. This approach should be efficient given the constraints (n â‰¤ 18).

Here is a more correct approach:

1. Iterate through all possible subarrays.
2. For each subarray, calculate its MEX value.
3. Perform the operation to replace the subarray with its MEX value.
4. Track the maximum sum achieved and the operations performed.

This approach ensures that the maximum sum is found and the operations are valid.
