### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine whether the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly choosing a subarray, computing its MEX (minimum non-negative integer not in the subarray), and setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX value. The operations should not exceed 500,000.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function is intended to find the subarray `[l, r]` that maximizes the sum after replacing it with the MEX value.
    - The current implementation calculates the sum as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This formula is incorrect because:
        - It does not compute the MEX value of the subarray.
        - It incorrectly assumes that the MEX value is `j - i + 1`, which is not the case.
    - The correct approach should involve calculating the MEX value for each subarray and then determining the new sum based on this MEX value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.
    - The current implementation is recursive and does not correctly handle the operations. It seems to be trying to set the subarray elements to the MEX value but in a way that doesn't match the problem's requirements.
    - The function recursively calls itself with `l - 1` and appends operations, but this does not align with the problem's logic for setting the MEX value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
    - This function is supposed to perform the operations and update the list.
    - The logic here is also incorrect. It appends operations and modifies the list but doesn't correctly calculate the MEX value or ensure the operations are minimal.
    - The function sets the subarray to `[n for _ in range(n)]`, where `n` is the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX value.

#### Example Case Analysis:
Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

The provided code does not correctly calculate the MEX value and the operations. It might produce incorrect operations that do not maximize the sum or do not follow the problem's constraints.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX value for subarrays and does not construct the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
