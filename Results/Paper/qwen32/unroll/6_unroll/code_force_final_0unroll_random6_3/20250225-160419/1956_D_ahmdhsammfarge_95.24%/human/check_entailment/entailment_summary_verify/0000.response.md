### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array by replacing subarrays with their MEX values.
- MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

#### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the best subarray `[l, r]` to replace with its MEX value.
   - The current implementation calculates the sum as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. 
   - The term `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is incorrect and should be replaced with the actual MEX value of the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function seems to be recursively constructing the sequence of operations to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the operations. It should ensure that the operations are minimal and correctly set the subarray to the MEX value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is supposed to perform the operations and update the list.
   - The logic here is incorrect. It appends operations and modifies the list but does not correctly calculate the MEX value or ensure the operations are minimal.

#### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the provided code does not correctly calculate the MEX value and the operations. It might produce incorrect operations that do not maximize the sum or do not follow the problem's constraints.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the MEX value for each subarray.
2. Determine the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX value, maximizes the sum.
3. Construct the sequence of operations to achieve this.

The provided code does not correctly implement these steps. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX value for subarrays and does not construct the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Final: **False**
