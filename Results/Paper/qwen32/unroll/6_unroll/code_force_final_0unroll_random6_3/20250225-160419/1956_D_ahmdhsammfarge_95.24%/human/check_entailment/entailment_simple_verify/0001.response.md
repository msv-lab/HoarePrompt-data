Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly choosing a subarray, computing its MEX value, and setting all elements in that subarray to this MEX value. The MEX value of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(lst)`:
- **Purpose**: Find the subarray `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum after replacing the subarray with its MEX value.
- **Logic**: The current implementation calculates the sum as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This is incorrect because it does not compute the MEX value. Instead of `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, it should compute the MEX of the subarray `lst[i:j+1]` and then calculate the new sum based on this MEX value.
- **Issue**: The formula `(j - i + 1) ** 2` does not represent the MEX value of the subarray, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

#### Function `func_2(r, l, ops)`:
- **Purpose**: Construct the sequence of operations to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.
- **Logic**: The function is recursive and seems to be trying to set the subarray elements to the MEX value but is not doing so correctly. It appends operations in a way that does not match the problem's requirements.
- **Issue**: The recursive calls and operations appended do not correctly reflect the operations needed to set the subarray to the MEX value.

#### Function `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`:
- **Purpose**: Perform the operations and update the list.
- **Logic**: It appends operations and modifies the list but does not correctly calculate the MEX value or ensure the operations are minimal.
- **Issue**: The operations appended and the list modification do not correctly reflect the operations needed to set the subarray to the MEX value.

### Annotated Code:
The annotated code provides a step-by-step explanation of the state of the program at key points, but it does not address the fundamental issues with the logic of calculating the MEX value and constructing the correct operations.

### Example Case Analysis:
Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
The provided code does not correctly calculate the MEX value and the operations. It might produce incorrect operations that do not maximize the sum or do not follow the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX value for subarrays and does not construct the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect based on the provided analysis and example case.
