### Reasoning:

#### Function Analysis:

1. **`func_1(lst)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To find the subarray `[i, j]` that maximizes the sum `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.
   - **Logic**: It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the sum as described. It keeps track of the subarray that gives the maximum sum.
   - **Correctness**: This function seems to correctly identify the subarray that maximizes the given expression.

2. **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To append operations to `ops` based on the indices `r` and `l`.
   - **Logic**: It recursively appends operations `[r + 1, l + 1]` and reduces `l` until `l` equals `r`.
   - **Correctness**: This function's logic is not clear in the context of the problem. It seems to be generating unnecessary operations and doesn't align with the goal of maximizing the sum.

3. **`func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To modify the list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a new sublist containing `n` elements, each equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the original sublist.
   - **Logic**: It appends operations to `ops` and then modifies `lst` as described.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly modifies the list `lst` and appends operations. However, the use of `func_2` within it is unnecessary and seems to add redundant operations.

#### Overall Program Analysis:

- **Goal**: To maximize the sum of the array `lst` by performing operations that replace subarrays with their MEX value.
- **Current Implementation**: The program correctly identifies the subarray to maximize the sum but uses `func_2` to generate operations that do not seem necessary for achieving the goal.
- **Redundancy**: The use of `func_2` leads to a large number of operations, which might exceed the limit of `5 * 10^5` operations. This is especially problematic given the constraints and the fact that the problem can be solved with fewer operations.
- **Output**: The program outputs the maximum sum and the operations, but the operations are not optimal.

### Conclusion:

While the program correctly identifies the subarray to maximize the sum and modifies the list accordingly, the use of `func_2` to generate operations is unnecessary and can lead to an excessive number of operations. Therefore, the program is not optimal and may not meet the problem's requirements in terms of the number of operations.

**Correctness: False**
