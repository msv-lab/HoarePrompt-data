Postcondition: **r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers; ops now contains an additional element [r + 1, l + 1]. If the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0, then this condition is identified.**
