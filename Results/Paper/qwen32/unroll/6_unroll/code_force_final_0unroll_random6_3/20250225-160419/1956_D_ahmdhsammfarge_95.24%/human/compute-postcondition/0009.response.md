Output State: **The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist from index `r` to `l` has been replaced with `[n for _ in range(n)]`, and `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`.**

This means that in the list `lst`, the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) have been replaced with `n` occurrences of the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the replaced sublist.
