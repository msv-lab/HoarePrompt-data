Output State: **r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers, and ops is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers; ops now contains an additional element [r + 1, l + 1].**

In simple terms, the variable `ops` has been updated to include a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]`, while the values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and the other elements of `ops` remain unchanged.
