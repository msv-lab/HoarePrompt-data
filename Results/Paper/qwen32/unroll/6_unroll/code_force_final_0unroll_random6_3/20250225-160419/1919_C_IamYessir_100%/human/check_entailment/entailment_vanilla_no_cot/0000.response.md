Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum possible penalty. The logic for splitting the array into subsequences `s` and `t` is flawed. The program attempts to split the array based on the comparison of the last elements of `s` and `t` with the current element, but it does not ensure that the resulting subsequences will yield the minimum penalty.

To solve the problem optimally, one can use a different approach. The key insight is that the minimum penalty can be achieved by splitting the array such that one subsequence is as "flat" as possible (i.e., it has the fewest increasing pairs), and the other subsequence takes the rest of the elements. A simple and effective strategy is to place all elements in one subsequence and then calculate the penalty for that subsequence. Since the penalty is the number of increasing pairs, the optimal solution is to place all elements in one subsequence and the other subsequence as empty, as the penalty for an empty subsequence is zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        penalty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if lit[i] > lit[i - 1]:
                penalty += 1
        print(penalty)

func()
```

This program calculates the penalty for the entire array as one subsequence and the other subsequence as empty, which is the optimal solution.
