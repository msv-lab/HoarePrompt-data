The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1` in place. This means that the order of the elements in `output1` is flipped, but the elements themselves remain the same. The other variables `x`, `n`, and `output2` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, with the order of elements reversed; `output2` is a list of divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
