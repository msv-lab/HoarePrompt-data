Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`. The list is structured such that the first part contains divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` in ascending order, followed by divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.**
