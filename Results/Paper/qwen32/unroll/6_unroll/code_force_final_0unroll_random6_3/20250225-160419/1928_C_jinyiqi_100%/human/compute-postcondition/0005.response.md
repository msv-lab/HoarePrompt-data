Output State: **The program returns a combined list of divisors of `x` where the first part contains divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` in ascending order, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.**

To break it down:
- `output2` contains divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- `output1` contains divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and these are in reversed order.
- The returned list is `output2` concatenated with `output1`, resulting in a list where the larger divisors come first in ascending order, followed by the smaller divisors in descending order.
