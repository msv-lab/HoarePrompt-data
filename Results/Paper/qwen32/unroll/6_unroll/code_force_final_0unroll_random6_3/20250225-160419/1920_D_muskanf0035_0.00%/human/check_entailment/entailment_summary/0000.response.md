### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it meets the requirements.

#### Problem Overview:
- We have an initially empty array `a`.
- We perform `n` operations in a specific order:
  - **Type 1 operation**: Append an integer `x` to the end of array `a`.
  - **Type 2 operation**: Append `x` copies of the entire array `a` to the end of `a`.
- After performing all operations, we answer `q` queries, each asking for the `k`-th element of the final array `a`.

#### Key Points:
- The array can grow very large due to Type 2 operations, which can append a large number of copies of the array.
- The queries can ask for elements at positions up to the size of the final array, which can be up to \(10^{18}\).
- The operations and queries are given in multiple test cases.

#### Analysis of the Code:

**Function `func_1`**:
- This function takes the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries.
- It processes each operation:
  - If the operation is Type 1, it appends the given integer to the array.
  - If the operation is Type 2, it extends the array by appending itself `x` times.
- After processing all operations, it answers each query by finding the `k`-th element in the array, using modulo operation to handle large indices.

**Function `func_2`**:
- This function reads the input, which includes the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
- It calls `func_1` to process the operations and queries and prints the results.

#### Issues:
- **Efficiency**: The current implementation of `func_1` is inefficient for large arrays. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` can lead to a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) or worse, as it repeatedly appends large arrays to the existing array.
- **Memory Usage**: The array can grow very large, potentially exceeding available memory, especially given that the size of the array can be up to \(10^{18}\).
- **Modulo Operation**: The function uses modulo operation to handle large indices, which is correct, but it doesn't address the underlying inefficiency.

#### Conclusion:
The current implementation is not efficient enough to handle the constraints of the problem, particularly the large size of the array and the number of operations. Therefore, while the logic for processing operations and answering queries is correct, the program as a whole is not correct due to performance issues.

**Correctness: False**
