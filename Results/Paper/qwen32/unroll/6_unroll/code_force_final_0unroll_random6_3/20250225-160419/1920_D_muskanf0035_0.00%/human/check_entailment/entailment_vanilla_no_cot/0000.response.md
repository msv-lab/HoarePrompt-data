Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to its handling of the second type of operation (appending x copies of the current array to itself). The program uses a loop to extend the array, which would result in a time complexity that is too high (O(n^2) at worst) and would not work within the given constraints.

### Explanation:
- **Operation 1**: Appending a single integer is handled correctly.
- **Operation 2**: The program uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` to duplicate the array `x` times, which is inefficient. For large `x` (up to \(10^9\)), this would lead to a timeout.

### Correct Approach:
Instead of duplicating the array in memory, we can keep track of the structure of the array using segments and their lengths. This way, we can determine the position of the queried element in the final array without actually constructing it.

### Example of a Correct Approach:
1. Use a stack to keep track of segments of the array and their lengths.
2. For each operation, update the stack accordingly.
3. For each query, trace back through the stack to find the actual element.

This approach ensures that the operations and queries are handled efficiently within the given constraints.
