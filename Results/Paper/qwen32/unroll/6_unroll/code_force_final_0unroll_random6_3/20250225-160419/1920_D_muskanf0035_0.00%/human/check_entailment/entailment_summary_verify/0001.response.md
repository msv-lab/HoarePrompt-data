### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues in the provided code and confirm why it is incorrect based on the problem constraints and requirements.

#### Problem Constraints and Requirements:
1. **Array Growth**: The array can grow exponentially due to Type 2 operations, potentially reaching up to \(10^{18}\) elements.
2. **Memory Limitations**: Storing an array of size \(10^{18}\) is infeasible.
3. **Efficient Query Handling**: The solution must efficiently determine the `k`-th element without constructing the entire array.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Type 1 Operations**: Correctly appends integers to the array.
   - **Type 2 Operations**: Attempts to extend the array by adding `x` copies of itself. This approach is incorrect because:
     - **Memory Overflow**: The array can grow exponentially, leading to memory overflow.
     - **Inefficient for Large `x`**: The code does not handle large `x` values efficiently, as it tries to create multiple copies of the array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Correctly handles input parsing and output formatting.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Memory Constraints**: The code fails to handle the memory constraints because it attempts to store the entire array, which can be up to \(10^{18}\) elements.
- **Efficiency**: The code does not provide an efficient solution for large `x` values in Type 2 operations.
- **Feasibility**: Given the problem constraints, a correct solution must avoid constructing the entire array and instead use a more efficient approach, such as tracking the structure of the array and using mathematical calculations to determine the `k`-th element.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it tries to construct the entire array, which is not feasible given the problem constraints. A correct solution would need to determine the `k`-th element without constructing the entire array, possibly by keeping track of the structure of the array and using mathematical calculations to find the required element.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
