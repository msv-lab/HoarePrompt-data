You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves performing operations on an array `a` of length `n` to construct a set `S` and then creating a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order. The goal is to find the lexicographically largest `b` possible.

### Key Points:
1. **Operations:**
   - Select an index `i` and insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
   - Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
   - Repeat the above two steps `n` times.

2. **Constructing `b`:**
   - `b` is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.

3. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - We need to maximize `b` lexicographically.

### Program Analysis

The provided program seems to follow a different approach compared to the straightforward method of inserting elements into a set and then sorting them. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - It modifies `a` in place such that each element `a[i]` is replaced by `a[i] + i + 1`.

3. **Creating a Set:**
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the modified `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates.

4. **Sorting:**
   - It sorts the unique elements of `a` in decreasing order.

5. **Constructing `b`:**
   - It constructs `b` by adding elements from the sorted unique elements, accounting for duplicates.
   - It handles the case where some elements need to be added to ensure the length of `b` is `n`.

### Correctness Analysis

The program's approach is correct in theory, but there are some nuances to consider:
- The program correctly modifies `a` to `a[i] + i + 1` and uses a set to ensure uniqueness.
- The sorting step ensures that the elements are in the correct order for `b`.
- The handling of duplicates and ensuring the length of `b` is `n` is also correct.

However, there is a subtle issue:
- The logic for adding duplicates and ensuring the length of `b` is `n` might not be optimal or might not handle all edge cases correctly.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where the same element is added multiple times due to the nature of sets and counters.

### Conclusion

Despite the program's logic being mostly correct, it might not handle all edge cases optimally, especially concerning the handling of duplicates and ensuring the length of `b` is `n`. However, based on the provided example and the general logic, the program seems to produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**

However, the program could be improved for clarity and robustness.
