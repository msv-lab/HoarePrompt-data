Let's break down the given code snippet to understand how the loop modifies the list `a`.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. During each iteration `i`, the value at index `i` in the list `a` is incremented by `i + 1`.

To illustrate this, let's take an example. Suppose the initial state is:
- `n = 5`
- `a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

The loop will execute as follows:
- For `i = 0`, `a[0]` is incremented by `0 + 1`, so `a[0]` becomes `11`.
- For `i = 1`, `a[1]` is incremented by `1 + 1`, so `a[1]` becomes `22`.
- For `i = 2`, `a[2]` is incremented by `2 + 1`, so `a[2]` becomes `33`.
- For `i = 3`, `a[3]` is incremented by `3 + 1`, so `a[3]` becomes `44`.
- For `i = 4`, `a[4]` is incremented by `4 + 1`, so `a[4]` becomes `55`.

Thus, after the loop finishes, the list `a` will be `[11, 22, 33, 44, 55]`.

Generalizing this, each element `a[i]` in the array `a` is incremented by `i + 1`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a`, and `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`.**
