The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `n` is positive. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`. It must be greater than 0. The list `a` and the integer `n` are already provided as part of the state, but `n` must satisfy the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`**
