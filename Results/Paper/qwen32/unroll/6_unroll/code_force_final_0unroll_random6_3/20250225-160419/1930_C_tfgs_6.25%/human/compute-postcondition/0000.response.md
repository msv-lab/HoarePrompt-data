Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array `a`.**

Natural Language: The variable `n` is now assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the length of the array `a`. The array `a` and its elements remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
