The code snippet `thing1 = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `thing1`. None of the other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` <= 29, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.**
