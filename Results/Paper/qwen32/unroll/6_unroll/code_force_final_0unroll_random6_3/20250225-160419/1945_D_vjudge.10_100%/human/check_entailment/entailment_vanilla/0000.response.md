Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the queue in reverse and calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position among the first m people. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. The function `func_1` is called with `pergunta` initialized to `float('inf')`, but this value is not returned or updated correctly to reflect the minimum cost for each test case.
2. The logic to calculate the minimum cost is flawed. The variable `x` is supposed to accumulate the cost of bribing people, but it is not reset for each test case, which could lead to incorrect results.
3. The condition `if i < m` is not correctly implemented for the problem's requirement. Kirill needs to be among the first m people, which means he can be at position m (1-based index) or less (0-based index). The condition should be `if i < m - 1` or `if i <= m - 1` depending on the indexing used.
4. The cost calculation `x += min(a[i], b[i])` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Kirill should only pay `a[j]` to swap with the person at position j and `b[k]` for each k such that j < k < i. The current implementation incorrectly adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x` for each person in the queue.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
