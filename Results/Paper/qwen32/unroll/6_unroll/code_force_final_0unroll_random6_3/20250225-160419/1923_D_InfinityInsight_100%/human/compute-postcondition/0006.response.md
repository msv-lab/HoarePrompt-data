Let's analyze the given loop and how it modifies the variables:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a`: List of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
   - `n`: Length of list `a`, representing the number of slimes.
   - `left`: List initialized with a single element `0`.
   - `last`: List where each element at index `i` is the index of the last different element in `a` up to `i`.
   - `ans`: List of length `n` with all elements initialized to `-1`.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for i in a:
       left.append(left[-1] + i)
   ```

3. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.
   - For each element `i`, it appends to the `left` list the sum of the last element in `left` and the current element `i`.
   - This means `left` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, starting with an initial `0`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `a`: Remains unchanged as it is only iterated over.
   - `n`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
   - `left`: Will be a list of cumulative sums starting from `0` and including the cumulative sums of `a`.
   - `last`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
   - `ans`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.

**Output State**: **a is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, n is an integer representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and len(a) == n, left is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in a starting from 0, last is a list where each element at index i is the index of the last different element in a up to i, ans is a list of length n with all elements initialized to -1**.
