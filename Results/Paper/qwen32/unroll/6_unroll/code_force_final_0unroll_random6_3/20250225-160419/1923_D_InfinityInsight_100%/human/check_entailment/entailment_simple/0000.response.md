### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or determining if it is impossible for a slime to be eaten. The code does this by considering two scenarios: the original order of slimes and the reversed order of slimes. It then takes the minimum time from these two scenarios for each slime.

Let's break down the code and its logic:

1. **Function `func_1(a, x)`**:
   - This function finds the smallest index `inx` in the list `a` such that `a[inx] > x`. If `x < 0`, it returns `-1`.
   - The function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the index efficiently.

2. **Function `func_2(a, n)`**:
   - It initializes `left` as a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0.
   - It initializes `last` as a list where each element at index `i` is the index of the last different element in `a` up to `i`.
   - It initializes `ans` as a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `-1`.
   - For each slime, it checks if it can eat its left neighbor. If it can, it sets `ans[i]` to 1.
   - If not, it calculates the cumulative sum up to the previous slime and uses `func_1` to find the smallest index where a slime can eat the current slime.
   - It also considers the last different element to ensure the correct index is chosen.
   - Finally, it updates `ans[i]` with the minimum number of seconds required for the slime to be eaten.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each test case, it calculates `ans` for the original order and the reversed order of slimes.
   - It then takes the minimum value from these two scenarios for each slime, or `-1` if it is impossible for the slime to be eaten.

### Correctness:

The code correctly handles the problem requirements by considering both the original and reversed orders of slimes. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to determine the minimum number of seconds required for each slime to be eaten or if it is impossible.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
