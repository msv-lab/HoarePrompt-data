To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

The given loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`. For each element `i`, it appends the sum of the last element in the `left` list and `i` to the `left` list. 

Initially, `left` is `[0]`. As the loop iterates over each element in `a`, it effectively calculates the cumulative sum of the elements in `a`, starting from 0. This means that after the loop finishes, `left` will contain `n + 1` elements, where the first element is 0 (the initial value) and the subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.

The variables `last` and `ans` are not modified in the loop body, so they remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the output state:

- `a` remains the same as the initial state.
- `n` remains the same as the initial state.
- `left` will be a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.
- `last` remains the same as the initial state.
- `ans` remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **a is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, n is an integer representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and len(a) == n, left is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in a starting from 0, last is a list where each element at index i is the index of the last different element in a up to i, ans is a list of length n with all elements initialized to -1**.
