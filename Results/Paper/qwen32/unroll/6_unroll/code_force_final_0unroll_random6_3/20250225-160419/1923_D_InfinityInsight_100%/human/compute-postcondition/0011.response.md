Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n` with elements updated based on specific loop conditions.**
