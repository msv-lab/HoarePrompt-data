### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it accurately computes the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or reports that it is impossible for a slime to be eaten.

Let's break down the provided functions and their roles in solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses the `bisect_left` method to find the insertion point for `x` in the sorted list `a`. If the element at this position is exactly `x`, it returns the position plus one; otherwise, it returns the insertion point.
   - This function is crucial for finding the closest slime to the left that could potentially eat the current slime.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.
   - It maintains a list `left` which contains the cumulative sums of the slime sizes, and a list `last` which keeps track of the last position where the slime size changed.
   - For each slime, if it is smaller than the previous slime, it can be eaten in one second, and the function sets `ans[i]` to 1.
   - If the current slime is not smaller than the previous slime, the function calculates the cumulative sum up to the previous slime (`x`), and uses `func_1` to find the closest slime to the left that could eat the current slime.
   - The function updates `ans[i]` with the number of seconds it takes for the current slime to be eaten.
   - The function handles cases where a slime cannot be eaten by setting `ans[i]` to -1.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by calling `func_2` on the original list of slime sizes and the reversed list of slime sizes.
   - It then combines the results from both directions to determine the final answer for each slime.
   - The results are printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program uses a combination of cumulative sums and binary search to efficiently determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.
- By considering both the original and reversed lists of slime sizes, the program ensures that it correctly handles cases where slimes can be eaten from either side.
- The use of `bisect_left` in `func_1` ensures that the search for the closest slime to the left is efficient.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem, including cases where a slime cannot be eaten.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided execution summaries and the analysis of the functions, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
