Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program calculates and prints `n - 2 * neg` if the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, or if there are more '+' characters than '-' characters, and `n` if the string contains only '-' characters. However, this logic does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty based on the rules provided.

The correct approach involves finding a way to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized. The provided solution does not attempt to split the array in any way and instead uses a simple formula that does not consider the optimal splitting strategy.

For example, in the third test case (`+-+-+-`), the correct output should be `0` because the array can be split into `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])`, each of which has a penalty of `0`. However, the given program would output `0` only because the number of '+' and '-' characters are equal, which is not the reason for the optimal solution.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
