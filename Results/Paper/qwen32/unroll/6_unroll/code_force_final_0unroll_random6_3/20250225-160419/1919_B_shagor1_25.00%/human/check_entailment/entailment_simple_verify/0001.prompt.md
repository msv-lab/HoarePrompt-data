You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string s. The string s consists of n characters, each of which is either '+' or '-'. There are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

            neg += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters; `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: - The output will be `n - 2 * neg` if the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, or if there are more '+' characters than '-' characters.
    #   - The output will be `n` if the string contains only '-' characters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`, where:
- `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'`
- `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`

The penalty for a subarray `c` is calculated as:
- `p(c) = |sum(c)| * len(c)`

The goal is to split `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties for all subarrays is minimized.

### Key Insight
The optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty involves forming subarrays where the sum is zero (`0`), as this would result in a penalty of `0`. If the entire array can be split into such subarrays, the total penalty will be `0`.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Counting '+' and '-'**:
   - The program counts the number of `'-'` characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - The number of `'+'` characters can be derived as `n - neg`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - If the number of `'+'` characters is equal to the number of `'-'` characters (`n == 2 * neg`), then it is possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of `0`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`.
   - Otherwise, the minimum penalty is `n - 2 * neg`. This formula essentially calculates the number of characters that cannot be paired to form a subarray with a sum of `0`.

### Verification with Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `s = '+'`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: `a = [1]`, cannot form a subarray with sum `0`, penalty is `1`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `s = '-----'`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, cannot form subarrays with sum `0`, penalty is `5`.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n = 6`, `s = '+-+-+-'`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, can be split into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, penalty is `0`.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `n = 10`, `s = '--+++++++-'`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`, can be split into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, penalty is `4`.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `n = 20`, `s = '+---++++-+++++---++-'`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `a = [1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`, can be split into multiple subarrays with minimal penalty, resulting in `4`.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the described strategy. It correctly handles all the test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
