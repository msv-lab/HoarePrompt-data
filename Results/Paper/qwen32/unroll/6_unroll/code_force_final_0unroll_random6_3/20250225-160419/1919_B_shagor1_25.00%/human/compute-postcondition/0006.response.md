Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`, and the string `s` itself, which consists of `n` characters, each being either '+' or '-'. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the content of the string `s`.**
