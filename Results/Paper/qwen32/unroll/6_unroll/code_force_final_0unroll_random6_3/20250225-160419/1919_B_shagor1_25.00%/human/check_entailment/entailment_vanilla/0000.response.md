Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split a string `s` consisting of `+` and `-` into non-empty subarrays in such a way that the sum of penalties is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

To minimize the penalty, we need to try to create subarrays with a sum of 0, as this will result in a penalty of 0 for those subarrays. If it's not possible to create subarrays with a sum of 0, we should aim to create subarrays with the smallest possible absolute sum.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does not implement an optimal algorithm for solving the problem. Here's a breakdown of what the program does:

1. **Input Reading**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Counting Minuses**:
    - It counts the number of `-` characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

3. **Calculating Penalty**:
    - It calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it calculates the penalty as `n`.

### Flaws in the Program

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
    - The program does not correctly calculate the penalty based on the problem's requirements. The penalty is not simply `n - 2 * neg`. It depends on how the array is split into subarrays with minimal penalties.

2. **No Splitting Logic**:
    - The program does not implement any logic to split the array into subarrays optimally to minimize the penalty.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to implement a dynamic programming approach or use a greedy strategy to split the array into subarrays with minimal penalties. Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum penalty for the first `i` elements of the array.
    - Iterate through the array and for each position `i`, try to end a subarray at that position and calculate the penalty for that subarray.
    - Update the `dp` table based on the minimum penalty found.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
    - Traverse the array and keep a running sum.
    - Whenever the running sum becomes zero, split the array at that point and add the penalty for the subarray to the total penalty.
    - If the running sum does not become zero, continue to the end of the array and add the penalty for the remaining subarray.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to optimally split the array and calculate the minimum penalty.

**Correctness: False**
