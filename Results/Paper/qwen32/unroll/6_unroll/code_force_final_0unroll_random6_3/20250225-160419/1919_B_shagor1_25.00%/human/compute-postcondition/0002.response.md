The code snippet provided initializes the variable `neg` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the value of `n` and the string `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters; `neg` is 0.**
