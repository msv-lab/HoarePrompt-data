Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen during k excursions. However, there are some issues with the logic and the implementation that make the program incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`:**  
   The line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is intended to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. However, the code mistakenly divides by `1` instead of `2`. This results in an incorrect value for `c`.

2. **Incorrect Accumulation of `s`:**  
   The loop `for i in range(k):` is intended to accumulate the sum `s` based on the expected value of the friendship values. However, the formula used inside the loop is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of picking a friend pair and the increase in friendship values over the excursions. The current implementation does not correctly reflect this logic.

3. **Incorrect Final Calculation:**  
   The final calculation of `s` inside the loop is incorrect. The expected sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs should be calculated based on the probability of picking a friend pair and the increase in friendship values over the excursions. The current implementation does not correctly reflect this.

4. **Misunderstanding of the Problem Requirements:**  
   The program does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values over the excursions. The friendship values of friend pairs increase by 1 each time they are chosen, and this increase should be considered in the expected value calculation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
