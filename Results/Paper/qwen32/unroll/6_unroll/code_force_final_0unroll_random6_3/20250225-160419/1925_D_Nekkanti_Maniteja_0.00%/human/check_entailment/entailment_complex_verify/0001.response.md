### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
- Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value, and if a pair is chosen as friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
   - `s` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

3. **Processing Friend Pairs:**
   - The program correctly iterates over the `m` friend pairs, adding their friendship values to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program then iterates `k` times, updating `s` in each iteration.
   - The formula used for updating `s` in the program is:
     ```python
     for i in range(k):
         s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
     ```
   - This formula is incorrect. The expected value should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the cumulative increase in their friendship values.

#### Correct Formula:
The expected value of the sum of friendship values can be derived as follows:
- The probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
- The expected contribution of a friend pair to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is:
  \[
  \text{Expected contribution} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \left(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot j\right) + \left(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot f_i\right) \cdot k
  \]
  where \(f_i\) is the initial friendship value of the pair.
- Summing over all friend pairs, the expected sum of friendship values is:
  \[
  \text{Expected sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left(\sum_{j=1}^{k} \left(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot j\right) + \left(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot f_i\right) \cdot k\right)
  \]
- Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  \text{Expected sum} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot m + a \cdot k\right)
  \]
- The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program uses an incorrect formula for updating the expected sum of friendship values. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
