You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. These represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively. Following these three integers, there are m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. These represent the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The final value of `s` for each test case is calculated as:
    #\[
    #s = \left( \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2} + a \cdot k \right) \% M
    #\]
    #
    #Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), and `k` (number of excursions). It also accepts `m` lines of three integers each, representing pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The function processes these inputs and returns the results of the excursions based on the friendship dynamics described.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
