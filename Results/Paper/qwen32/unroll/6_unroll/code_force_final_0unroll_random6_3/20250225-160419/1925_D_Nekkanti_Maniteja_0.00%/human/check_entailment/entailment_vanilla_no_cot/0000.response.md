Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Inverse**: The program calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. However, this inverse is not needed as the calculation of expected value does not involve taking the inverse of the total number of pairs directly in this context.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the sum `s` of the expected friendship values. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions should account for the fact that each friend pair's friendship value increases by 1 each time it is chosen. The current implementation does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over multiple excursions.

3. **Incorrect Loop for Sum Calculation**: The loop `for i in range(k):` is incorrectly structured. The program attempts to update the sum `s` in a way that does not reflect the expected value calculation correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        s = 0
        a = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        # Calculate the expected value
        # Each pair has a probability of m / total_pairs of being chosen
        # The expected value of the sum of friendship values is the sum of the expected values for each excursion
        expected_sum_per_excursion = a * m / total_pairs
        expected_sum = 0
        
        # The expected sum of friendship values over k excursions
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            expected_sum += expected_sum_per_excursion
            expected_sum_per_excursion += m / total_pairs
        
        # Convert to integer and take modulo M
        expected_sum = int(expected_sum) % M
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values over k excursions correctly by accounting for the increasing friendship values of the chosen pairs.
