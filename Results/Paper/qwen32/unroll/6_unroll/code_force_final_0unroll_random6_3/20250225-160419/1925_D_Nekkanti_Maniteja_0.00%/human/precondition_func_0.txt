The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. These represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively. Following these three integers, there are m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. These represent the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
