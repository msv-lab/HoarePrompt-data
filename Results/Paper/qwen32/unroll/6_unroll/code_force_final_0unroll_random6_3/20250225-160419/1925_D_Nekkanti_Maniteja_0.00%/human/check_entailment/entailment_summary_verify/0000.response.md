### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 each time they are chosen.
- The result should be given as `p * q^(-1) % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in its simplest form.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The probability `c` is calculated as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is incorrect because the total number of possible pairs of children is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - Therefore, `c` should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` attempts to calculate the expected value, but the formula used inside the loop is incorrect.
   - The expected value for each excursion should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and their current friendship value. The provided code does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over subsequent excursions.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. It seems to be trying to calculate the expected value but does not account for the dynamic increase in friendship values correctly.

3. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the scenario where a pair of children are not friends. The expected value should be 0 for non-friend pairs, and the code does not account for this correctly.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly compute the expected value:
- Calculate the probability of selecting a friend pair, which is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- For each pair of friends, calculate the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
- Sum these contributions to get the total expected value.
- Convert the expected value to the required modulo form.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
