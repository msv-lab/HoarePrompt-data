The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. The new segment is formed by concatenating `new_segment` with `[len(arr) - 1]`. Given that `new_segment` is `[5, 6]` and `len(arr) - 1` is an integer representing the last index of `arr`, the new segment added will be `[5, 6, len(arr) - 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [5, 3]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [5, 3, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1.**
