Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [5, 3]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [5, 3, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1; `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

Natural Language: The variable `total_max_segment` has been initialized to `[-1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
