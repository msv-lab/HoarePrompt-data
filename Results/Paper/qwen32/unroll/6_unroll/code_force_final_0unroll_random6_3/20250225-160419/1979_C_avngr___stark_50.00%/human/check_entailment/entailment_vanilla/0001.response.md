Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to distribute bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` on `n` outcomes such that the total bet `Σx_i` is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome `k_i * x_i` for `i = 1, 2, ..., n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - It calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`. This is a common multiple that can be used to determine the bets.

3. **Determining Bets:**
   - It then calculates the bets `c_i` for each outcome as `c_i = m / k_i`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the returned amount `k_i * c_i` equals `m`.
   - It calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all `c_i` values to simplify the bets while maintaining the ratio.
   - It divides each `c_i` by the HCF to get the simplified bets.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It checks if the sum of the simplified bets `Σc_i` is less than `m / HCF`. If this condition holds, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The core logic of the program is to find bets that satisfy the condition `Σx_i < k_i * x_i` for all `i`. By setting `x_i = m / k_i`, it ensures that `k_i * x_i = m` for all `i`. Simplifying the `x_i` values by their HCF does not change the ratio but ensures the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.
- The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect. The correct check should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` should actually be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf`, but the intention is to check if the total bets are less than the minimum return, which is `m / hcf`. However, the condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` is actually checking if the total bets are greater than or equal to the minimum return which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf / min(k)`, but since `m / hcf` is already the minimum return, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is correct as it stands because `m / hcf` is the minimum return for the simplified bets.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and outputs the bets or `-1` based on the feasibility of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets or determine that no such bets are possible.

Correctness: **True**
