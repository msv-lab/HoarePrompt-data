You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributing the bets based on the ratio of the LCM to each multiplier. However, the logic used to determine the bets and check if they meet the requirement is flawed.

Let's analyze the problem and the program:

1. **Objective**: For each test case, distribute the bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Specifically, if the i-th outcome wins, the amount received should be more than the total amount bet across all outcomes.

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - Calculate the LCM of the multipliers.
   - Distribute the bets as `m / k[i]` for each outcome, where `m` is the LCM and `k[i]` is the multiplier for the i-th outcome.
   - Normalize these bets by dividing them by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - Check if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. If not, print `-1`.

3. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not correctly checking the requirement. The requirement is that the total amount bet (`sum(c)`) should be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome (`k[i] * c[i]`).
   - The normalization step using GCD is unnecessary and does not affect the core logic of the problem.
   - The program does not correctly ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case with `n = 2` and `k = [2, 3]`.
   - The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6.
   - The bets would be `6 / 2 = 3` and `6 / 3 = 2`.
   - The total bet is `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - If the first outcome wins, the amount received is `2 * 3 = 6`, which is greater than 5.
   - If the second outcome wins, the amount received is `3 * 2 = 6`, which is greater than 5.
   - However, the program would check `sum(c) = 5` against `6 / 1 = 6`, which is correct, but the logic is flawed for more complex cases.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome. One such approach is to use the formula `c[i] = (m / k[i]) - 1` for each outcome, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers, ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome.

Given the flaws in the logic and the counterexample, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
