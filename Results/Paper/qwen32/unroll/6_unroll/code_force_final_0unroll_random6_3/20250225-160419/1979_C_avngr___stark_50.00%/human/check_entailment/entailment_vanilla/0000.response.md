Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute coins across `n` possible outcomes.
- For each outcome `i`, if it is the winning outcome, we receive `k_i * x_i` coins back, where `x_i` is the bet on that outcome.
- The total amount bet (`sum(x_i)`) should be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

### Program Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of outcomes `n` is read.
     - The multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are read.

2. **Finding a Suitable Distribution:**
   - The program calculates `m` as the product of all multipliers `k_i`.
   - It then calculates `c_i` as `m / k_i` for each `i`.
   - The greatest common factor (GCF) of all `c_i` is found.
   - Each `c_i` is then divided by this GCF to simplify the distribution.
   - The program checks if the sum of the simplified `c_i` is less than `m / hcf`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the simplified `c_i` values.

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - If the sum of the simplified `c_i` is less than `m / hcf`, it means that the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome, which satisfies the problem's condition.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) implicitly through the product `m` and then divides by each `k_i` to ensure the condition holds.
  - Simplifying by the GCF ensures that the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.
  - The check `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all `k_i` are the same, the program will output a single bet for all outcomes, which is correct.
  - If the sum of the simplified `c_i` is not less than `m / hcf`, it correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a suitable distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
