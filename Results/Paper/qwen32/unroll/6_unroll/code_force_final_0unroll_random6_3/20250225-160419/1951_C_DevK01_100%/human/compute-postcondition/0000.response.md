Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are as described in the initial state.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
