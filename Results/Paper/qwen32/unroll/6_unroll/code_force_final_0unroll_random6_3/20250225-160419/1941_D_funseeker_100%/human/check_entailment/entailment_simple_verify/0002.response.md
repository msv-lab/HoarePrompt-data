### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines efficiently, which is appropriate for handling large inputs.
   - The functions `func_2()` and `func_3()` are used to parse integers and lists of integers from the input, respectively. These functions work as expected and are correctly implemented.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`. This is correctly done using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set is used to keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw. This approach is sound because sets automatically handle duplicates, ensuring each possible position is unique.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If the direction `c` is `'0'` (clockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it calculates the new position as `(q + r) % n` and adds it to the `temp` set.
   - If the direction `c` is `'1'` (counterclockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it calculates the new position as `(q - r) % n` and adds it to the `temp` set.
   - The `temp` set accumulates all possible positions after the current throw and is then assigned back to `ans` for the next iteration. This logic correctly handles all possible directions for each throw.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` because the modulo operation can result in `0`, which corresponds to player `n` in a 1-based index system. This is a crucial step to ensure the output is correctly formatted.
   - The program prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of these positions. This is done correctly by printing `len(ans)` and `*sorted(ans)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of players who could have the ball and their sorted numbers, as required by the problem statement. The output format matches the requirement, and the logic ensures all possible positions are considered.

### Annotations:
The annotations provided describe the state of the program before and after key operations, confirming that the logic is correctly applied. The annotations also correctly identify the handling of the edge case where the modulo operation results in `0`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and reasoning. The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including the unknown directions of some throws and the edge case where the modulo operation results in `0`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
