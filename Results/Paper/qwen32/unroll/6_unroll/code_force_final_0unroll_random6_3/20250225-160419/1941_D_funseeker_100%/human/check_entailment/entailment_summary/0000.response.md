### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a line from standard input and returns it after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This matches the expected behavior as per the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads a line from standard input (using `func_1`) and converts it to an integer. This function is used to read the number of test cases `t`. This matches the expected behavior.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads a line from standard input (using `func_1`), splits it into substrings based on whitespace, and converts each substring to an integer. This function is used to read the values `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case. This matches the expected behavior.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function handles the logic for each test case. It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. It then iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball after each throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if the direction is unknown (`'?'`). The set `ans` keeps track of all possible players who could have the ball after all throws. After processing all throws, it adjusts for the case where the player number `0` should be replaced by `n` and then prints the number of unique players and their sorted identifiers.

### Evaluation of Correctness:

- **Initialization**: The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`, which is correct.
- **Processing Throws**: For each throw, the function correctly updates the set `ans` to include both possible new positions (clockwise and counterclockwise) if the direction is unknown. This ensures that all possible end positions are considered.
- **Handling Player Numbering**: If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n`, which is the correct handling of player numbering in a circular arrangement.
- **Output**: The function prints the number of unique players and their sorted identifiers, which matches the problem's output requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
