### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read a single line of input, which is a good practice for handling large inputs efficiently.
   - `func_2()` reads an integer from the input.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is useful for reading multiple integers in a single line.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If the direction `c` is `'0'` (clockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the `temp` set.
   - If the direction `c` is `'1'` (counterclockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the `temp` set.
   - The `temp` set is then assigned back to `ans` for the next iteration.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` because the modulo operation can result in `0`, which corresponds to player `n` in a 1-based index system.
   - The program prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of these positions.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of players who could have the ball and their sorted numbers, as required by the problem statement.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **Initialization:** The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`, which is correct.
- **Processing Throws:**
  - For each throw, the program correctly computes the new positions based on the direction `c`. If `c` is `'?'`, both possible positions are considered.
  - The use of a set ensures that only unique positions are considered.
- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the modulo operation results in `0` by replacing it with `n`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the logic of the game, including the unknown direction of some throws, and ensures that all possible positions of the ball are considered. It also correctly handles the edge case where the modulo operation results in `0`. Therefore, the program produces the correct output for the given problem.

**Final: True**
