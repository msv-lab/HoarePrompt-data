In the given task, the for loop statement is `for _ in range(m):`. The variables in the loop head are `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and `m`. Therefore, only the state of `m` can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0 because `range(m)` will produce a sequence of numbers from 0 to `m-1`, and the loop will iterate over this sequence.
2. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. However, since we can only adjust the state of `m` (as per the task requirement), we need to ensure `m` is greater than 0.
3. The state of `ans` being a set containing `x` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing `x`**
