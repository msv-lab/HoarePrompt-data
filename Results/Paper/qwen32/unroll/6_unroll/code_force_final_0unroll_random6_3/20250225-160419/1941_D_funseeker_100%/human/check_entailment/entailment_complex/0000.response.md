### Reasoning:

Let's analyze each function and how they contribute to solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - It reads the next line of input from the standard input and returns it as a string.
   - This function works correctly for reading input lines.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a line of input using `func_1` and converts it to an integer.
   - It reads the number of test cases and returns it.
   - This function works correctly for reading the number of test cases.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads a line of input using `func_1`, splits it into substrings, and converts each substring to an integer.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for a test case and returns them as a list of integers.
   - This function works correctly for reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function handles the logic for each test case.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction `c` (clockwise, counterclockwise, or unknown), it updates the set `ans` with the possible positions of the ball after the throw.
   - It uses modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the players.
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it replaces it with `n` because player numbering starts from `1` to `n`.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and their sorted identifiers.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the function `func_4` with the first test case from the example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  6 3 2
  2 ?
  2 ?
  2 ?
  ```
- **Process**:
  - Start with player `2`.
  - For the first throw, the ball can move to player `4` (clockwise) or player `0` (counterclockwise, which is player `6`).
  - For the second throw, from player `4`, the ball can move to player `6` or player `2`, and from player `6`, the ball can move to player `2` or player `4`.
  - For the third throw, from player `4` or `6`, the ball can move to player `2` or player `6`, and from player `2`, the ball can move to player `4` or player `0` (player `6`).
  - The unique players who could have the ball after the third throw are `2`, `4`, and `6`.

- **Output**:
  ```
  3
  2 4 6
  ```

The output matches the expected result, confirming that the function `func_4` works correctly.

### Conclusion:

All functions together correctly implement the logic to determine the players who could have the ball after `m` throws, considering the possible directions of each throw.

**Correctness: True**
