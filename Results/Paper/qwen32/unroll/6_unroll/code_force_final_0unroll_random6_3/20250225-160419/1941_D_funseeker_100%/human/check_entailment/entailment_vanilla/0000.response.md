### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing an integer `r` and a character `c` representing the distance and direction of the throw, respectively.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set keeps track of all possible players who could have the ball after each throw.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is `'0'` (clockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it adds the player `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is `'1'` (counterclockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it adds the player `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - After processing each throw, `ans` is updated to `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `0` is in the set `ans` (which can happen if `(q - r) % n` results in `0`), it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is because player numbers are 1-based, not 0-based.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of players in `ans` and the sorted list of these players.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the logic of updating the set of possible players based on the direction of each throw. It also correctly adjusts for 1-based indexing and handles the case where the direction of some throws is unknown. The output format matches the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
