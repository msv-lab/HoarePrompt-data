Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the same as in the initial state, and `ans` is a set of values derived from repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` based on the values of `c` over `m` iterations. If `0` was in `ans`, it is now excluded, and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
