### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the given Python program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version. We'll focus on the correctness of the program's logic and handling of edge cases.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line of input, `func_2` reads an integer, and `func_3` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This is consistent with the problem requirements.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If the direction `c` is `'0'` (clockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the `temp` set.
   - If the direction `c` is `'1'` (counterclockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the `temp` set.
   - The `temp` set is then assigned back to `ans` for the next iteration.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` because the modulo operation can result in `0`, which corresponds to player `n` in a 1-based index system. This is a crucial step to ensure the correct mapping of positions.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of possible positions and the sorted list of these positions, as required by the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis with Annotations:
- **Initialization:** The set `ans` is initialized correctly with the starting player `x`.
- **Loop through Throws:** For each throw, the program correctly updates the set `ans` based on the direction and distance. The use of modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around correctly within the circle.
- **Handling `0` in `ans`:** The program correctly handles the case where `0` appears in the set `ans` by replacing it with `n`. This is necessary because the problem uses a 1-based index system, and `0` would otherwise be an invalid player number.
- **Final Output:** The program prints the number of possible players and their sorted numbers, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all possible directions for each throw and correctly manages the modulo operation to ensure valid player numbers. The edge case where the modulo operation results in `0` is also handled correctly.

**Final:** **True**
