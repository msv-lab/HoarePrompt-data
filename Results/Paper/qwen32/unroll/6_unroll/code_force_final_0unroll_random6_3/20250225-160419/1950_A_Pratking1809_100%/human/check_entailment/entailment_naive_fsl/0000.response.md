Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then checks:
  - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
  - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
  - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all the potential cases as per the problem statement:
- It correctly identifies a "STAIR" when the digits are in strictly increasing order.
- It correctly identifies a "PEAK" when the middle digit is greater than the other two.
- It correctly identifies "NONE" for all other combinations.

The provided examples in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
