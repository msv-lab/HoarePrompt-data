You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of integers input during the loop's final iteration. The value of `t` and `q` will remain unchanged. The loop will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each set of inputs based on the conditions provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `q` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then checks:
  - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
  - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
  - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all the potential cases as per the problem statement:
- It correctly identifies a "STAIR" when the digits are in strictly increasing order.
- It correctly identifies a "PEAK" when the middle digit is greater than the other two.
- It correctly identifies "NONE" for all other combinations.

The provided examples in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
