### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
- Alice appends elements to `c` and deletes them from `a`.
- Bob deletes elements from `a` without appending them to `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

#### Optimal Strategy:
- If a number `i` appears an even number of times in `a`, Alice can ensure she gets the last occurrence of `i`.
- If a number `i` appears an odd number of times in `a`, Bob can ensure he gets the last occurrence of `i`.

The MEX will be the smallest number `i` such that:
- `i` appears an even number of times in `a` (Alice can append it to `c`).
- `i` appears an odd number of times in `a` (Bob will ensure it is not in `c`).

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest number that meets the criteria for being the MEX.

#### Code Logic:
1. **Counter Creation**: `mpp = Counter(arr)` counts the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
2. **Finding MEX**:
   - The code iterates through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If a number `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks (this means `i` does not appear in `arr` at all, so it is the MEX).
   - If `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks (this means `i` appears an odd number of times, and since `first` is `True`, it means this is the first odd occurrence, making `i` the MEX).
   - If `i` appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not correctly handle the case where `i` appears an even number of times. It should only consider the first odd occurrence.
- The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The MEX should be the smallest `i` such that:
  - If `i` appears an even number of times, Alice can append it.
  - If `i` appears an odd number of times, it should be skipped unless it is the smallest number that meets the criteria.

#### Correct Approach:
- Iterate through numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each number `i`, check if it appears an even number of times. If so, it can be part of `c`.
- The first number `i` that appears an odd number of times and is not included in `c` will be the MEX.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly determine the MEX, we need to iterate through numbers from 0 to `n-1` and find the smallest number that appears an even number of times or is not present at all.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp or mpp[i] % 2 == 0:
                print(i)
                break

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the provided code.
