Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine whether the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then he wants to form a different rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be obtained by rotating the other (e.g., `4x3` and `3x4` are the same).

### Key Observations:
1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the side of length `a`, he gets two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)`. 
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the side of length `b`, he gets two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b`.
   
2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - To form a new rectangle, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles must be such that they can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x (b/2)` rectangles. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `a x (b/2) * 2 = a x b`, which is the same as the original rectangle. However, if `b` is even, he can also rearrange them to form a rectangle of size `(a/2) x b` if `a` is even, or `a x (b/2)` if `a` is odd, which is different from the original rectangle.
   - If `b` is odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of integer dimensions that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. The only way to cut it would be into rectangles of size `a x (b-1)/2` and `a x 1`, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The problem essentially boils down to checking if `b` is even. If `b` is even, Bob can always form a different rectangle by rearranging the smaller rectangles. If `b` is odd, he cannot.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' if it is not. This aligns with our analysis.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' if it is not. This matches the logic required to solve the problem.
Correctness: **True**
