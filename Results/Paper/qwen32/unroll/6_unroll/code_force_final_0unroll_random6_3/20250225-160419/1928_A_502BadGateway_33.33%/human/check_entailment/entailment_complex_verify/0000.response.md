Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. The program only checks if the width `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The problem requires checking if either the height `a` or the width `b` is even, as either condition allows Bob to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can potentially be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1` only considers the evenness of `b` and does not take into account the evenness of `a`. This oversight leads to incorrect results for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd, such as the counterexample provided in the original assessment.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should be modified to check if either `a` or `b` is even, as suggested in the original assessment:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No'
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Final: **False**
