### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even and does not consider whether `a` is even. This is insufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle, as the rectangle can be cut along either dimension.

Let's break it down further:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - Bob can cut the `a x b` rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to either the `a` side or the `b` side.
   - He can then form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles.
   - For Bob to form another rectangle, at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) must be even. This allows him to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` returns 'yes' if `b` is even and 'no' otherwise. This logic is incomplete because it does not consider the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function only checks if `b` is even and fails to consider the case where `a` is even. It provides a counterexample (`2 3`) where the program outputs 'no' but should output 'yes'.

4. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The corrected logic should check if either `a` or `b` is even. This ensures that Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` needs to check both `a` and `b` for evenness to correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
