Postcondition: **For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's in the respective string of length 5. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`. The state of `t` and the input strings remains unchanged.**
