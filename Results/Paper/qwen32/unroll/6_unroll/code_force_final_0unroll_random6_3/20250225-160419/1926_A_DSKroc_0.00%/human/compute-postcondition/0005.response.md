Postcondition: **For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `ac` and `bc` will hold the count of 'A's and 'B's in the respective string of length 5, but these values will not be stored or accessible after the loop for each test case completes. The state of `t` and the input strings remains unchanged. Additionally, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
