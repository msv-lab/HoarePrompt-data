### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given solution to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Game Setup**: 
   - There are `2n` cards, with each integer from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice.
   - Both players receive `n` cards each.
   - Players take turns placing cards on the table, and a player scores a point if the card's number is already on the table.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally, knowing that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - You want to maximize your points.
   - Nene wants to maximize her points and minimize your points.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input and for each test case, it calculates the difference between the total number of cards in your hand and the number of unique cards in your hand.

- **Logic**:
  - `tokens := line.split()` splits the line of card numbers into a list.
  - `len(tokens)` gives the total number of cards you have.
  - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique card numbers in your hand.
  - The difference `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` counts the number of duplicate cards in your hand.

- **Interpretation**:
  - If you have `k` duplicates in your hand, you can potentially score `k` points because each duplicate can be placed on the table after its first occurrence (which will be placed by Nene or yourself in a previous turn).
  - This logic assumes that you can always place your duplicates in such a way that you score points, which is not necessarily true given Nene's optimal play.

#### Flaw in the Program:
The program does not account for Nene's optimal strategy. Nene can strategically place her cards to minimize your score. For example, if you have duplicates, Nene might place one of the same card before you can place the other, preventing you from scoring.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for Nene's optimal play strategy and thus does not always provide the correct maximum number of points you can score.

### Correctness: **False**
