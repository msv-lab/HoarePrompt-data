Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible input cases. Specifically, the program assumes that if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, then only two invitations are needed. However, this is not always the case.

For example, consider the test case:

```
4
1 2 3 4
```

In this case, no two friends are each other's best friends. However, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party because friend 1's best friend is friend 2 and vice versa. Therefore, the correct answer is 2, not 3.

The program should consider all possible pairs of friends and determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least two friends come to the party. The current implementation does not handle all scenarios correctly.
