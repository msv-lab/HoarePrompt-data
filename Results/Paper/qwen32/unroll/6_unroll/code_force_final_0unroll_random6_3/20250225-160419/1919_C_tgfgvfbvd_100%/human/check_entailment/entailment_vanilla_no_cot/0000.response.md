Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. The program attempts to split the array into two subsequences in a way that minimizes the penalty, but the logic used is flawed.

The core issue is that the program does not correctly account for the optimal way to split the array into subsequences `s` and `t` to minimize the penalty. The program seems to try to maintain two variables `a` and `b` to track the smallest elements in the subsequences, but it does not correctly handle the transitions between the subsequences or ensure that the penalty is minimized.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to determine the optimal split, but the current implementation does not achieve this. Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem.
