In the given task, the loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range is determined by the integer `n` obtained from the input. The loop body is not provided, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the objects in the loop head.

Here's the loop statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. The loop will execute if the range is greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its initial value before the loop doesn't affect the execution of the loop. The critical factor is the value of `n` which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The initial state of `_` does not matter because it is reassigned by the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable and its initial value does not matter**.

Since the problem specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, the condition `n` must be greater than 0 is already satisfied by the problem constraints. However, for the sake of explicitly stating the condition for the loop to execute, we can reiterate that `n` should be at least 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable and its initial value does not matter**.
