Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if there exists a template string `t` of length `n` such that:
- Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching rules are:
- If the `i`-th character of `t` is lowercase, then the `i`-th character of `a` and `b` must be the same as the `i`-th character of `t`.
- If the `i`-th character of `t` is uppercase, then the `i`-th character of `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the `i`-th character of `t`.
- String `c` must not match the template `t` under the same rules.

### Program Analysis

Let's consider the provided program:

```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

#### Function `func_1`

This function checks if there is at least one position `i` where the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a suitable template exists. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

#### Function `func_2`

This function handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then uses `func_1` to determine if a suitable template exists. It collects the results and prints them.

### Correctness Analysis

The logic of `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if there is a position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that a suitable template exists that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

For a template `t` to exist:
1. For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be `a[i]` (lowercase).
2. If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
3. String `c` must not match the template `t`.

The current implementation does not consider all these conditions. It only checks if there is a position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given requirements.

Correctness: **False**
