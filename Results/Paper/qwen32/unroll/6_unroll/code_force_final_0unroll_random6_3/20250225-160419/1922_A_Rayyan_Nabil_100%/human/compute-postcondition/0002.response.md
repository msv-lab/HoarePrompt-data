The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition. 

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
