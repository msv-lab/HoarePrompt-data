The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20`). It then computes and prints the number of positions at which the corresponding characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same.
