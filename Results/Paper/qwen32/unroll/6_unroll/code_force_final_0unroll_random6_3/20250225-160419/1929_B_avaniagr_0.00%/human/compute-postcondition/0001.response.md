Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each representing the result of the computation for the corresponding test case. Each line contains an integer value determined by the given formula based on the values of n and k from the input. Specifically, for each test case, the output is calculated as follows:
- If k is less than 4n - 3, the output is (k // 2 + k % 2).
- If k is equal to 4n - 2, the output is 1 added to the previous result.
- If k is equal to or greater than 4n - 3, the output is 2 * n.**
