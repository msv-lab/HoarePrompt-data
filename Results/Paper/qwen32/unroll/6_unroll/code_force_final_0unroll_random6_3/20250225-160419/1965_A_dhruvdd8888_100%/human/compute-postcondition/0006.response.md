To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop step by step with the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `N` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are provided as part of the input.
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the unique strings in the initial `nums` set.
- `ls` is initialized to 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list. For each element `nums[i]`:
1. Subtract the current value of `ls` from `nums[i]`.
2. Add the new value of `nums[i]` (after subtraction) to `ls`.

Let's consider an example to understand this better:
- Suppose `nums` is initially `[1, 2, 3]` and `ls` is `0`.
- Iteration 1: `nums[0]` = `1 - 0` = `1`, then `ls` = `0 + 1` = `1`.
- Iteration 2: `nums[1]` = `2 - 1` = `1`, then `ls` = `1 + 1` = `2`.
- Iteration 3: `nums[2]` = `3 - 2` = `1`, then `ls` = `2 + 1` = `3`.

After the loop, `nums` will be `[1, 1, 1]` and `ls` will be `3`.

### Generalization:
For a sorted list `nums` of length `m`, after the loop:
- Each element in `nums` will be `1` because each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the cumulative sum of the previous elements (which is `ls` before the current iteration starts).
- The final value of `ls` will be the sum of the original `nums` list because each element contributes to `ls` after being reduced.

### Output State:
Given the above, the output state can be described as:
- `nums` will be a list of `1`s with the same length as the initial `nums`.
- `ls` will be the sum of the original `nums` list.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`nums` is a list of 1s with the same length as the initial `nums`, and `ls` is the sum of the original `nums` list.**
