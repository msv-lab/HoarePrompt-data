The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each provided as input, and prints a value for each string. This value is determined based on the number of '1's that can be paired with '0's in the string, considering the order of characters. Specifically, for each '0' in the string, it counts how many '1's have appeared before it, and for each '1', it counts how many '0's will appear after it. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the result for each binary string.
