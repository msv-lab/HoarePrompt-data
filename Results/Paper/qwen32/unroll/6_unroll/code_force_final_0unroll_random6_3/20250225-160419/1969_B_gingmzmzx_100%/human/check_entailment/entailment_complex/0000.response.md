### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to calculate the minimum total cost to make each binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The program operates as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeros**: It counts the total number of zeros in the string `s` and initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it checks if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). If yes, it increments the cost `ans` by 1 because this 0 can be paired with a 1 to potentially reduce the number of inversions.
     - If `c` is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost `ans`. This accounts for the cost of shifting this 1 past all remaining 0s to sort the string.

4. **Output**: For each test case, it prints the calculated cost `ans`.

### Analysis:

The program's logic is based on counting inversions in the binary string. An inversion in a binary string is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] > s[j]`. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted, which is equivalent to the number of inversions that can be resolved by that operation.

The program correctly calculates the cost by considering two scenarios:
- When a 0 is encountered, it checks if there have been any 1s before it, indicating an inversion.
- When a 1 is encountered, it counts how many 0s will come after it, indicating potential inversions.

By summing these costs, the program effectively calculates the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and implements the intended logic to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
