Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach than what is directly implied by the problem statement. Let's break down the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculating the Number of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It checks if \(x\) is greater than 0, and if so, adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it increments `suma` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic Error:**
   - The program's logic does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the conditions checked do not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not explained or justified by the problem statement.
   - There is no clear explanation of how the program ensures that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
- For each pair, checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program's logic and the lack of alignment with the problem statement, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
