### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Statement Analysis:**
   - The problem requires finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
   - It initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It checks if \(x\) is greater than 0 and adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to potentially increment `suma` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The formula for \(x\) and the conditions checked do not directly address the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The subtraction of 2 from `suma` before printing is not justified by the problem statement.
   - The program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition would provide the correct result.

### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not provide any evidence that the logic correctly implements the problem's requirements.
- The annotations confirm that the program iterates over values of \(b\) and calculates \(x\) but do not justify the correctness of the approach.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program does not align with the problem's requirements, and the subtraction of 2 from `suma` is unjustified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
