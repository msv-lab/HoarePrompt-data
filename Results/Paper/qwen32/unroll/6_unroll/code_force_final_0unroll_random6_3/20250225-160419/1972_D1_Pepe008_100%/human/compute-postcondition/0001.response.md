To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `t` and `T`. The loop will iterate over the range of `T`, so `T` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `t` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, `T` is an integer read from the standard input and can be between 1 and 10^4. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `T` is at least 1. The variable `t` does not need to be initialized manually because it will be set by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` will be initialized by the loop**
