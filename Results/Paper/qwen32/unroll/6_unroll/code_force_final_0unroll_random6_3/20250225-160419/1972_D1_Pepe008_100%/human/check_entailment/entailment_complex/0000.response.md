### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of `b` and calculating the number of valid `a` values for each `b`. However, the logic inside the loop seems incorrect and does not properly reflect the problem's requirements.

The problem requires that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The program's approach does not correctly implement this condition. Instead, it seems to be trying to calculate a sum based on some formula involving `a` and `b`, but it does not account for the gcd condition in a way that ensures the correctness of the result.

Let's break down the problem correctly:

1. For each test case, we need to find pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
2. The gcd function can be used to simplify the condition. Specifically, `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` if and only if `(a / gcd(a, b)) + 1` is a multiple of `b / gcd(a, b)`.
3. This can be further simplified by iterating over possible values of `b` and checking for valid `a` values.

The provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
