The function receives no direct input arguments but reads from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which denotes the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
