You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

                suma += x

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives no direct input arguments but reads from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which denotes the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.

    T = int(input())

        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1

                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: `T` is unchanged, `t` is equal to `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` hold the values of the last test case, `suma` holds the final sum for the last test case, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` holds the last calculated value of `x` for the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates over each possible value of b from 1 to m and calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the given conditions.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Correctness of the Logic**: The program should correctly compute the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
2. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases, such as when n or m is 1, and when gcd(a, b) is a special value (like 1 or b).

### Provided Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

### Issues Found:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs (a, b). The formula used in the program to calculate `x` and the conditions to increment `suma` do not align with the problem's requirements.
2. **Incorrect Output Handling**: The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not justified by the problem description.
3. **Variable Misuse**: The variables `a` and `b` in the program are incorrectly named and used. The variable `a` in the loop should represent `b` in the problem description, and vice versa.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not meet the problem's requirements and will not produce correct results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. The variable misuse and the incorrect formula used result in incorrect outputs for many test cases.
