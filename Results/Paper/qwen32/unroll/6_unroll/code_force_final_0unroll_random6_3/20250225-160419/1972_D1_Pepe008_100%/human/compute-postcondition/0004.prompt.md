You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives no direct input arguments but reads from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which denotes the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: `T` is unchanged, `t` is equal to `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` hold the values of the last test case, `suma` holds the final sum for the last test case, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` holds the last calculated value of `x` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, the function processes the values of `n` and `m` and returns a result based on these values.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
