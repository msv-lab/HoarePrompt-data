You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and prints the result minus 2.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach than what is directly implied by the problem statement. Let's break down the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculating the Number of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It checks if \(x\) is greater than 0, and if so, adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it increments `suma` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic Error:**
   - The program's logic does not directly address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the conditions checked do not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not explained or justified by the problem statement.
   - There is no clear explanation of how the program ensures that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.
- For each pair, checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program's logic and the lack of alignment with the problem statement, the program is incorrect.
