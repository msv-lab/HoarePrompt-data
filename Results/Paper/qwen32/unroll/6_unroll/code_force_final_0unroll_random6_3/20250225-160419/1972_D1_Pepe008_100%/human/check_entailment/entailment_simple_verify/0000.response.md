### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each possible value of `b` from 1 to `m` and calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the given conditions.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Correctness of the Logic**: The program should correctly compute the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
2. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases, such as when `n` or `m` is 1, and when gcd(a, b) is a special value (like 1 or b).

#### Program Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, which helps in understanding the flow and state of variables.

#### Issues Found:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The formula used in the program to calculate `x` and the conditions to increment `suma` do not align with the problem's requirements. The logic seems to be derived from a different problem or has errors.
2. **Incorrect Output Handling**: The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not justified by the problem description.
3. **Variable Misuse**: The variables `a` and `b` in the program are incorrectly named and used. The variable `a` in the loop should represent `b` in the problem description, and vice versa.

#### Verification Using Annotated Version:
The annotated version does not provide any additional insights that would justify the correctness of the program. Instead, it confirms the issues mentioned above:
- The calculation of `x` and the conditions to update `suma` are not aligned with the problem's requirements.
- The subtraction of 2 from `suma` is unjustified.
- The variable `a` and `b` are misused.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not meet the problem's requirements and will not produce correct results for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
