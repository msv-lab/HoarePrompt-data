### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Function Summary:

The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and prints the result minus 2.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The provided program does not correctly compute the number of pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula used in the program to calculate `x` and the conditions to increment `suma` do not align with the problem's requirements.
   
2. **Incorrect Output Handling**: The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not justified by the problem description.
   
3. **Variable Misuse**: The variables `a` and `b` in the program are incorrectly named and used. The variable `a` in the loop should represent `b` in the problem description, and vice versa.

#### Detailed Analysis:

The program iterates over each possible value of `b` from 1 to `m` and calculates `x` as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). It then adds `x` to `suma` if `x` is positive. Additionally, it checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to increment `suma` by 1. Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

The logic in the program does not correctly reflect the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula used and the conditions checked do not correspond to this requirement.

#### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program does not meet the problem's requirements and will not produce correct results for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
