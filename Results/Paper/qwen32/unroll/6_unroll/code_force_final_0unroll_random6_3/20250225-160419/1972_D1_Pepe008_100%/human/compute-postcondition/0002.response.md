To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given code. The code processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a sum (`suma`) based on certain conditions and then prints `suma - 2`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Outer Loop (`for t in range(T)`):** This loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it reads a line of input, splits it into two integers `a` and `b`, and then processes them.

2. **Inner Loop (`for i in range(1, b + 1)`):** This loop runs from `1` to `b` (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates:
   - `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`
   - If `x` is greater than `0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Additionally, if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, it increments `suma` by `1`.

3. **Output:** After the inner loop completes for a test case, the code prints `suma - 2`.

The output state after all iterations will be the final printed values for each test case, which are stored in the standard output.

Given the nature of the problem, the output state cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` for each test case. However, we can describe the final state of the variables involved in the loop after all iterations.

- `T` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `t` will be equal to `T` after the outer loop completes.
- `info`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values of the last test case processed.
- `suma` will hold the final sum calculated for the last test case.
- `i` will be `b + 1` after the inner loop for the last test case completes.
- `x` will hold the last calculated value of `x` for the last test case.

Since the specific values of `a` and `b` for each test case are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `suma` and `x`. However, we can describe the state of the variables after all iterations.

Output State: **`T` is unchanged, `t` is equal to `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` hold the values of the last test case, `suma` holds the final sum for the last test case, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` holds the last calculated value of `x` for the last test case.**
