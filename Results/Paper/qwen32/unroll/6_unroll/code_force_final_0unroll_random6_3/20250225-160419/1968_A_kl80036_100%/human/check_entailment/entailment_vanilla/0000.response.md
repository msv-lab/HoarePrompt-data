Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

### Key Insight

To maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of two numbers is maximized when the two numbers share the most common factors. 

For the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) to be maximized, \( y \) should be as large as possible while still being less than \( x \). The largest possible \( y \) is \( x - 1 \).

### Verification

Let's verify if choosing \( y = x - 1 \) indeed maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \):

- When \( y = x - 1 \):
  - If \( x \) is even, \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \) because \( x-1 \) is odd and has no common factors with \( x \) other than 1.
  - If \( x \) is odd, \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \) because \( x-1 \) is even and has no common factors with \( x \) other than 1.
- Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

This is the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because any other \( y \) less than \( x-1 \) will have a smaller GCD with \( x \), and hence a smaller sum.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and then outputs \( y = x - 1 \).

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)
```

The logic in the program aligns with our analysis. For each test case, it computes \( y = x - 1 \) and prints it, which is a valid solution according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
