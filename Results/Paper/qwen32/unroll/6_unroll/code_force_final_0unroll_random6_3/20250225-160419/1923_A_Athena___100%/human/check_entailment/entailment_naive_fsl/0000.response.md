Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. The current implementation simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the optimal way to move the chips.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example Input:**
```
1
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We have chips at positions 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- We need to move the chips at positions 7 and 8 to form a single block.
- The optimal way is to move the chip from position 7 to position 4 and the chip from position 8 to position 5.
- This results in a total of 3 moves.

**Current Program Output:**
The program will count the free cells between the first and last chip (positions 2 and 8), which are 5 free cells. However, the correct answer should be 3, as explained above.

**Why the Program is Incorrect:**
The program does not consider the optimal way to move the chips. It simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.

To fix the program, we need to consider the positions of all chips and calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring them together optimally. This involves calculating the cost of moving each chip to all possible positions and choosing the position with the minimum total cost.
