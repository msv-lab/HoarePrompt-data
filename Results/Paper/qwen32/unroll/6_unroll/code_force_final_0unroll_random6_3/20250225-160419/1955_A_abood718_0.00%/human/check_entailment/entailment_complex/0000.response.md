Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly computes the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the conditions.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.
- **Conditions**:
  - If buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotional price (`b`), then buy as many yogurts as possible at the regular price.
  - If `n` is even, buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price (`b`) is always cheaper or equal to buying them at the regular price, so use the promotional price for all pairs.
  - If `n` is odd, buy `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price and the remaining one yogurt at the regular price.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. The logic is as follows:
1. **Condition 1**: If `b * 2 < a` (which seems to be a typo and should be `b < 2 * a`), it prints `n * a`. This condition is incorrect because it does not consider the promotion when it should.
2. **Condition 2**: If `n` is even, it calculates the cost as `n * b / 2`. This is incorrect because it should be `(n // 2) * b` instead to ensure integer division.
3. **Condition 3**: If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(n // 2) * b + a`. This is correct.

### Corrected Conditions:
1. If `b < 2 * a`, buy pairs at the promotional price and the last one at the regular price if `n` is odd.
2. If `n` is even, buy pairs at the promotional price.
3. If `n` is odd, buy `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price and the last one at the regular price.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        
        # Calculate the total cost
        if b < 2 * a:
            total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        else:
            total_cost = n * a
        
        print(total_cost)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly handle the conditions and calculations as described above. Specifically, the first condition is incorrectly implemented, and the even and odd conditions need to be adjusted.

**Correctness: False**

The program provided in the problem does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all test cases.
