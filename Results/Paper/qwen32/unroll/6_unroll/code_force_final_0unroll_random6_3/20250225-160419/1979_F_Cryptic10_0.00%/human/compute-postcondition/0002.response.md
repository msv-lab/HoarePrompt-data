To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `remaining_vertices` is not empty when the loop starts. The `remaining_vertices` set contains integers from 1 to `n`, which means it should not be empty as long as `n` is a positive integer.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `remaining_vertices` is initialized to contain integers from 1 to `n`, the set `remaining_vertices` will definitely not be empty. Therefore, no modification is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, such that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n**
