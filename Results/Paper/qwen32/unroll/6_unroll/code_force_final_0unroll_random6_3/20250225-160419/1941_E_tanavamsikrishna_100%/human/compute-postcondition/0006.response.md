To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(total_costs))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the given information:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total_costs` is a list that contains sums of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - The number of elements in `total_costs` will be `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which is equivalent to `n - (k - 1)` because `len(costs) == n`.

2. **Understanding `total_costs`:**
   - Each element in `total_costs` is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, then `total_costs` would be `[1+2+3, 2+3+4, 3+4+5]`, which is `[6, 9, 12]`.

3. **Finding the Minimum:**
   - The `min(total_costs)` function will find the smallest sum among all the sums in the `total_costs` list.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the smallest sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
