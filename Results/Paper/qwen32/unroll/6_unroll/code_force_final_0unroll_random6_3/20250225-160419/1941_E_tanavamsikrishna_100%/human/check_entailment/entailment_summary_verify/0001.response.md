### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze both `func_1` and `func_2` based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`

**Purpose:** Calculate the minimum cost to install supports in a single row.

**Implementation Analysis:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost of the first support at the first column to 1 (since `a_{i,1} = 0`).
   - For `i in range(1, d)`, `row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This sets the cost of the next `d-1` supports to `a_{i,j} + 2`. This part seems correct for initializing the first `d` supports.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This creates a list of tuples `(cost, index)` for the first `d` elements and then converts it into a min-heap.
   - `heapify(min_heap)`: This transforms the list into a heap, allowing efficient retrieval of the minimum element.

3. **Processing Remaining Columns:**
   - For `i in range(d, len(row))`:
     - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`: This loop pops elements from the heap until it finds an element within the last `d+2` columns. The intention seems to be to ensure that the minimum cost support is within the allowed distance `d`.
     - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This sets the cost of the current column to the minimum cost found in the heap plus the current cell's cost plus 1.
     - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This re-pushes the popped element back into the heap.
     - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This pushes the new cost for the current column into the heap.

**Correctness Consideration:**

- The logic for maintaining the heap and ensuring that the minimum cost path is correctly calculated seems flawed. Specifically, the `while` loop that pops elements from the heap until it finds an element within the last `d+2` columns does not correctly handle the re-pushing of the popped elements. This could lead to incorrect results.
- The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is intended to ensure that the minimum cost support is within the allowed distance `d`, but the re-pushing of popped elements is not correctly managed, which can lead to incorrect heap states.

#### Function `func_2()`

**Purpose:** Read input, process each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

**Implementation Analysis:**

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `(n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: This reads the grid dimensions and other parameters.
   - `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: This reads the grid itself.

2. **Calculating Costs:**
   - `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: This calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.

3. **Finding Minimum Total Cost:**
   - `total_costs = []`: This initializes a list to store the total costs for `k` consecutive rows.
   - For `i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`, `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: This calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - `print(min(total_costs))`: This prints the minimum total cost.

**Correctness Consideration:**

- The logic for summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finding the minimum total cost seems correct. However, the correctness of the results heavily depends on the correctness of `func_1`.
- Since `func_1` has issues with the heap management, the calculated costs for each row may be incorrect, leading to incorrect total costs.

### Conclusion

The primary issue with the given program lies in the implementation of `func_1`. The logic for handling the heap and ensuring that the minimum cost path is correctly calculated seems flawed. Specifically, the `while` loop that handles the heap could be incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct based on the provided implementation.

**Final: False**
