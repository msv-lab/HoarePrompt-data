### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it correctly addresses the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns. The depth in each cell `(i, j)` is given by `a_{i,j}`. The first and last columns are river banks and have depth 0.
2. **Bridge Construction**:
   - A bridge is built on a row by installing supports at certain cells.
   - Supports must be installed in the first and last cells of the row.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
3. **Multiple Bridges**:
   - Rudolf wants to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the cost of installing supports on a single row.
   - It sets the cost of the first cell to 1 (`row[0] = 1`).
   - It increments the next `d-1` cells by 2 (`row[i] = row[i] + 2`).
   - It uses a min-heap to maintain the minimum cost of installing supports while ensuring that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function returns the cost of installing supports on the entire row.
   
   **Issue**: The implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the cost of installing supports with the given constraints. Specifically, the way it handles the heap and increments the costs may not be accurate for the problem's requirements. The function does not correctly implement the logic for ensuring the minimum cost while maintaining the distance constraint `d`. It seems to be attempting a dynamic programming approach but does not do so correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the depths of the river cells into a list of rows.
   - It calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
   - The function prints the minimum total cost.

   **Issue**: Since `func_1` is not correctly implemented, the total costs calculated by `func_2` will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`. The logic for calculating the cost of installing supports with the given constraints is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
