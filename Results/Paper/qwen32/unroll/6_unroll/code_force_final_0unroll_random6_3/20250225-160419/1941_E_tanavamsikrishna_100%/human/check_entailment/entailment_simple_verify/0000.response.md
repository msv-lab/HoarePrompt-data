Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Recap

The task is to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid with the minimum cost. Each support in cell `(i, j)` has a cost of `a_{i,j} + 1`. The supports must be installed in cells `(i,1)` and `(i,m)`, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`

This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row with a maximum distance `d` between supports.

**Annotations:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - `row[0] = 1`: Sets the cost of the first support.
   - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: Initializes the costs for the first `d` columns.
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: Creates a heap of the first `d` elements.
   - `heapify(min_heap)`: Converts the list into a heap.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass`: Pops elements from the heap without using them.
   - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: Updates the cost at column `i`.
   - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: Pushes the popped element back into the heap.
   - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: Pushes the new cost at column `i` into the heap.

**Issues:**
- **Heap Management:** The loop `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` is problematic. It pops elements from the heap without using them, which means the heap is being emptied unnecessarily and the correct minimum cost is not being used.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. It should be `row[i] = e[0] + 1` because `row[i]` already contains the depth at column `i`.

#### Function `func_2()`

This function reads input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

**Annotations:**
- `n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: Reads the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance.
- `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: Reads the grid.
- `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: Calculates the cost for each row.
- `total_costs = []`: Initializes a list to store the total costs.
- `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)): total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: Sums the costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
- `print(min(total_costs))`: Prints the minimum total cost.

**Issues:**
- The issues in `func_1` propagate to `func_2`, leading to incorrect total costs.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the test case:
```
1
3 5 1 1
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

Expected output: `2` (build the bridge on the first row with supports at columns 1 and 5).

Actual output: Incorrect due to the issues in `func_1`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct. The code contains significant issues in `func_1` that lead to incorrect cost calculations. The heap management and cost calculations need to be corrected to ensure the program meets the problem requirements.

**Final Answer:**

Correctness: **False**.

Final: **False**
