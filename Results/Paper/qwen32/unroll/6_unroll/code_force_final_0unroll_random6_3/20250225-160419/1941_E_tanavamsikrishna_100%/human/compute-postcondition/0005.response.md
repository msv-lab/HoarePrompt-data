To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the code and understand what it does:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `n`: Number of rows.
   - `m`: Number of columns (with the constraint `m >= 3`).
   - `k`: Number of bridges (with the constraint `1 <= k <= n`).
   - `d`: Maximum distance between supports (with the constraint `1 <= d <= m`).
   - `rows`: A 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns.
   - `costs`: A list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.
   - `total_costs`: An initially empty list.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list starting from the current index `i`.
   - This sum is then appended to the `total_costs` list.

3. **Determine the Output State:**
   - The `total_costs` list will contain sums of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - The number of elements in `total_costs` will be `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which is equivalent to `n - (k - 1)` because `len(costs) == n`.

The final output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an input integer representing the number of columns such that `m` >= 3, `k` is an input integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `d` is an input integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= `d` <= `m`, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs` with a length of `n - (k - 1)`.**
