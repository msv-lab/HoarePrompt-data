Functionality: **The function `func_1` modifies a given list `row` of integers by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing the next `d-1` elements by 2. It then updates the remaining elements of `row` based on a min-heap data structure, which considers the maximum distance `d` between supports. Finally, the function returns the last element of the modified `row`.**
