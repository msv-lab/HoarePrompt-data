### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the original assessment using the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to determine a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Specifically, for each outcome \( i \), the condition \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \) must hold.

#### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \). It then assigns bets based on the LCM divided by each multiplier. The bets are calculated as \( x_i = \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).

The condition checked is \( \text{sumo} \geq \text{prod} \), where `sumo` is the sum of the bets and `prod` is the LCM. If this condition is true, it outputs `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it outputs the calculated bets.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect based on a counterexample where the input is `1 3 2 2 2`. The counterexample suggests the program incorrectly outputs `-1` because the sum of the bets (3) is not less than the LCM (2).

#### Re-evaluation:
Let's re-examine the logic with the counterexample:
- For the input `2 2 2`, the LCM is indeed `2`.
- The bets calculated are `[1, 1, 1]` because \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) for each multiplier.
- The sum of the bets is `3`.

However, the condition `sumo >= prod` translates to `3 >= 2`, which is true. Therefore, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it is impossible to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome when the LCM is `2` and the sum of the bets is `3`.

The original assessment seems to misunderstand the condition being checked. The program is actually correct in this case because the condition `sumo >= prod` correctly identifies that no valid distribution exists.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of bets exists and outputs `-1` when no such distribution is possible.

### Final: **True**
