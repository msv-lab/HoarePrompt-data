Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. Here's an explanation of why:

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then attempts to distribute the bets based on the ratio of the LCM to each multiplier. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

The core issue is that the program does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The condition `if sumo >= prod` only checks if the sum of the bets is not greater than or equal to the LCM, but it does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each multiplier.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. One way to do this is to subtract a small value from the LCM before distributing the bets, ensuring that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = lcm(a)
        
        # Subtract 1 to ensure the sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back
        prod -= 1
        
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += a[i]
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ' '.join(map(str, a))
            print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome, thus satisfying the problem's requirements.
