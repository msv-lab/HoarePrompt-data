Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` indicating the number of integers in the list, followed by a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` where each integer `k_i` is between 2 and 20. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each test case.**
