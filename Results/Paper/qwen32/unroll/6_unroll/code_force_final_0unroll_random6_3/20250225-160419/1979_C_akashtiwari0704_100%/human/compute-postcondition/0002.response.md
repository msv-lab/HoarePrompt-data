To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the transformations that occur within the loop for each test case.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - For each test case, the number of integers `bets` (n) is read.
   - A list `a` of `bets` integers is read.

2. **Computation of LCM**:
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in list `a` is computed using the `lcm` function.

3. **Transformation and Summation**:
   - Each element of the list `a` is transformed to `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of the list.
   - The sum of these transformed elements is computed and stored in `sumo`.

4. **Output Decision**:
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the transformed list `a` is printed as a space-separated string.

5. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The above steps are repeated for each of the `t` test cases.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state of variables between different test cases does not influence each other, the final output state is simply the result of processing all `t` test cases according to the described steps.

Given that the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, and since the output is printed directly within the loop for each test case, there is no single final state of variables that can be described outside the context of individual test cases.

However, if we have to describe the state in terms of what remains after all test cases have been processed, we can say that the variables `t`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` will not retain any specific values as they are re-initialized for each test case. The only persistent effect is the printed output for each test case.

Given the problem's constraints and the nature of the loop, the output state in terms of variables is:

Output State: **Variables `t`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` do not retain specific values after all iterations, and the output is printed directly within the loop for each test case.**
