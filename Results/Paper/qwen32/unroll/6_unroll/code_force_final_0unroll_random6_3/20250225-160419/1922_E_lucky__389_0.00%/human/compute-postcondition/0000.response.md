The code provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. This input represents the number of increasing subsequences required in the array. However, the initial state mentions that there are `t` test cases, each with its own integer `X`. The code snippet provided only reads one integer, which would correspond to one of the `X` values for one of the test cases. The values of `t` and the other `X` values remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required in the array. `x` is assigned the value of the first integer input.**
