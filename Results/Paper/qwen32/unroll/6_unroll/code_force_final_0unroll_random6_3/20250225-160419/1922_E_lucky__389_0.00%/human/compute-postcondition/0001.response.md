The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Given that `x` was initially assigned the value of the first integer input `X`, after the operation `x -= 1`, `x` becomes `X - 1`. The number of test cases `t` and the range condition for `X` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ `X` ≤ 10^18) representing the number of increasing subsequences required in the array. `x` is `X - 1`.**
