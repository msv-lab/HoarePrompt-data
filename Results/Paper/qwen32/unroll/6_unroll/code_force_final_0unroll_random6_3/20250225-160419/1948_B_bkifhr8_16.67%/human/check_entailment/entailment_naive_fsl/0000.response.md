Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks the immediate previous element to see if it is greater than the current element and greater than 10, and then splits it. This approach does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the allowed operations.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 30 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The array can be transformed to [1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5] by splitting 12 and 30, which is sorted.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The program will only check if 12 > 30, which is false, so it will not split 12.
- Then it will check if 30 > 4, which is true, and 30 > 10, which is also true, so it will split 30 into 3 and 0, resulting in [12, 3, 0, 4, 5].
- It will then check if 3 > 0, which is true, and 3 > 10, which is false, so it will not split 3.
- It will then check if 0 > 4, which is false.
- Finally, it will check if 4 > 5, which is false.
- The array [12, 3, 0, 4, 5] is not sorted, so the program will output "NO".

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the case where splitting an element can help sort the array, but the program does not attempt to split further elements to achieve the sorted order. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
