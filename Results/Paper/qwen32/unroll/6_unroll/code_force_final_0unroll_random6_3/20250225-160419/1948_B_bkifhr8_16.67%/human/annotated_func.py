#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of lst is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The function will be called multiple times (up to 10^3 times) with different lists as input, each preceded by an integer n indicating the length of the list.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' is already sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if the input list `lst` of integers (where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive and the length of the list is between 2 and 50 inclusive) is already sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the list is sorted; otherwise, it returns `False`.
