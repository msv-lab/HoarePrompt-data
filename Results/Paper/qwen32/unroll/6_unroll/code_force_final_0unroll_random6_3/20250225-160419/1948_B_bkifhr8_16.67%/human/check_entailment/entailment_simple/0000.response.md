### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program iterates through the array from the second element to the last.
   - If it finds an element that is greater than the previous one and is at least 10, it splits this element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
   - This operation is performed only once per iteration, and the loop continues to the next element.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After processing the array (potentially splitting some elements), the program calls a function `func_1(lst)` to check if the array is sorted.
   - The function `func_1(lst)` sorts the array and compares it to the original array to determine if it's already sorted.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array is sorted, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:

- **Limited Splitting**: The program only performs the splitting operation once per iteration. This means that if an element is split into multiple digits, and one of those digits is still greater than the next element, the program will not catch this and will incorrectly conclude that the array cannot be sorted.
  
- **Incorrect Logic for Splitting**: The program only checks if the current element is greater than the previous one and is at least 10. It does not handle cases where the previous element is already greater than the current one, which might require splitting the previous element instead.

- **Single Pass Limitation**: The program performs a single pass through the array. This is insufficient because the splitting operation might need to be repeated multiple times to achieve a sorted array.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
