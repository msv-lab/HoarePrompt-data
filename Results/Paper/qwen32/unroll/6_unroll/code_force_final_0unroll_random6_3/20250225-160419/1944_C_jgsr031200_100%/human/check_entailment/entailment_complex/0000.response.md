### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - A frequency array `freq` is created to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The length of `freq` is `n + 1` because the integers in `arr` range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Finding MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the `freq` array to find the smallest integer that either appears exactly once in `arr` or does not appear at all.
   - It uses a counter `cou` to keep track of how many unique elements (i.e., elements that appear exactly once) have been found.
   - The loop breaks when either:
     - `cou` reaches `2` (indicating that two unique elements have been found).
     - The frequency of an integer `i` is `0` (indicating that `i` is not present in `arr`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the smallest integer `i` that meets the above conditions.

### Analysis:

- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - The strategy for Alice would be to pick elements that are not yet in `c` or are unique, thereby increasing the MEX.
  - Bob's strategy would be to pick elements that are already in `c` or are not unique, thereby minimizing the MEX.

- **Correctness of the Program**:
  - The program correctly calculates the MEX by considering the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
  - Since the game's outcome depends on the final composition of `c`, and the final composition is influenced by the order of picks, the program's logic of finding the smallest integer that either appears exactly once or not at all aligns with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX based on optimal play.
  - The provided logic ensures that the smallest possible MEX is determined correctly, considering the constraints and the nature of the game.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

Correctness: **True**
