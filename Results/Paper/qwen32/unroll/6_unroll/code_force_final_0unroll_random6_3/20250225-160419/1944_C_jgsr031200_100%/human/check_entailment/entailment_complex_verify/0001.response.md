### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Optimal Play:
- Alice and Bob will play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
- However, the MEX is ultimately determined by the unique elements in `c` and their frequencies, not the order in which they are added.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the frequency of each element in `arr` using a frequency array `freq` of size `n+1`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the frequency array `freq` to find the smallest index `i` such that `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1. This index `i` is the MEX of the array.

#### Key Insight:
- The MEX of the final array `c` is determined by the unique elements in `arr` and their frequencies.
- The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob does not change the fact that the MEX is simply the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr` or appearing only once.

#### Validation Using Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The state before the function call indicates that `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`.
- The frequency array `freq` correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
- The loop correctly identifies the smallest index `i` such that `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1, which is the MEX.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequencies of elements, which is the optimal result for the game when both players play optimally. The annotations support this conclusion by verifying the state of the program at key points.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
