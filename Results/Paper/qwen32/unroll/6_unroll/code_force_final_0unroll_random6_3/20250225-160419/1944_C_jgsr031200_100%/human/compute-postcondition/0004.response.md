The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n + 1`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n + 1`. If `n + 1` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `arr`, `freq`, and `cou` does not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

However, for the loop to start executing, `n + 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 0. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, `freq` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where each index `j` of `freq` contains the count of how many times the integer `j` appears in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0**
