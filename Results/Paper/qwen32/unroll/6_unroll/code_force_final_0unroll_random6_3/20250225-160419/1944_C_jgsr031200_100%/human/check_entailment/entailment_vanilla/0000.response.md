Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a`, appending it to `c`, and deleting it from `a`.
- Bob then picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game continues until `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to minimize it.
- We need to determine the final score if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **MEX Definition**: MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX by including numbers in `c` that delay the inclusion of smaller numbers.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX by including smaller numbers in `c` as soon as possible.
3. **Strategy**:
   - If any number appears at least twice, it can be ignored for the purpose of determining the MEX.
   - The first two unique numbers (if they exist) will determine the MEX.
   - If there are no unique numbers, the MEX is 0.
   - If there is exactly one unique number, the MEX is that number.
   - If there are at least two unique numbers, the MEX is the smaller of the two.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and processes each one by counting the frequency of each number in the array. It then checks the frequency of numbers to determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy.

#### Key Code Snippet:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
```

#### Explanation:
- `freq` array counts the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
- The loop iterates through possible numbers from 0 to `n`.
- It skips numbers that appear at least twice (`freq[i] >= 2`).
- It counts the unique numbers (`freq[i] == 1`).
- The first number that either makes the count of unique numbers reach 2 or is not present in `arr` (`freq[i] == 0`) is printed as the MEX.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy. It efficiently counts the frequency of numbers and determines the MEX by considering the smallest two unique numbers or the first missing number.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem as per the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
