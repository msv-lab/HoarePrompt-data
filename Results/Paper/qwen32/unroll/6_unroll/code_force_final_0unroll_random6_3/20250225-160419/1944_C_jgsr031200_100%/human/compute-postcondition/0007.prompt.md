You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n, and n is the length of arr. The function will be called multiple times with different arrays, and the sum of all n values across these arrays does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `freq` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where each index `j` of `freq` contains the count of how many times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, `freq` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `freq[j]` is the count of how many times the integer `j` appears in `arr`, and `cou` is 2 if the loop breaks after finding the second unique element or the value of `cou` before the loop breaks if it encounters a zero frequency element first. The loop prints the value of `i` at the point of breaking.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. The function returns a value based on the properties of the list `arr`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
