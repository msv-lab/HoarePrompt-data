Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to calculate the area of the square by comparing the squared distances between two pairs of points. However, it does not correctly identify the pairs of points that form the sides of the square. The program should instead calculate the squared distances between all pairs of points and identify the smallest non-zero distance, which corresponds to the side length of the square. The area of the square would then be the square of this side length.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        points = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        distances = []
        
        # Calculate squared distances between all pairs of points
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i + 1, 4):
                dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0]
                dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1]
                distances.append(dx * dx + dy * dy)
        
        # The smallest non-zero distance is the side length squared
        side_length_squared = min(d for d in distances if d > 0)
        area = side_length_squared
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the squared distance between all pairs of points, finds the smallest non-zero distance, and uses that to determine the area of the square.
