The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100. After executing the code snippet, the value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other parts of the initial state, including the coordinates of the corners of the squares, are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.**
