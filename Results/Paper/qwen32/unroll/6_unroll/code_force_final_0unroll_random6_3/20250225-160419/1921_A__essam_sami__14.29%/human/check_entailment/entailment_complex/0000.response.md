Reasoning:  
The program is intended to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The area of a square can be determined by calculating the squared distance between any two opposite corners and then taking the square root of that distance squared, but since the area is the side length squared, we can directly use the squared distance as the area.

The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances. However, in a square, all four sides are of equal length, and the diagonals are also of equal length. Therefore, the squared distances between opposite corners (which are the diagonals) should be the same. The program correctly identifies and prints the squared distance, which is the area of the square.

The program correctly handles the input format, reads the number of test cases, and processes each test case independently. It also correctly computes and outputs the area of the square for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
