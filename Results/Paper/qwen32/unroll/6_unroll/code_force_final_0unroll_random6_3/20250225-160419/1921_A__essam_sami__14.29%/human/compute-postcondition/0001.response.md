The only variables in the loop head are `steps` and `t`. The variable `steps` is the loop variable that will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during each iteration of the loop. The variable `t` is the number of iterations the loop will execute, which is determined by the input value.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The value of `steps` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized automatically by the `range` function in each iteration.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for `steps` since it is controlled by the loop. However, we should ensure that `t` is within the specified range to guarantee that the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100**
