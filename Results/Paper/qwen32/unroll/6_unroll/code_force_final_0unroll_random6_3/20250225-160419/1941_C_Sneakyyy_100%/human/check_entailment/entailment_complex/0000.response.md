### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to ensure it does not contain the substrings "map" or "pie". The program iterates through each test case, and for each string, it counts non-overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie" and outputs this count.

However, the program does not correctly address the problem because it only counts non-overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie" and removes them, but it does not guarantee that the resulting string is beautiful. The program does not consider overlapping occurrences or the possibility that removing one occurrence might create another.

For example, consider the string "ppiepieeee". The program would count "pie" at indices 1-3 and 4-6, and remove 2 characters. However, after removing these, the string becomes "ppieee", which still contains "pie" at indices 1-3. The program should have removed 2 characters to make the string beautiful, but it only removed 2 characters and left "pie" in the string.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that removing one occurrence of "map" or "pie" might create another occurrence that needs to be removed. It also does not ensure that the resulting string is beautiful after processing.
