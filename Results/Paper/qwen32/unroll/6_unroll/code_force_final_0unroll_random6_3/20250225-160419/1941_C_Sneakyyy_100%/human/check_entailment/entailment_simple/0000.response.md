### Reasoning:

The provided program is supposed to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful (i.e., to remove all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie"). The program does this by iterating through the string and checking for these substrings. If it finds "map" or "pie", it increments the answer counter and skips the next two characters (since the substring is of length 3). Otherwise, it moves one character forward.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program only counts non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". For example, in the string "mapie", the program will only count one occurrence and remove three characters, resulting in "ie", which still contains "pie". Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" and find a way to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all such substrings. The provided program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
