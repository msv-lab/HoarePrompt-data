Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- We need to handle multiple test cases, each with its own string `s`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
- It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of deletions.
- It uses a while loop to iterate through the string `s` in steps of 1 or 3, depending on whether it finds the substrings "pie" or "map".
- If a "pie" or "map" is found, it increments `ans` by 1 and skips the next 2 characters.
- If neither "pie" nor "map" is found, it simply moves to the next character.
- Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues with the Program:
- The logic of incrementing `i` by 3 when "pie" or "map" is found is incorrect. This approach assumes that removing one occurrence of "pie" or "map" will not affect the next possible occurrence, which is not necessarily true.
- For example, consider the string "ppiepie". The program would only count one deletion, but actually, two deletions are needed to make it beautiful.
- The program does not account for overlapping occurrences of "pie" or "map".

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
