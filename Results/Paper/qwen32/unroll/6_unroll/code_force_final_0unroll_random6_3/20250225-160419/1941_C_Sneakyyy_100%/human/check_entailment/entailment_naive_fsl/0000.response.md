Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where the substrings "pie" or "map" appear in the string. Specifically, the program only checks for these substrings in non-overlapping blocks of three characters and increments the count by 1 when a match is found. This approach fails to account for cases where the removal of a single character can break multiple occurrences of the substrings "pie" or "map".

For example, consider the input string "ppiepie". The correct answer should be 2, as removing the second 'p' and the second 'i' would make the string "ppiee", which does not contain "pie" or "map". However, the provided program would only count one occurrence of "pie" and return 1, which is incorrect.

Here's a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
7
ppiepie
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
1
```

This demonstrates that the program does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings "pie" or "map" correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
