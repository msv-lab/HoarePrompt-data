Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful by ensuring it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The current implementation counts non-overlapping occurrences of these substrings and removes them by skipping three characters ahead when a match is found, then increments the answer counter.

However, the approach has a critical flaw: it does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings "pie" or "map" correctly. For example, consider the string "mapie": the program will identify "map" and remove it, but then it will skip the next character and not detect "pie". Thus, it will incorrectly output 1 instead of 2.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider overlapping cases and find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "pie" or "map". This likely requires a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach that carefully considers each character and its impact on forming the substrings "pie" or "map".

Since the program does not correctly handle overlapping substrings, it does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions, making it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
