You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of the pairs for each test case.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Each element in the list `ans_f` is printed on a new line. The state of `ans_f` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on a whiteboard, followed by 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the pairs of integers provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
