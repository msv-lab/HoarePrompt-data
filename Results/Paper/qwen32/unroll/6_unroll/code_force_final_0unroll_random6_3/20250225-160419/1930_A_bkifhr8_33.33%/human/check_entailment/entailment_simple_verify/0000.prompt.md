You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum final score by optimally performing the n moves. The main issue lies in the way the program handles the removal of elements from the list. The code attempts to remove elements using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which is incorrect and will lead to errors or incorrect results.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements**: The code uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements from the list. This is problematic because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always evaluate to `0` and `2` respectively, regardless of the loop iteration. This means the code will always try to remove the first and third elements of the list, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Logic for Selecting Minimum Pairs**: The code should sort the list and then pair the smallest elements together to maximize the score. However, the current logic does not sort the list and does not correctly handle the selection and removal of pairs.

3. **Handling of List Length**: The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not correctly handling the pairing logic. The code should always pair the smallest two elements and remove them from the list until all elements are processed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to pair the smallest elements together
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]  # Add the smaller of each pair to the score
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version, the list is sorted, and then the program iterates through the list in steps of 2, adding the smaller element of each pair to the score. This ensures that the maximum score is achieved by always pairing the smallest available elements.
