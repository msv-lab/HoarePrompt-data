Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on a whiteboard, followed by 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the pairs of integers provided.**
