Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two numbers from a list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing those two numbers from the list. We need to perform this operation exactly `n` times, where `n` is half the number of integers in the list.

### Key Points:
1. **Sorting**: To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to pair the smallest numbers together. This ensures that we are adding the smallest possible values to the score in each step.
2. **Implementation**: The program should:
   - Read multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - Sort the list of integers.
   - Sum up the smallest `n` integers (which are the first `n` elements in the sorted list).
   - Output the sum for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Pairing Logic**: The program does not sort the list before processing it. It simply takes the first two elements, adds the smaller one to the score, and removes them. This does not guarantee that we are always adding the smallest possible values to the score.
2. **Incorrect Indexing in List Removal**: The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. The expression `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always evaluate to `0` and `2` respectively, which is not the intended behavior. Even if the list were sorted, these lines would not correctly remove the first two elements in each iteration.
3. **Unnecessary Condition**: The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not necessary and does not handle the list correctly when there are only two elements left.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the list of integers.
2. Sum the first `n` elements of the sorted list.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to maximize the score. It fails to sort the list and incorrectly handles the removal of elements.

**Correctness: False**
