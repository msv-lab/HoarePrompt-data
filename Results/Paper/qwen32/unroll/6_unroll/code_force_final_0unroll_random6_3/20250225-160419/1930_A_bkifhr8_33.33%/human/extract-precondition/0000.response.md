Precondition: **Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases.**
