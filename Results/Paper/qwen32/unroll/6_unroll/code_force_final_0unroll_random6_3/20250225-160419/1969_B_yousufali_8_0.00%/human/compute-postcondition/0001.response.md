In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations specified by the range function. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to ignore the loop index, it does not need to be adjusted. The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0**
