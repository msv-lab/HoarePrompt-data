Reasoning: 
The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case. `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operation.

However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` currently processes the input as a list of integers, which is not the correct input format for a binary string. The problem specifies that the input is a binary string (a string of '0's and '1's), not a list of integers.

The logic inside `func_1` also does not match the problem requirements. The function counts the number of '1's and accumulates a cost based on the positions of '0's and the count of '1's encountered before each '0'. This logic does not correspond to the minimum cost calculation for sorting the binary string using cyclic shifts.

Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the provided code, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
