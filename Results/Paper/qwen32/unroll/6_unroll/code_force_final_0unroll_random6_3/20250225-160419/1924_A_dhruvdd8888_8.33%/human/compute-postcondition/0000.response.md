The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. The initial state specifies the ranges for these variables and provides additional context about the input data.

Given the initial state, the code will update the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` based on the input. Since the input values are not provided, we will describe the output state in terms of these variables taking on the values specified by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; the string `s` is of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, while `n`, `k`, and `m` take on the specific values provided by the input. The string `s` and its properties remain as described in the initial state.
