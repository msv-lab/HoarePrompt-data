To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in `s`.
- `ps` is the number of such sequences found, and `ps` is less than `n`.

### Code of the loop:
```python
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `us`.
- For each `i`, it checks if `i` is not in the set `win`.
- If `i` is not in `win`, it prints a string constructed by concatenating:
  - The joined elements of the list `ans`.
  - The character `i`.
  - The character `'a'` repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

### Output State:
- The loop will print a string for each unique character `i` in `us` that is not already in `win`.
- The set `win` will accumulate all characters `i` that were printed.
- The list `ans` and the variable `ps` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The loop prints strings but does not modify `win`, `ans`, or `ps`. The only change is that `win` will contain all unique characters from `us` that were printed.

Output State: **win is a set containing all unique characters from `us` that were printed; ans is unchanged; ps is unchanged.**
