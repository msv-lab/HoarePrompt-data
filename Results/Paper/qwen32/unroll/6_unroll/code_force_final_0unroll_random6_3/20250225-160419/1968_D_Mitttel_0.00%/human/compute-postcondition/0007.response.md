Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `PB` and `PS` are integers such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n, `p` is a list of integers of length n where each element is between 1 and n, `a` is a list of integers of length n where each element is a positive integer, `bodya_score` is the value returned by `calculate_score(PB)`, `sasha_score` is the value returned by `calculate_score(PS)`, and `bodya_score` is greater than or equal to `sasha_score`**
