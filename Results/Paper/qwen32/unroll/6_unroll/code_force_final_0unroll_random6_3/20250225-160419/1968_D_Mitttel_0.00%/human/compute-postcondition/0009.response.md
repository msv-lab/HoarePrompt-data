Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. Here, `n` and `k` are positive integers, `PB` and `PS` are integers between 1 and `n`, `p` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and `n`, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is a positive integer. The function returns 'Bodya' in Case_1, 'Sasha' in Case_2, and 'Draw' in Case_3.**
