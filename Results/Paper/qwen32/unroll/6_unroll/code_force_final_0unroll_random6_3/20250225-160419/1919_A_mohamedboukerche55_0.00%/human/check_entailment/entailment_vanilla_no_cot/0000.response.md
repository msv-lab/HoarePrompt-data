Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Indentation Error**: The `if` and `else` statements are not properly indented. They should be inside the `for` loop to ensure they process each test case.

2. **Incorrect Output**: The program incorrectly prints 'bob' followed by two spaces and 'alice' without spaces, which does not match the expected output format.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic to determine the winner is incorrect. The winner is determined based on whether the sum of coins `(a + b)` is odd or even, but the names are printed in reverse. According to the problem, if the sum is even, Bob wins, and if the sum is odd, Alice wins. However, the program prints 'bob' when the sum is even, which is correct, but it prints 'alice' with extra spaces, which is incorrect.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the logic is applied correctly and the output format matches the requirements.
