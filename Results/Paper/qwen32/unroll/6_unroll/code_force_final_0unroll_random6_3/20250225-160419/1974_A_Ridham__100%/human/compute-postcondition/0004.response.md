To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the components and the operations involved.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Initial State:
- `result` is a list containing the calculated number of screens required for each test case based on the given conditions.

### Analysis:
1. **`map(str, result)`**:
   - The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in the `result` list. This converts each element of the `result` list to a string.
   - For example, if `result` is `[3, 5, 2]`, then `map(str, result)` will produce an iterator that yields `"3"`, `"5"`, and `"2"`.

2. **`'\n'.join(...)`**:
   - The `join` method concatenates the elements of the iterator produced by `map(str, result)` into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - Continuing the example, `'\n'.join(["3", "5", "2"])` will produce the string `"3\n5\n2"`.

### Output:
The final output will be a single string where each element of the `result` list is converted to a string and separated by newline characters.

### Final Answer:
Output: **Each element of the `result` list printed on a new line (where each element is the number of screens required for a test case)**

If we had a specific `result` list, we could provide a more concrete example. For instance, if `result` were `[3, 5, 2]`, the output would be:
Output: **3\n5\n2**

But without the specific values of `result`, the most precise description is:
Output: **Each element of the `result` list printed on a new line (where each element is the number of screens required for a test case)**
