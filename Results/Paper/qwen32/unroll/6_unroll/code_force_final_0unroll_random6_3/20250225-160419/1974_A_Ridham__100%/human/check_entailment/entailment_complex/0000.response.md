### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic and correctness of the provided program step by step.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading two integers `x` and `y` for each test case. These integers represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the total space required for 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - `space_x = x * 1` calculates the space required for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4` calculates the space required for 2x2 icons.
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x` calculates the total space required for all icons.

3. **Calculating Screens Required for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`. This calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, two 2x2 icons can fit in one 5x3 screen (which has 15 cells).

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` calculates the remaining cells in the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.

5. **Calculating Screens Required for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means that all 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells of the screens already allocated for 2x2 icons.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the extra space required for 1x1 icons and determines the number of additional screens needed. The formula `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (1 if extra_space % 15 != 0 else 0)` correctly calculates the number of additional screens required.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list and prints the results.

### Correctness:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case by first placing the 2x2 icons and then fitting the 1x1 icons in the remaining space or additional screens if needed. The logic handles edge cases such as when there are no icons or when the number of 2x2 icons is odd, requiring an extra screen.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
