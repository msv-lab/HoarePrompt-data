Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed in all cases. The logic for handling the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and then placing the 1x1 icons is flawed.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program assumes that after placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells can be perfectly filled by 1x1 icons. However, it does not consider the grid structure and the fact that placing 2x2 icons can leave irregular spaces that cannot be filled by 1x1 icons without additional screens.
2. The calculation of `remaining_cells` does not correctly account for the grid structure. It simply subtracts the space occupied by 2x2 icons from the total grid space, which can lead to incorrect results when the remaining space cannot be perfectly filled by 1x1 icons due to the grid's dimensions.
3. The program does not consider different possible placements of 2x2 icons, which might lead to more efficient use of the grid.

To fix the program, a more sophisticated approach is needed that takes into account the grid structure and tries different placements of 2x2 icons to minimize the number of screens required.
