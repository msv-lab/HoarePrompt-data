Let's break down the problem and analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means there are 15 cells per screen.
2. **Icon Sizes**:
   - 1x1 icons take 1 cell each.
   - 2x2 icons take 4 cells each.
3. **Objective**: Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x`: Total cells needed for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y`: Total cells needed for 2x2 icons.
   - `total_space`: Sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, the minimum number of screens required to accommodate `y` such icons is calculated. The formula used is:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
     This is because each screen can hold at most 3 2x2 icons (since 3 * 4 = 12, and the remaining 3 cells can't fit another 2x2 icon).

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells`: This is the number of cells left on the screens used for 2x2 icons after placing all `y` 2x2 icons.
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `space_x` (total cells needed for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, all 1x1 icons can be placed on the screens already used for 2x2 icons.
   - If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, the program calculates the number of additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
     - `extra_screen` is calculated based on how many full screens are needed to accommodate `extra_space` cells.
     - The final number of screens is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program logic seems to be correctly accounting for the constraints and objectives of the problem. It calculates the minimum number of screens required for 2x2 icons first, then determines if the remaining cells can accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Test Cases:
The provided test cases match the expected output, which suggests that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
