Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - Players place rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - Players alternate turns, with the first player placing white rooks and the second player placing black rooks.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (i.e., no two rooks in the same row or column).
   - If a player places a rook at (r, c), the opponent places a rook at (c, r) unless r = c, in which case the opponent skips the turn.
   - The task is to determine the number of distinct final configurations after k moves, with the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Points:**
   - Each move reduces the number of available positions.
   - If a move is at (r, c) with r ≠ c, both positions (r, c) and (c, r) are occupied.
   - If a move is at (r, r), only that position is occupied.

### Program Analysis Recap:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the chessboard) and `k` (number of moves already played).
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the first player's moves.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a ≠ b`, it reduces `n` by 2 (since both (a, b) and (b, a) are occupied).
   - If `a = b`, it reduces `n` by 1 (since only (a, a) is occupied).

3. **Calculating Configurations:**
   - After processing the moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an n x n chessboard.

4. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1(n)`:**
   - The function initializes a list `dp` with the first two values as 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list based on the formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - The formula is derived from the problem of counting non-attacking rook placements on a chessboard.

### Annotations and Verification:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).
  - Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move, where \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\).
  - It is guaranteed that the `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

- **State inside `func_1(n)`:**
  - The program returns `dp[n]`, which is computed using the dynamic programming formula.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Input Handling and Move Processing:**
  - The program correctly processes the moves and reduces `n` based on the rules.
  - For each move `(a, b)`:
    - If `a ≠ b`, both positions (a, b) and (b, a) are occupied, so `n` is reduced by 2.
    - If `a = b`, only position (a, a) is occupied, so `n` is reduced by 1.
  - This reduction correctly reflects the number of remaining positions available for placing rooks.

- **Dynamic Programming Formula:**
  - The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)` is used to count the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an i x i chessboard.
  - This formula is derived from the combinatorial problem of placing rooks, and it is correct for this purpose.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly computes and prints the number of possible final configurations for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles the input, processes the moves, and calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
