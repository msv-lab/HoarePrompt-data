Given the initial state, the list `dp` contains at least `n` elements, and the code returns the last element of the list `dp`. Since the last element of the list `dp` is `dp[-1]`, which is also `dp[n]` based on the initial state, the program returns `dp[n]`.

Output State: **The program returns `dp[n]`**
