You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    print(func_1(n))
    continue

def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        dp.pop(0)
    return dp[-1]



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and returns the value of `dp[n]`, where `dp` is a list computed based on a specific recurrence relation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - You place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (i.e., no two rooks in the same row or column).
   - If you place a rook at (r, c), the computer places a black rook at (c, r) unless r = c, in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - You have already played k moves, and the computer has mirrored these moves where possible.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the number of different final configurations possible after continuing the game from the given state.
   - The result should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Key Points:**
   - Each move you make reduces the number of available positions for future moves.
   - If you place a rook at (r, c) with r ≠ c, both (r, c) and (c, r) are occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 2.
   - If you place a rook at (r, r), only that position is occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 1.
   - The problem can be reduced to finding the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining unoccupied positions.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the chessboard) and `k` (number of moves already played).
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing your moves.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a ≠ b`, it reduces `n` by 2 (since both (a, b) and (b, a) are occupied).
   - If `a = b`, it reduces `n` by 1 (since only (a, a) is occupied).

3. **Calculating Configurations:**
   - After processing the moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an n x n chessboard.

4. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1(n)`:**
   - The function initializes a list `dp` with the first two values as 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list based on the formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - The formula is derived from the problem of counting non-attacking rook placements on a chessboard.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the moves to reduce the number of available positions.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1(n)` is appropriate for counting the number of non-attacking rook placements.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the analysis. It correctly handles the input, processes the moves, and calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming.

Correctness: **True**
