Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - You place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (i.e., no two rooks in the same row or column).
   - If you place a rook at (r, c), the computer places a black rook at (c, r) unless r = c, in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - You have already played k moves, and the computer has mirrored these moves where possible.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the number of different final configurations possible after continuing the game from the given state.
   - The result should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Key Points:**
   - Each move you make reduces the number of available positions for future moves.
   - If you place a rook at (r, c) with r ≠ c, both (r, c) and (c, r) are occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 2.
   - If you place a rook at (r, r), only that position is occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 1.
   - The problem can be reduced to finding the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining unoccupied positions.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the chessboard) and `k` (number of moves already played).
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing your moves.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a ≠ b`, it reduces `n` by 2 (since both (a, b) and (b, a) are occupied).
   - If `a = b`, it reduces `n` by 1 (since only (a, a) is occupied).

3. **Calculating Configurations:**
   - After processing the moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an n x n chessboard.

4. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1(n)`:**
   - The function initializes a list `dp` with the first two values as 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list based on the formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - The formula is derived from the problem of counting non-attacking rook placements on a chessboard.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the moves to reduce the number of available positions.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1(n)` is appropriate for counting the number of non-attacking rook placements.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the analysis. It correctly handles the input, processes the moves, and calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming.

Correctness: **True**
