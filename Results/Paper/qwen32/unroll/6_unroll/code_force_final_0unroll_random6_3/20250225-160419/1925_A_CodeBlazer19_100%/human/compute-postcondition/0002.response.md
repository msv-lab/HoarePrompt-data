Output State: **The variable `i` will have the value `t-1` after the loop completes, as it will have iterated through all values from `0` to `t-1`. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last test case input. The string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n will have been printed `t` times, each corresponding to the inputs of each test case. The initial value of `t` will remain unchanged as it is only used to control the loop iterations.**
