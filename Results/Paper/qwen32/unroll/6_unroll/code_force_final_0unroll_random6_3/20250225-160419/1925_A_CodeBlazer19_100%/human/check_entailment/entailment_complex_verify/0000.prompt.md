You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives no direct input parameters. Instead, it reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be formed and the number of first lowercase English alphabets to be used, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
        
    #State: The variable `i` will have the value `t-1` after the loop completes, as it will have iterated through all values from `0` to `t-1`. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last test case input. The string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n will have been printed `t` times, each corresponding to the inputs of each test case. The initial value of `t` will remain unchanged as it is only used to control the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from standard input the number of test cases and, for each test case, two integers representing the length of the string to be formed and the number of first lowercase English alphabets to be used. It then prints a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Instead, it simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` appear as subsequences in the generated string.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

For the input:
```
2
2 2
```

The program will output:
```
aabb
```

However, the correct output should be `baab` or `abab` (or any other string of length 4 that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the letters 'a' and 'b'). The string `aabb` does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2:
- `ab` is missing from `aabb`.
- `ba` is missing from `aabb`.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements and is incorrect.
