You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES

    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t is 0, and variables s, a, newstr, and isreverse do not retain any specific value after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the string `s`.
3. It then creates a set `a` from the characters of `s` to determine the number of unique characters.
4. If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in the string, so it's possible to rearrange the string to be different from the original.
5. The program then attempts to create a new string `newstr` by splitting the string `s` into two halves and swapping them.
6. It checks if `newstr` is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `YES` and the new string.
7. If `newstr` is the same as `s`, it checks if the reverse of `s` is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `YES` and the reverse of `s`.
8. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints `YES` and a different rearrangement of `s` (specifically, the second half of `s` followed by the first character of the first half). However, this rearrangement is not guaranteed to be different from `s` if `s` has an even length and is symmetric.
9. If the length of the set `a` is not greater than 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, so it prints `NO`.

The logic for rearranging the string to be different from the original is flawed in the last part of the code. Specifically, the rearrangement `s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]` is not guaranteed to be different from `s` if `s` is symmetric or has an even length. For example, for the string "xxxyy", the rearrangement would be "yyxxxy", which is different, but for the string "xxxx", the rearrangement would be "xxxx", which is the same.

However, the program does correctly handle the cases where all characters are the same and where there are multiple unique characters and can generate a valid rearrangement in those cases.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program does not always generate a correct rearrangement when it is possible, so the program is not entirely correct.
