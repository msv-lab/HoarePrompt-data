Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be an integer read from the input. The precondition that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000 is still valid. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
