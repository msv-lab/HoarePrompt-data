You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of card types `n`, a number of coins `k`, and a list of integers representing the initial count of each card type. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the distribution of coins among the card types, aiming to maximize the minimum number of cards of any type by using the coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The problem requires us to find the maximum score we can achieve by rearranging cards after potentially buying additional cards. The score is defined as the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of the numbers `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of distinct card types) and `k` (the number of additional cards that can be bought).
   - It then reads a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial count of each card type.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted. This step is critical because it helps in determining the minimum number of cards needed to balance the counts of each type.

3. **Balancing Card Counts:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted counts to balance them by using the available `k` cards.
   - It calculates the difference `dif` between consecutive counts and attempts to equalize them by using `k` cards.
   - If `k` is sufficient to balance the counts, it reduces `k` accordingly.
   - If `k` is not sufficient, it distributes the remaining `k` cards as evenly as possible among the counts.

4. **Calculating the Score:**
   - After balancing the counts, the program calculates the score.
   - The formula used to calculate the score is `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, where `ans` is the minimum count after balancing and `res` is the number of card types that still have the minimum count after balancing.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Formula for Score Calculation:**
  - The formula used to calculate the score `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res` is incorrect. This formula does not accurately represent the number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed.
  - The correct approach would involve calculating the number of valid permutations based on the counts of each card type after balancing.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score for the given problem. The logic for balancing the card counts seems reasonable, but the formula for calculating the score is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
