The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans_list`. This action does not affect any of the other variables or their values. The initial state includes the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of cards of each type initially available. The total number of test cases `t` and the sum of `n` over all test cases are also part of the initial state.

Since `ans_list` is initialized as an empty list, the only change in the output state is the introduction of this new list. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **Each test case contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. Additionally, the test case contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12) representing the number of cards of type i initially available. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is given at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. `ans_list` is an empty list.**
