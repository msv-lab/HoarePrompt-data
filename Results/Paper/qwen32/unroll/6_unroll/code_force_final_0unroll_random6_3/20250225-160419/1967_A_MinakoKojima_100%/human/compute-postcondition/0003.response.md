The only variable in the loop head is `a` and the list `ans_list`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ans_list`. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `result1, result2, ..., resultt` does not affect the execution of the loop, so we do not need to adjust them.

For the loop to execute, `ans_list` must have at least one element. The variable `a` will take the value of the first element in `ans_list`.

State: **`[result1, result2, ..., resultt]`, `ans_list` must have at least one element, `a` is the first element of `ans_list`**
