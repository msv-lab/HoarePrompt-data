Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of distinct types of cards and `k` is the number of coins. It also accepts a list of `n` integers representing the number of cards of each type initially available. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
