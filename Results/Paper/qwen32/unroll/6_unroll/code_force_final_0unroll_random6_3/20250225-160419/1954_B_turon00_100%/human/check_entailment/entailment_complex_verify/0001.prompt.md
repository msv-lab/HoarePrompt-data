You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

    #State: All test cases processed with `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` being reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum length of a contiguous subarray within `a` that contains all distinct elements of `a`. If no such subarray exists (i.e., all elements in `a` are the same), it returns `-1`. The function outputs the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing the operation of replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by counting the longest contiguous subsequence of identical numbers and then using this count to determine the answer. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the code:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array, `cnt` to 0, and `ans` to `n`.
3. **Counting Contiguous Subsequences**: The program iterates over the array:
   - If the current element is the same as `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element is different from `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
4. **Final Count Update**: After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to consider the last contiguous subsequence.
5. **Decision Making**: The program then checks if the array has only one element (`n == 1`) or if the longest contiguous subsequence is the entire array (`ans == n`). If either condition is true, it prints `-1` (indicating that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements). Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The main issue is that it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The logic of counting the longest contiguous subsequence and then using its length does not account for the fact that we need to remove elements in such a way that the resulting array cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to consider the correct approach for determining the minimum number of elements to remove.

Correctness: **False**
