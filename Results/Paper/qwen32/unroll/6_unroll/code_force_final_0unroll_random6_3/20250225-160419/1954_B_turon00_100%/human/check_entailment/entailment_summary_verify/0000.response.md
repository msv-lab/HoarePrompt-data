Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap
An array is considered "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array and counting contiguous segments of identical elements. It keeps track of the minimum length of such segments and uses it to determine the result.

#### Function Summary
The function summary suggests that the code calculates the minimum length of a contiguous subarray within `a` that contains all distinct elements of `a`. However, this is not the correct interpretation of the problem.

#### Code Logic
1. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `cnt` counts the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `ans` keeps track of the minimum length of such segments.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the array, if it matches `tmp`, increment `cnt`.
   - If it doesn't match, update `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, then reset `cnt` to 1 and update `tmp` to the current element.
   - After the loop, `ans` is updated one last time to consider the final segment.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - If the array length `n` is 1 or the minimum segment length `ans` equals `n`, print `-1` (indicating the array is already uniform and cannot be made non-beautiful by removal).
   - Otherwise, print `ans`.

### Evaluation Against Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the provided code is incorrect, citing a counterexample where the code outputs `3` for an input that should output `2`.

#### Counterexample Analysis
Consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 5 5 3
```
- The code will identify segments of `3`s and `5`s.
- The minimum segment length `ans` will be `3` (for either segment of `3`s or `5`s).
- Since `ans` is not `n` (7), the code will output `3`.

This output is indeed incorrect. The correct approach should consider removing elements in such a way that the resulting array cannot be made uniform by the allowed operation. For the given example, removing two `3`s (either the first two or the last two) results in an array that cannot be made uniform.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic of finding the minimum segment length of identical elements does not align with the problem requirements.

**Final: False**
