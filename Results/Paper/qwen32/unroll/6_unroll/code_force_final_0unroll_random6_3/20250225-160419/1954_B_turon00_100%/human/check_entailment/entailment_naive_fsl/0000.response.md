Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and find a potential counterexample.

The program attempts to find the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are the same (`cnt`) and then calculates the minimum number of elements to remove (`ans`). However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will stop being beautiful after removing the minimum number of elements.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
7
3 3 3 5 5 5 3

Expected Output:
2

Explanation:
To make the array stop being beautiful, we can remove two elements. For example, removing the first and last '3' results in [3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5], which is still beautiful. However, removing the first two '3's or the last two '3's results in [3, 5, 5, 5, 3], which is not beautiful.
```

The provided program would output `3` for this input, which is incorrect. The program does not correctly account for the possibility of removing elements in such a way that the resulting array is not beautiful.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
