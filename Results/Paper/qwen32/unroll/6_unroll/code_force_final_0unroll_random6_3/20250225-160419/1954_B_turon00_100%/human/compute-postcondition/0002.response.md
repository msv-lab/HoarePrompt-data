To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the code does for each test case and then generalize it for all `t` test cases.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Outer Loop (`for _ in range(t)`):** This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop (`for i in range(n)`):** For each test case, it processes an array `a` of length `n`.
3. **Variables:**
   - `tmp`: Stores the first element of the array `a`.
   - `cnt`: Counts the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans`: Keeps track of the minimum length of a segment of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.

### What the Code Does:
- It initializes `tmp` with the first element of `a`.
- It initializes `cnt` to 0 and `ans` to `n`.
- It iterates through the array `a` and counts the length of segments where elements are equal to `tmp`.
- When it encounters an element different from `tmp`, it updates `ans` with the minimum length of such segments and resets `cnt`.
- After the loop, it performs a final update to `ans` with the last counted segment.
- If `n == 1` or `ans == n`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Output State:
Since the code processes each test case independently and the state of variables `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are reset for each test case, the final state of these variables after all iterations will be the state they are initialized to at the start of the next test case.

### Output State Format:
Output State: **`tmp` is reset to the first element of the next test case's array `a`, `cnt` is reset to 0, and `ans` is reset to `n` for the next test case.**

However, since we are asked to describe the output state after all iterations, and these variables are reset for each test case, we can describe the final state after all test cases are processed as:

Output State: **All test cases processed with `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` being reset for each new test case.**
