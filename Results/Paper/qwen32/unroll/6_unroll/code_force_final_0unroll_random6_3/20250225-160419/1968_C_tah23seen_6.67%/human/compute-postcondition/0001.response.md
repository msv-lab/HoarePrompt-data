The code snippet updates the first element of the `ans` list to be the first element of the `arr` list plus one. The other elements of `ans` remain unchanged, and the initial conditions for `arr`, `n`, and the other elements of `ans` still hold.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr); `n` is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and the remaining elements are 0.**
