#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: ans = [arr[0] + 1, smallest multiple of ans[1] >= arr[1], smallest multiple of ans[2] >= arr[2], ..., 0]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' where the first element is arr[0] + 1, the second element is the smallest multiple of ans[1] that is greater than or equal to arr[1], the third element is the smallest multiple of ans[2] that is greater than or equal to arr[2], and so on until the last element which is ans[-2] + arr[-1].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n` (where `n` is the length of `arr` plus one). It returns a list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element is the smallest multiple of the previous element in `ans` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element in `ans` and the last element in `arr`.
