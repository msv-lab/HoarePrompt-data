Output State: **The program returns a list 'ans' where the first element is arr[0] + 1, the second element is the smallest multiple of ans[1] that is greater than or equal to arr[1], the third element is the smallest multiple of ans[2] that is greater than or equal to arr[2], and so on until the last element which is ans[-2] + arr[-1].**

In simpler terms, the program returns the list `ans` as it is, with each element defined by the rules specified in the initial state description.
