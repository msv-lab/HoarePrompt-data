### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of distributing bets in a game such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for any winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic and correctness based on the given input-output examples and the annotated states:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).

2. **Computing LCM:**
   - The program calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers. This is done using a helper function `func_1(a, b)` which calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).
   - The LCM of all multipliers is stored in the variable `den`.

3. **Generating Bets:**
   - The program then generates a list `vprod` where each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the product of each bet and its multiplier will be equal to the LCM.
   - The program then calculates the remaining amount (`den`) after subtracting the sum of `vprod` from the LCM.
   - If the remaining amount (`den`) is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` because it's not possible to distribute the bets in such a way that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - If the remaining amount is positive, it prints the list `vprod` as the bets.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1:**
       - Input: `3 3 2 7`
       - LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`.
       - `vprod` is `[14, 21, 6]`.
       - Total bet is `42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1`.
       - For each winning outcome, received amount is `3*14 = 42`, `2*21 = 42`, `7*6 = 42`, which is greater than the total bet `1`.
       - Output: `27 41 12` (Note: The provided output `27 41 12` is different from the expected output `[14, 21, 6]` based on the program's logic, but the logic itself is correct for any valid `vprod` that satisfies the conditions).
     - **Example 2:**
       - Input: `2 3 3`
       - LCM of `[3, 3]` is `3`.
       - `vprod` is `[1, 1]`.
       - Total bet is `3 - (1 + 1) = 1`.
       - For each winning outcome, received amount is `3*1 = 3`, which is greater than the total bet `1`.
       - Output: `1 1`.
     - **Example 3:**
       - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
       - LCM of `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` is `5`.
       - `vprod` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
       - Total bet is `5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0`.
       - Since the total bet is not strictly less than the received amount, the output is `-1`.
     - **Example 4:**
       - Input: `6 7 9 3 17 9 13`
       - LCM of `[7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]` is `14322`.
       - `vprod` is `[2046, 1591, 4774, 842, 1591, 1101]`.
       - Total bet is `14322 - (2046 + 1591 + 4774 + 842 + 1591 + 1101) = 2477`.
       - For each winning outcome, the received amount is greater than `2477`.
       - Output: `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071` (Note: The provided output `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071` is different from the expected output `[2046, 1591, 4774, 842, 1591, 1101]` based on the program's logic, but the logic itself is correct for any valid `vprod` that satisfies the conditions).
     - **Example 5:**
       - Input: `3 6 3 2`
       - LCM of `[6, 3, 2]` is `6`.
       - `vprod` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
       - Total bet is `6 - (1 + 2 + 3) = 0`.
       - Since the total bet is not strictly less than the received amount, the output is `-1`.
     - **Example 6:**
       - Input: `5 9 4 6 8 3`
       - LCM of `[9, 4, 6, 8, 3]` is `72`.
       - `vprod` is `[8, 18, 12, 9, 24]`.
       - Total bet is `72 - (8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24) = 1`.
       - For each winning outcome, the received amount is greater than `1`.
       - Output: `8 18 12 9 24`.

The program's logic is sound and correctly implements the required conditions for the problem. However, the provided outputs in the example do not match the expected outputs based on the program's logic. Despite this discrepancy, the program itself is correct in terms of its logic and approach.
