To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the input values `n` and `k` for each iteration.

The loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration:
- If `n == k`, it prints 'YES', followed by `1` (the number of coins spent), and `1` (the number of jewels bought).
- If `n + 2 > k * 2`, it prints 'YES', followed by `2` (the number of coins spent), and then the number of coins spent on the first and second jewel (which are `n - k + 1` and `1` respectively).
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

After all iterations, the variables `n` and `k` will have no specific values as they are reassigned in each iteration of the loop. The only variable that retains its value after the loop is `t`, as it controls the number of iterations.

The output state will include the series of outputs generated by each iteration of the loop, but since we are asked to describe the state of the variables after the loop, we focus on the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Since `n` and `k` are overwritten in each iteration, their final values are not predictable without knowing the specific inputs for the last iteration. However, `t` remains unchanged after the loop.

Thus, the output state in terms of variable states is:

Output State: **`t` remains the same as the initial input integer, while `n` and `k` are the values from the last iteration of the loop.**
