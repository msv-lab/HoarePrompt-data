You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`, and two integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates how many times a sliding window of size `m` over list `a` has at least `k` common elements with list `b`. The function prints the count of such occurrences for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step:

### Program Analysis

The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the initial subsegment of `a` and in `b`. It then iterates over the remaining subsegments of `a` to check if they are "good" according to the problem's criteria.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, read the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Initial Counters**: Create counters for the first `m` elements of `a` (`cnt_aa`) and for `b` (`cnt_bb`).
3. **Intersection and Difference**: Compute the intersection (`D`) and differences (`E` and `C`) between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`.
4. **Initial Check**: Check if the number of matching elements in the first subsegment is at least `k`.
5. **Sliding Window**: For each subsequent subsegment, update the counters by removing the element that is sliding out of the window (`out_aa`) and adding the element that is sliding into the window (`in_aa`). Adjust the intersection (`D`), difference (`E`), and complement (`C`) accordingly.
6. **Count Good Subsegments**: For each updated subsegment, check if the number of matching elements is at least `k` and count it if true.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases and meets the problem requirements:

1. **Initial Subsegment**: The program correctly initializes the counters for the first `m` elements of `a` and `b` and checks if the intersection meets the criteria.
2. **Sliding Window**: The program uses an efficient sliding window approach to update the counters, ensuring that the solution is optimal for large inputs.
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - **Minimum `k`**: When `k=1`, the program should count all subsegments that have at least one matching element.
    - **Maximum `k`**: When `k=m`, the program should count only those subsegments where all elements match.
    - **Unique Elements**: The program should handle cases where all elements in `a` and `b` are unique.
    - **Non-Unique Elements**: The program should handle cases where elements in `a` and `b` are repeated.
    - **Single Element Subsegments**: When `m=1`, the program should count all elements in `a` that are present in `b`.
    - **All Elements Match**: When all elements in a subsegment of `a` match all elements in `b`, the program should count it.
    - **No Elements Match**: When no elements in a subsegment of `a` match any elements in `b`, the program should not count it.

### Testing the Program

Let's consider the provided example inputs and outputs:

1. **First Test Case**:
    - Input: `7 4 2`, `4 1 2 3 4 5 6`, `1 2 3 4`
    - Output: `4`
    - Explanation: All subsegments are good because they all contain at least 2 matching elements.

2. **Second Test Case**:
    - Input: `7 4 3`, `4 1 2 3 4 5 6`, `1 2 3 4`
    - Output: `3`
    - Explanation: Subsegments starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are good.

3. **Third Test Case**:
    - Input: `7 4 4`, `4 1 2 3 4 5 6`, `1 2 3 4`
    - Output: `2`
    - Explanation: Subsegments starting at positions 1 and 2 are good.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
    - Input: `11 5 3`, `9 9 2 2 10 9 7 6 3 6 3`, `6 9 7 8 10`
    - Output: `4`
    - Explanation: Subsegments starting at positions 1, 3, 4, and 7 are good.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
    - Input: `4 1 1`, `4 1 5 6`, `6`
    - Output: `1`
    - Explanation: Only the subsegment starting at position 4 is good.

The program correctly handles these test cases. Given the sliding window mechanism and the use of counters, the program should handle all edge cases efficiently.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program efficiently uses a sliding window approach with counters to determine the number of good subsegments. It correctly handles all edge cases, including minimum and maximum values of `k`, unique and non-unique elements, and various subsegment lengths.
