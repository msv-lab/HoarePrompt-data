Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= k <= m <= n`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers. List `a` contains `n` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000, and list `b` contains `m` integers each between 1 and 1,000,000. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000, and the sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a value based on the relationship between these inputs for each test case.**
