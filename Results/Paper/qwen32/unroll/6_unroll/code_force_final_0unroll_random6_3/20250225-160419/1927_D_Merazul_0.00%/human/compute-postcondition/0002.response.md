The `while` loop in the given program is `while t:`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value. The variable `t` is described as an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Given this range, `t` will initially be a positive integer, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, the state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component into an integer.**
