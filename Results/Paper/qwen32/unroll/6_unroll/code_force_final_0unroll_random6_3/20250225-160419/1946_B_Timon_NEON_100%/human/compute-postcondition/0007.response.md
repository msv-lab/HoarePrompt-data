The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. The new segment is created by concatenating `new_segment` with `[len(arr) - 1]`. Given that `new_segment` is `[5, 6]`, the new segment that will be appended is `[5, 6, len(arr) - 1]`.

After the execution, `segments_variants` will include this new segment, making it `[[3, 1], [9, 4], [12, 6, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [12, 6]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [9, 4], [12, 6, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1.**
