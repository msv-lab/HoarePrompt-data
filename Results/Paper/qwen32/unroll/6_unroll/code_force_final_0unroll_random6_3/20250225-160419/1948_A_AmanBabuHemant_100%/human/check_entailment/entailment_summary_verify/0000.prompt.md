You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each test case, it determines if `n` is even and less than or equal to 100. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'YES' followed by a string of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is odd or greater than 100, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program incorrectly handles cases where `n` is odd. According to the problem description, a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The example output shows that for `n = 1`, the output should be "YES" followed by a string with exactly one special character, such as "MM". However, the current implementation incorrectly returns "NO" for any odd `n`.

Let's consider the case when `n = 1`:
- The correct output should be:
  ```
  YES
  MM
  ```
- The current program outputs:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The program only generates a valid string for even `n` by repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times. For odd `n`, it should be able to generate a string with exactly one special character, which can be achieved by using a pattern like "MM" for `n = 1` or "AABB" for `n = 3`.

To fix the program, we need to handle the case when `n` is odd. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('MM')
        elif n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version handles the case when `n = 1` and provides the correct output.
