Let's analyze the given program in the context of the problem description.

The task is to create a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in this context.
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring "AAB" `n // 2` times. This string is guaranteed to have exactly `n` special characters.
5. It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200, but this check is unnecessary because the maximum length of `s` will be `3 * 25 = 75` (when `n = 50`), which is well within the limit.
6. If the length condition is satisfied (which it always will be in this case), it prints "YES" and the constructed string.

The program handles the case where `n` is odd correctly by printing "NO". For even `n`, it constructs a valid string with exactly `n` special characters and prints it.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
