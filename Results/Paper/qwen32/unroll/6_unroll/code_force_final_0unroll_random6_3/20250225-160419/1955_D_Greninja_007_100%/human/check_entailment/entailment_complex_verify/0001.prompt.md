You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

It then slides a window of size `m` across the rest of list `a`, updating the count similarly for each new window.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of good subsegments of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching `b` when rearranged.
   
3. **Counter Initialization:**
   - `cb = Counter(sorted(b))`: This creates a counter for the elements in `b`. However, sorting `b` is unnecessary here because the counter will work correctly without sorting.
   - `ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`: This creates a counter for the first subsegment of `a` of length `m`. Sorting `a[:m]` is also unnecessary.

4. **Initial Check:**
   - `sm = sum((ca & cb).values())`: This calculates the number of common elements between the first subsegment of `a` and `b`. The `&` operator on counters returns a new counter with the minimum counts of each element in both counters.
   - If `sm >= k`, it increments the `ans` by 1, indicating that the first subsegment is good.

5. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window and each element `a[r - m]` removed from the window, it updates the counter `ca` and the sum `sm` accordingly.
   - It checks if the new sum `sm` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `ans` if true.

6. **Output:**
   - The function returns the count of good subsegments, which is printed for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections

- **Sorting Unnecessary:** Sorting `b` and `a[:m]` is unnecessary. The `Counter` will work correctly without sorting.
- **Correctness of Logic:** The logic of using a sliding window to update the count of common elements is correct. The program correctly updates the count of elements entering and leaving the window and checks if the condition `sm >= k` holds.

### Conclusion

The program is correct in terms of logic and handles the sliding window approach efficiently. The unnecessary sorting does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **True**
