In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` which iterates over the range of `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute once for each test case, and the number of iterations is determined by the value of `t` (the number of test cases).

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we need to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range function, which depends on the input value `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized or adjusted manually.
3. The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the input value `t` is such that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Given the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4, this condition is already satisfied by the problem statement.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
