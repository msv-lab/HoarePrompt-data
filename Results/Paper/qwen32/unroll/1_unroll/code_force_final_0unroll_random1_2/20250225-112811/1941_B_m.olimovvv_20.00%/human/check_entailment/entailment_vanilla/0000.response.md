Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`) and modify the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Consideration**: The operation always modifies the elements in such a way that the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the elements in the array remains unchanged. This is because the total change in the sum due to the operation is `-1 - 2 - 1 = -4`, which is an even number.
2. **Initial Sum Parity**: If the initial sum of the array is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero because the final sum (which is zero) is even. Therefore, if the sum of the array is odd, the answer should be "NO".
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros. The correct approach should involve checking the parity of the entire array sum.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors. However, this is not a comprehensive check for the entire array. The program does not calculate the sum of the array to check its parity, which is a crucial step in solving the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the sum of the array.
2. Check if the sum is even. If it is not, print "NO".
3. If the sum is even, further checks might be needed to ensure that the array can be reduced to zeros using the given operation, but the problem can be simplified by checking the parity of the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as it only checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors, which is insufficient. The correct approach involves checking the parity of the entire array sum.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
