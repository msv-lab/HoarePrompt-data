Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks a list of integers and prints 'YES' if the first element is even or the second element is exactly two more than the first element when the first is odd, and the last element is even or the second-to-last element is exactly two less than the last element when the last is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
