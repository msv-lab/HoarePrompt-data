To understand the output state, let's break down the provided code and analyze what it does:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - `l` is the length of the list `array`.
   - `array` is a list of integers.
   - `alp` is a list of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
   - `ans` is an empty list that will store the final result.
   - The inner loop iterates over each element in `rev_array`. For each element at index `j`, it counts how many times this element appears in the sublist starting from index `j` to the end of `rev_array`, and then subtracts 1 from this count. The result is used as an index to pick a letter from `alp`, which is then appended to `ans`.
   - Finally, the list `ans` is joined into a string and printed.

The output for each test case is a string where each character is determined by the count of the corresponding element in the reversed list minus one, used as an index into the alphabet list.

Given the format and the task, the output state will consist of `t` strings, each corresponding to the result of the processing of each test case.

Output State: **For each of the t test cases, a string is produced where each character corresponds to the count of the corresponding element in the reversed list minus one, used as an index into the alphabet list.**
