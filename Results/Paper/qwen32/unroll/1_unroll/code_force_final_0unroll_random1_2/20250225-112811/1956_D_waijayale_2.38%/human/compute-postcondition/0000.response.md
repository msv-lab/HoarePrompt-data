Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 0 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each i in the range of the length of a; `n` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the list `a` retains its initial properties, and a new variable `n` is introduced, which holds the value of an integer input.
