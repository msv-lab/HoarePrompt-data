To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `ops`, which is a list of tuples. Therefore, the state of `ops` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head objects**: The loop head contains `(l, r) in ops`. This means the loop will iterate over each tuple in the `ops` list.
2. **Determine the requirement for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `ops` is not empty. The other variables `a`, `n`, `s`, and `m` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself but are part of the initial state provided.

### Adjusted State:
The state must ensure that `ops` contains at least one tuple. We don't need to specify the exact contents of `ops` beyond this requirement, as the loop body is omitted and we are only concerned with the loop's ability to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple**
