Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`**.

In this output state, the variables `a` and `n` remain unchanged as per the initial state. The new variables `s`, `m`, and `ops` are introduced and assigned the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.
