Functionality: **The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies the list `a` by setting elements within the range from index `l` to `r` to a specific value if a certain condition is met, and recursively processes subarrays otherwise. It also appends operations to the list `ops`. The final state of the program is that the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` may be modified, and `ops` contains tuples representing the ranges that have been processed.**
