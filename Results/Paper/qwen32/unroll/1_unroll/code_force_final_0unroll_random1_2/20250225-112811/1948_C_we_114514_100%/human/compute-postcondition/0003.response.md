The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `results` do not directly affect whether the loop can start executing, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list**
