The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases to be processed. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `f`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `m` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `m_i` <= 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i + 1}`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
