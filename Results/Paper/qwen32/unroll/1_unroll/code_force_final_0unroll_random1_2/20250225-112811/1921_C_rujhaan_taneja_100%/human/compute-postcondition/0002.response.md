To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the logic of the code:

1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over the number of test cases (`test_cases`).
2. **Inner Logic**:
    - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
    - It reads a list of integers `arr` of size `n`.
    - It initializes an empty list `array2`.
    - It iterates over the list `arr` to determine if the difference between consecutive elements is less than `b / a`:
        - If `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, it appends `arr[0] * a` to `array2`.
        - If `i > 0` and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.
    - It calculates the sum of `array2` and adds `(n - len(array2)) * b`.
    - It checks if this sum is less than `f` and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'.

Given that the loop iterates over `test_cases` and performs the above operations for each test case, the output state will consist of `test_cases` number of 'Yes' or 'No' outputs based on the conditions met for each test case.

Since the code does not modify the initial variables `test_cases`, `t`, or the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m` in a way that affects their state outside the loop, these remain unchanged.

**Output State**: **Consists of `test_cases` number of lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions met for each test case.**
