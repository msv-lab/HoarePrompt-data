The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes certain conditions and operations that are performed on a list, but these do not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the state of the list or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes some operations on a list, setting elements at positions i-1 to 0 under certain conditions and potentially reducing adjacent elements. It also mentions that `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True.
2. The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the list's state or the result of `func_1(list, n)`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
