### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step to ensure accuracy.

#### Problem Requirements:
The task is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using the specified operation:
- Choose an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
- Apply the operation:
  - `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
  - `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
  - `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`

#### Provided Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: Checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: Attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function iterates through the list from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
- For each index `i` in this range, it checks if `a[i] > 1` and both `a[i-1]` and `a[i+1]` are greater than `0`.
- If these conditions are met, it tries to apply the operation. However, the logic is incorrect:
  ```python
  list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
  list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
  list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
  ```
  This logic will incorrectly subtract `list[i-1]` times itself from `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]`. The correct logic should be:
  ```python
  list[i - 1] -= 1
  list[i] -= 2
  list[i + 1] -= 1
  ```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call to `func_1`, the list is a list of integers, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(list)`.
- Inside `func_1`, the loop checks each element of the list to see if it is zero.
- Before the function call to `func_2`, the list is a list of non-negative integers, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`.
- Inside `func_2`, the loop iterates through the list, and the while loop attempts to apply the operation incorrectly.

#### Correctness:
Given the mistake in the logic of `func_2`, the program will not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the mistake in the logic of `func_2`. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to this mistake.

Final: **False**
