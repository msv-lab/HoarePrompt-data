Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem.

The main goal is to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and modify the elements at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` as follows:
- `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`

The provided solution consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`:

1. **Function `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros.
   - If any element in the first `n` elements is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function iterates over the list from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it repeatedly applies the operation as long as `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - The operation is applied by reducing `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` as described.
   - After modifying the list, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of `func_2`. The operation is applied incorrectly in the loop:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```
This code is supposed to subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`. Instead, it subtracts `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`, `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`. This is clearly not the intended behavior.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

Given the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
