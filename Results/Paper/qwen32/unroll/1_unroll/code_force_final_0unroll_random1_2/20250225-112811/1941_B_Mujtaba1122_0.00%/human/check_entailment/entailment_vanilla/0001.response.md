Let's break down the provided code and reason through its correctness in the context of the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements:
The task is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and then changing the values of `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` according to the rules:
- `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`

### Provided Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function iterates through the list from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
- For each index `i` in this range, it checks if `a[i] > 1` and both `a[i-1]` and `a[i+1]` are greater than `0`.
- If these conditions are met, it tries to apply the operation. However, there is a mistake in the logic:
  ```python
  list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
  list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
  list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
  ```
  This logic will incorrectly subtract `list[i-1]` times itself from `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]`. The correct logic should be:
  ```python
  list[i - 1] -= 1
  list[i] -= 2
  list[i + 1] -= 1
  ```

### Additional Considerations:
- The function then calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero after attempting the operations. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
Given the mistake in the logic of `func_2`, the program will not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
