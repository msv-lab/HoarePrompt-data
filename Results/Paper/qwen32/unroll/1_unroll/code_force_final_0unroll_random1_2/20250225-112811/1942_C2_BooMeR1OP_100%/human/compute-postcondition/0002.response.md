Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the final value of `ans` after processing each test case. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `a` are modified during each iteration of the outer loop but revert to their initial state for the next test case. The variables `ans`, `st`, `odd`, and `even` are recalculated for each test case and do not persist between iterations.**
