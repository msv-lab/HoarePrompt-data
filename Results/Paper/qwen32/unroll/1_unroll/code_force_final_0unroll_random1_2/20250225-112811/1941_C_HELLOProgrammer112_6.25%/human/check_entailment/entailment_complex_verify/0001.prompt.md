You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output will be the sum of the occurrences of the substring 'map' and the substring 'pie' in the string s. The variable t will remain unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then calculates and prints the total number of times the substrings 'map' and 'pie' appear in the string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program is incorrect because it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and outputs their sum. This approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions needed to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" is a substring of the resulting string. Counting the occurrences of these substrings does not account for the fact that removing one character could prevent multiple instances of these substrings.

For example, consider the string "mappppie". The program would output 3 (1 for "map" and 2 for "pie"), but the correct answer is 2, as removing the 4th and 9th characters (the 'p's) would make the string beautiful by removing both "map" and "pie".

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated algorithm would be needed to determine the minimum deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
