Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect because it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string and outputs their sum. However, the problem requires us to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful, not just the number of times these substrings appear. The program does not consider the possibility of overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid creating new "map" or "pie" substrings after deletions. 

For example, in the first test case with the string "mmapnapie", the program outputs 2 because "map" appears twice and "pie" appears once, but the correct answer is 2 as well, but this is a coincidence and not because the program correctly calculates the minimum deletions required. The program does not actually remove any characters or consider the effect of removing characters on the formation of new substrings.

Correctness: **False**
