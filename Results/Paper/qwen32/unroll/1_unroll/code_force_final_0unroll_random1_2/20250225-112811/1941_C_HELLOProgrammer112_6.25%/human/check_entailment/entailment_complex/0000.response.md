### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each test case's string `s` and outputs the sum of these counts. According to the problem statement, the task is to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string "beautiful," which means removing all occurrences of "map" and "pie."

The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements because:
- For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
- It counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" using the `count` method.
- It outputs the sum of these counts, which represents the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

The example provided in the problem statement also supports this logic:
- For the string "mmapnapie", the program correctly counts 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in an output of 2.
- For the string "azabazapi", there are no occurrences of "map" or "pie", so the output is 0.
- For the string "mappppie", there is 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in an output of 2.
- For the string "mapmapmapmapmapmap", there are 6 occurrences of "map" and 0 occurrences of "pie", resulting in an output of 6.
- For the string "p", there are no occurrences of "map" or "pie", so the output is 0.
- For the string "pppiepieeee", there is 1 occurrence of "pie" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in an output of 2.

Therefore, the program's logic is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
