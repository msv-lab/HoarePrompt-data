You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (where `m` is less than or equal to `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to reach a specific position by either swapping or passing through positions, based on the costs provided in lists `a` and `b`. The function prints the best cost for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. Specifically, the logic for calculating the total cost and determining the best position to swap with does not follow the problem's requirements accurately.

Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The code incorrectly adds costs based on the conditions provided. It does not properly account for the cost of bribing all people between `j` and `i` when swapping positions. The code only adds `a_j` or `b_k` based on a comparison, but it should consider the cumulative cost of bribing all people in between.

2. **Incorrect Best Calculation**: The `best` variable is supposed to keep track of the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people. However, the way it is updated does not correctly reflect the minimum cost for all possible swaps.

3. **Logic for Swapping**: The logic for determining when to swap and when to add costs is flawed. The code does not correctly simulate the process of bribing people to move up in the queue.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2
7 3 6 9 1
4 3 8 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Kirill starts at position 6 (behind the 5 people in the queue).
- To move to position 2, he can bribe the person at position 5 for 1 coin and then the person at position 4 for 5 coins, totaling 6 coins.
- Alternatively, he can bribe the person at position 2 directly for 3 coins, which is cheaper.

However, the provided code may not correctly compute this minimal cost due to its flawed logic.

Thus, the code is incorrect for this and other potential cases.
