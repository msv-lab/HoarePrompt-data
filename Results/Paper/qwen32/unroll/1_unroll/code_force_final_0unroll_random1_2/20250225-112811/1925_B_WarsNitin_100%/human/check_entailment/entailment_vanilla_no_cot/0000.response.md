Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x` and the GCD of the difficulties is maximized.

The provided program attempts to find the maximum possible GCD for the sub-problems by iterating through potential GCD values (from 1 up to the square root of `x`). For each GCD candidate `i`, it checks if it's possible to partition `x` into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. For each test case, the program reads `x` and `n`.
2. It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
3. It iterates over all potential GCD candidates `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`.
4. For each candidate `i`:
   - It checks if `x` can be partitioned into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `i`. This is done by checking if `(x - n * i) % i == 0` and `x - n * i >= 0`. If true, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - It also checks the same conditions for `x // i` (the complementary divisor of `i`), updating `ans` similarly.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found.

The logic in the program is correct. It efficiently finds the maximum possible GCD by leveraging the properties of divisors and the constraints of the problem.

Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
