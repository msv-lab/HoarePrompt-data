You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the given examples.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems.
- The sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems should be equal to `x`.
- The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis
The provided program iterates through possible divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems such that their sum is `x`. If a valid divisor is found, it updates the maximum GCD found.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Correctness of GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the GCD by checking divisors of `x` and ensuring that the sum of `n` sub-problems with that divisor can sum up to `x`.
2. **Edge Cases**: Verify if the program handles edge cases such as when `x` is equal to `n`, when `x` is a prime number, and when `n` is 1.
3. **Efficiency**: The program uses the square root method to find divisors, which should be efficient given the constraints.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input**: `10 3`
   - **Expected Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: One possible way is to break 10 into 4, 2, and 4. The GCD of 4, 2, and 4 is 2.
   
2. **Input**: `5 5`
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The only way is to break 5 into 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1. The GCD of these is 1.
   
3. **Input**: `420 69`
   - **Expected Output**: `6`
   - **Explanation**: One possible way is to break 420 into 69 sub-problems with difficulties that sum to 420 and have a GCD of 6.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input**: `1 1`
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The only way is to break 1 into 1. The GCD is 1.
   
2. **Input**: `2 2`
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The only way is to break 2 into 1 and 1. The GCD is 1.
   
3. **Input**: `100 1`
   - **Expected Output**: `100`
   - **Explanation**: The only way is to break 100 into 100. The GCD is 100.

### Testing the Program with Code
Let's run the program with these inputs and verify the outputs.

```python
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

# Testing with the provided examples and additional edge cases
test_cases = [
    ("3\n10 3\n5 5\n420 69", "2\n1\n6"),
    ("1 1", "1"),
    ("2 2", "1"),
    ("100 1", "100")
]

def test_func(test_cases):
    for input_data, expected_output in test_cases:
        from io import StringIO
        import sys
        sys.stdin = StringIO(input_data)
        sys.stdout = StringIO()
        func()
        output = sys.stdout.getvalue().strip()
        assert output == expected_output, f"Test failed for input {input_data}. Expected {expected_output}, got {output}"
        print(f"Test passed for input {input_data}. Output: {output}")

test_func(test_cases)
```
