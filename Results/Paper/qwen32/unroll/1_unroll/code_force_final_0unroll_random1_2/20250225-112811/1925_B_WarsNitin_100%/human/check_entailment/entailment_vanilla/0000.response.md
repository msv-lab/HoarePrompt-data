### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem requirements.

1. **Objective**: The goal is to break the problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems with integer difficulties such that their sum equals `x` and the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these difficulties is maximized.

2. **Approach**:
   - The program iterates over potential divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`
     - `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`
   - If either condition is met, it updates the maximum balance `ans` with the current divisor `i` or its corresponding quotient `x // i`.

3. **Validation**:
   - The first condition `x - n * i >= 0` ensures that we can distribute `i` as the difficulty of `n` sub-problems and still have a non-negative remainder.
   - The second condition `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensures that the remainder can be distributed evenly among the sub-problems.
   - The second pair of conditions performs a similar check but with the quotient `x // i` instead of `i`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - **First Test Case**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
     - Possible divisors: `1, 2`
     - For `i = 1`: `10 - 3*1 = 7` (not divisible by 1)
     - For `i = 2`: `10 - 3*2 = 4` (divisible by 2), so `ans = 2`
     - For `i = 5`: `10 - 3*5 = -5` (invalid)
     - For `i = 10`: `10 - 3*10 = -20` (invalid)
     - The maximum balance is `2`.
   - **Second Test Case**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
     - Possible divisors: `1`
     - For `i = 1`: `5 - 5*1 = 0` (divisible by 1), so `ans = 1`
     - The maximum balance is `1`.
   - **Third Test Case**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
     - Possible divisors: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, ...`
