### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum balance, defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems, where the sum of the difficulties equals `x` and there are `n` sub-problems.

The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
1. It checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. If so, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `i`.
2. It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i` in a similar manner. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `x // i`.

The key insight is that the balance (GCD) must be a divisor of `x`. By iterating through all divisors of `x`, the program ensures that it finds the maximum possible balance.

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Possible divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - Checking `i = 1`: `x - n * i = 10 - 3 * 1 = 7` (not divisible by 1)
   - Checking `i = 2`: `x - n * i = 10 - 3 * 2 = 4` (divisible by 2), so `ans = 2`
   - Checking `i = 5`: `x - n * i = 10 - 3 * 5 = -5` (negative, not valid)
   - Checking `i = 10`: `x - n * i = 10 - 3 * 10 = -20` (negative, not valid)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Possible divisors of 5: 1, 5
   - Checking `i = 1`: `x - n * i = 5 - 5 * 1 = 0` (divisible by 1), so `ans = 1`
   - Checking `i = 5`: `x - n * i = 5 - 5 * 5 = -20` (negative, not valid)
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Possible divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
   - Checking `i = 6`: `x - n * i = 420 - 69 * 6 = 6` (divisible by 6), so `ans = 6`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
