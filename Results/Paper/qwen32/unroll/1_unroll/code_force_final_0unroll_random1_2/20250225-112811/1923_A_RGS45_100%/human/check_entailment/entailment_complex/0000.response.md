### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on the following steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string representing the state of the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last '1':**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the last '1' in the original string. The index `y` in the original string is `n - 1 - y`.

3. **Counting '0's Between the First and Last '1':**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first '1' to the last '1'.
   - `z.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in this substring, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips together without any gaps.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
   - `y = 3` (last '1' at index 5, since `n - 1 - 3 = 5`)
   - `z = '111011'`
   - `z.count('0') = 1`
   - Output: `1`

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
   - `y = 0` (last '1' at index 1, since `n - 1 - 0 = 5` but the last '1' is at index 1)
   - `z = '1'`
   - `z.count('0') = 0`
   - Output: `0`

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - `x = 0` (first '1' at index 0)
   - `y = 0` (last '1' at index 5, since `n - 1 - 0 = 5`)
   - `z = '111111'`
   - `z.count('0') = 0`
   - Output: `0`

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - `x = 0` (first '1' at index 0)
   - `y = 2` (last '1' at index 3, since `n - 1 - 2 = 3`)
   - `z = '10101'`
   - `z.count('0') = 2`
   - Output: `2`

5. **Fifth Example:**
   - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
   - `y = 4` (last '1' at index 4, since `n - 1 - 4 = 4`)
   - `z = '1100011'`
   - `z.count('0') = 3`
   - Output: `3`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block without any gaps between them for all the given examples. Hence, the program is correct.
