The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means the value of `t` will change from its initial state to the input value provided by the user. The precondition for the test cases, which involves `n` and `k`, remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^9.**
