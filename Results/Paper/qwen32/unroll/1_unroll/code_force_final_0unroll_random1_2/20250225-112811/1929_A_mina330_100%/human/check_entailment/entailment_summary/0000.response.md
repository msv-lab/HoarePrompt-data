Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. To maximize this sum, we need to arrange the elements in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

One optimal strategy is to sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, the provided program does not compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty as defined in the problem.

For example, consider the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. The optimal rearrangement to maximize beauty is [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], which gives a beauty of (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57. However, the provided program would output 100 - 43 = 57, which is correct for this specific example but not a general solution.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not sum up all the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. It only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
