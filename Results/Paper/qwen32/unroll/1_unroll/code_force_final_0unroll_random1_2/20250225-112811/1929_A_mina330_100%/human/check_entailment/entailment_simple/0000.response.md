### Reasoning:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible.

The provided program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest elements. For example, if the sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the optimal arrangement would be [1, 5, 2, 4, 3] or [5, 1, 4, 2, 3], which would yield a larger sum of differences.

The current program only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.
