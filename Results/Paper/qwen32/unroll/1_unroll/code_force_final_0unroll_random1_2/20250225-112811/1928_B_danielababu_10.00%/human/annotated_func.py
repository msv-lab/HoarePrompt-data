#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function does not take any input parameters.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` prompts the user for input, converts the input to an integer, and returns this integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No specific precondition is provided for the function `func_2` in the context of the problem description. The function `func_2` is defined to return a map object which is the result of applying the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. It is assumed that the input to this function is a string of space-separated integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integer values of the space-separated integers provided in the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a string of space-separated integers from the input, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integer values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any input parameters and returns a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4`. Therefore, no precondition can be described based on the given function signature.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers derived from the input string, where the input string is expected to contain space-separated numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes no input parameters. It reads a space-separated string of numbers from the user, converts these numbers into integers, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_5()`. The function does not take any parameters and does not directly relate to the variables described in the problem. It appears to be a placeholder or utility function that reads input and returns a map object of strings.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on whitespace, and returns a map object containing these parts as strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of characters from the input string provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No explicit parameters; the function reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated string of values. The input is split into a list of strings, which are then sorted lexicographically.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings that are the lexicographically sorted version of the input space-separated string values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, sorts these strings lexicographically, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list of cumulative products of `arr`; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list of cumulative products of `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements from the start of the input list up to the current position.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list of cumulative products of `arr` in reverse order; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans` which is a list of cumulative products of `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing the cumulative products of the elements in reverse order.
