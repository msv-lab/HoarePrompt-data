You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

    #State: `grid` is a list of `n` lists, each of length `m`, representing the field; `elements` is a dictionary with non-'..' elements as keys and their positions as values; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with player identifiers as keys and `False` as values; `goal` is a list of two lists containing positions of 'BG' and 'RG' respectively; `points` is [0, 0].

    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the scores of the first and second players/teams respectively)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, representing the dimensions of a field where both `n` and `m` are odd integers between 3 and 99 inclusive. The function returns an unspecified value or performs an unspecified action based on these dimensions.
