Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (-1, -1); `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `goal` is a list containing two empty lists; `points` is [0, 0].**

In this output state, the variables `n` and `m` retain their initial properties as odd integers within the specified range. The `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` variables remain unchanged. The new variable `points` is introduced and initialized to the list `[0, 0]`.
