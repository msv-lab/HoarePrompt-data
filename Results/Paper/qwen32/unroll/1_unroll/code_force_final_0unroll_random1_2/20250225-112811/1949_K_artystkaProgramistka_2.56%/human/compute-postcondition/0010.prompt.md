You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, na, nb, nc are positive integers such that 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2, and na + nb + nc = n. numbers is a list of n positive integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 10^9.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: `group_a` contains the `na` largest numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` largest numbers, `group_c` contains the remaining `nc` numbers, `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', group_a which contains the na largest numbers from numbers, group_b which contains the next nb largest numbers, and group_c which contains the remaining nc numbers.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n` (a positive integer between 3 and 200,000), `na` (a positive integer between 1 and `n-2`), `nb` (a positive integer between 1 and `n-2`), `nc` (a positive integer between 1 and `n-2`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9). The sum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` equals `n`. The function returns 'YES' along with three groups: `group_a` containing the `na` largest numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` containing the next `nb` largest numbers, and `group_c` containing the remaining `nc` numbers. If it is not possible to form such groups, the function returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', group_a which contains the na largest numbers from numbers, group_b which contains the next nb largest numbers, and group_c which contains the remaining nc numbers.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
