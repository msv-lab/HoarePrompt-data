Postcondition: **`group_a` contains the `na` largest numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` largest numbers, `group_c` contains the remaining `nc` numbers, `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`. The condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true.**
