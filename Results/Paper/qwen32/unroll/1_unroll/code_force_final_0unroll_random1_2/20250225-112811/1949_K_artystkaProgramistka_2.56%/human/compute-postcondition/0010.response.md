Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), three positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (each between 1 and n-2, and their sum equals `n`), and a list of `n` positive integers `numbers` (each between 1 and 10^9). It sorts the list `numbers` in descending order and attempts to distribute the numbers into three groups: `group_a` containing the `na` largest numbers, `group_b` containing the next `nb` largest numbers, and `group_c` containing the remaining `nc` numbers. It then checks if a condition (determined by `func_1`) is met with the sums of these groups. If the condition is met, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups. If not, it returns 'NO'.**
