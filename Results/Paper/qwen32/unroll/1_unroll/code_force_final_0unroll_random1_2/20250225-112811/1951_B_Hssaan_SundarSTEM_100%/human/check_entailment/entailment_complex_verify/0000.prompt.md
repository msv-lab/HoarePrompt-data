You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it computes and prints the maximum number of elements that can be moved to the beginning of the list while maintaining a non-decreasing order, considering two specific scenarios involving the element at index `k-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by considering two main scenarios:
1. Swapping the cow at position `k` with the cow at position `1` (the first cow).
2. Swapping the cow at position `k` with the cow that the cow at position `1` would have defeated in the first match.

However, the program does not fully account for all possible optimal swaps that could maximize the number of wins for cow `k`. Let's go through the logic and identify potential issues:

1. **Initial Swap with Position 1:**
   - The program swaps the cow at position `k` with the cow at position `1` and then counts the number of matches cow `k` can win starting from position `1`.
   - This part of the logic seems correct, as it considers the scenario where cow `k` is placed at the start.

2. **Swap with the Defeated Cow in the First Match:**
   - The program swaps cow `k` with the cow that the cow at position `1` would have defeated in the first match.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it only considers the cow defeated in the first match. There could be other cows that cow `k` could be swapped with to maximize wins.
   - The program does not iterate through all possible positions to find the optimal swap that maximizes the number of wins for cow `k`.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following test case:

```
3
6 3
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1
```

The program's output for this input is:

```
1
2
0
```

Let's analyze the second test case in detail:

```
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
```

- Cow `k` (cow at position 5) has a rating of `12`.
- The program first swaps cow `k` with cow at position `1` (rating `7`), and counts the wins. Cow `k` wins 2 matches.
- Then, the program swaps cow `k` with the cow defeated in the first match (cow at position `2` with rating `2`), and counts the wins. Cow `k` wins 2 matches again.

However, the optimal strategy is to swap cow `k` with cow at position `4` (rating `10`). This would result in the following sequence:

- Initially, `a' = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]`.
- Cow with rating `7` plays against cow with rating `2` and wins. `a' = [7, 727, 10, 12, 13]`.
- Cow with rating `7` plays against cow with rating `727` and loses. Cow `k` (rating `12`) plays against cow with rating `10` and wins. `a' = [12, 727, 13]`.
- Cow `k` plays against cow with rating `727` and loses.

In total, cow `k` wins 2 matches, which is correct. However, the program does not consider all possible swaps, and there might be cases where the optimal swap is not the one considered by the program.

### Conclusion:

The program does not guarantee that it will always find the optimal swap to maximize the number of wins for cow `k` in all possible cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
