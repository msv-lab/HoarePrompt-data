Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it computes and prints the maximum number of elements that can be moved to the beginning of the list while maintaining a non-decreasing order, considering two specific scenarios involving the element at index `k-1`.**
