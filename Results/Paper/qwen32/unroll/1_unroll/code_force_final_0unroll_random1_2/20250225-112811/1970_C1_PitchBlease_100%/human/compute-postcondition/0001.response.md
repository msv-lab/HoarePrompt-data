Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with keys as node integers and values as lists of neighboring node integers, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `((start, 0))`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The `visited` set now includes the `start` node, while all other variables remain unchanged.
