Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed (1 ≤ start ≤ n), `tree` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one adjacent node; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`, and `dist2` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. At least one of `dist1` or `dist2` is odd.**
