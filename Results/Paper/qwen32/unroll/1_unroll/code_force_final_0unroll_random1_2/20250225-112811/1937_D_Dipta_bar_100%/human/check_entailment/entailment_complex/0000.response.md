### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of determining how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position in the grid. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Processing the Grid**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called with the string `s` as an argument.
   - Inside `func_1`, two main calculations are performed:
     - **Left-to-Right Calculation (`A` and `idx_A`)**:
       - The program iterates through the string from left to right.
       - For each `'>` character, it calculates a cumulative value based on its position and the positions of previously encountered `'>` characters.
       - This cumulative value is stored in the list `A`, and the index of the `'>` character is stored in `idx_A`.
     - **Right-to-Left Calculation (`B` and `idx_B`)**:
       - The program iterates through the string from right to left.
       - For each `'<'` character, it calculates a cumulative value based on its position and the positions of previously encountered `'<'` characters.
       - This cumulative value is stored in the list `B`, and the index of the `'<'` character is stored in `idx_B`.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The program initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the current positions in `A` and `B`.
   - For each position `i` in the grid:
     - If the character at position `i` is `'>`:
       - Depending on the values of `l` and `r`, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from position `i` using the cumulative values in `A` and `B`.
     - If the character at position `i` is `'<'`:
       - It updates the pointers `l` and `r` and performs a similar calculation as above.
   - The result for each position `i` is printed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of seconds for each starting position in the grid.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball according to the rules described in the problem.
- It uses cumulative calculations to efficiently determine the number of seconds for each starting position.
- The use of two pointers (`l` and `r`) helps in managing the state of the grid as the pinball moves and the directions are inverted.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the number of seconds for each starting position using cumulative calculations and pointer management.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
