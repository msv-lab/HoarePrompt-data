The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `B`. This action does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the new list `B`.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `A` contains the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters; `idx_A` contains the indices of '>' characters; `B` is an empty list.**
