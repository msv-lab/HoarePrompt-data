### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the given program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Grid Movement Rules:**
   - A pinball on cell `i` with character `s_i`:
     - Moves left if `s_i` is `<`.
     - Moves right if `s_i` is `>`.
   - After each move, `s_i` is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either left or right).

2. **Queries:**
   - For each cell `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n), determine how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid starting from that cell.

#### Code Analysis:
The code reads multiple test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1(s)`.

#### Function `func_1(s)`:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `A` and `B` are lists to store cumulative times for right and left movements.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` store indices of `>` and `<` characters.

2. **Processing Right Movements:**
   - Iterates through the string `s` to find all `>` characters.
   - Calculates cumulative times to reach each `>` from the previous `>` and stores in `A`.
   - Stores indices of `>` in `idx_A`.

3. **Processing Left Movements:**
   - Iterates through the string `s` in reverse to find all `<` characters.
   - Calculates cumulative times to reach each `<` from the previous `<` and stores in `B`.
   - Stores indices of `<` in `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Output:**
   - For each position in the grid:
     - If the character is `>`, it calculates the total time to leave the grid considering both right and left movements.
     - If the character is `<`, it similarly calculates the total time to leave the grid.
   - The results are printed for each starting position.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Cumulative Time Calculation:**
   - The cumulative time calculations for `A` and `B` do not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and inversion.
   - The formulas used to calculate `x` and the cumulative times in `A` and `B` are not aligned with the problem's rules.

2. **Inversion Handling:**
   - The code does not correctly simulate the inversion of characters after each move.
   - The inversion logic is crucial for the correct simulation of the pinball's movement.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The output calculations for each starting position do not match the problem's requirements.
   - The logic for combining the cumulative times from `A` and `B` is flawed and does not accurately represent the pinball's movement and inversion.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the pinball's movement step-by-step for each starting position, taking into account the inversion of characters after each move. This simulation should accurately reflect the pinball's behavior as described in the problem statement.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the cumulative time calculations, inversion handling, and output calculations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The logic and approach used in the code are flawed and do not align with the problem's requirements.

**Final: False**
