Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed and does not match the problem requirements. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the inversion of the grid characters and the movement rules for the pinball.

To solve this problem correctly, a more straightforward and accurate approach would involve simulating the pinball movement for each starting position, taking into account the inversion of characters after each move. The provided solution seems overly complex and does not correctly implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as intended.

Here is a simplified version of the correct approach:

1. For each test case, simulate the pinball movement starting from each cell.
2. Use a queue or a similar structure to keep track of the pinball's position and the number of steps taken.
3. Invert the character at the current position after each move.
4. Stop the simulation when the pinball leaves the grid.
5. Output the number of steps for each starting position.

This approach ensures that the pinball's movement is accurately simulated according to the problem's rules.
