The code snippet calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be the length of the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`**.
