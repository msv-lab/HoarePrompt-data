Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the given criteria. The program only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows with '1's are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape accurately.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
001
011
111
```
The program would output "TRIANGLE" because the number of '1's in the first two rows with '1's (1 and 2, respectively) are not equal. However, this is actually a triangle shape according to the problem description.

Another issue arises with squares. The program would output "SQUARE" for any shape where the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's, which is not necessarily a square.

To correctly determine the shape, the program needs to check the pattern of '1's in the grid more thoroughly, ensuring that the '1's form a square or a triangle according to the given definitions.
