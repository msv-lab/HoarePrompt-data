t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape (either a triangle or a square) made up of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
