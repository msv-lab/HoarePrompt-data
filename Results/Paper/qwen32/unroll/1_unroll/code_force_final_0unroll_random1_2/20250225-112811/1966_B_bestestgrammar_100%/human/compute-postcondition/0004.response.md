Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each grid, it determines if it's possible to change the color of some cells such that the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, either directly or by ensuring that there is at least one pair of adjacent cells in the top or bottom row with different colors, or at least one pair of adjacent cells in the first or last column with different colors. The function outputs 'YES' if such a configuration is possible and 'NO' otherwise.**
