Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Summary
We are given a grid of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) squares. In one operation, we can select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color. The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.

### Key Observations
1. **Single Color Grid**: If the grid already has all squares of the same color, the answer is "YES".
2. **Corner Colors**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are of the same color, then it is always possible to make the entire grid that color. This is because we can always find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right by flipping subrectangles of the same color.
3. **Border Consistency**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, we need to ensure that the entire top row and the entire bottom row are consistent (i.e., all squares in these rows are the same color) and the entire left column and the entire right column are consistent. If both the top and bottom rows are consistent and the left and right columns are consistent, then it is possible to flip the entire grid to one color.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself.
2. **Initial Answer**: Initializes the answer to "YES".
3. **Corner Check**: Checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
   - If they are different, it checks if the top row and bottom row are consistent (i.e., all squares in these rows are the same color).
   - It also checks if the left column and right column are consistent (i.e., all squares in these columns are the same color).
   - If either the top/bottom rows or left/right columns are not consistent, it sets the answer to "NO".
4. **Output**: Prints the answer for each test case.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify the logic:
- If the corners are the same, the answer is correctly set to "YES".
- If the corners are different, the program checks the consistency of the top/bottom rows and left/right columns. If any of these are inconsistent, it correctly sets the answer to "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the grid can be made uniform in color based on the given operations.

### Conclusion
The program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
