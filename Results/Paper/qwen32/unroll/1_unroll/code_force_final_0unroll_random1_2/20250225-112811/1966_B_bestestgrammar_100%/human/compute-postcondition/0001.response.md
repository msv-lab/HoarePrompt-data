The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which iterates over the range of `t`. To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `t` is the only thing we can adjust based on the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
