You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and outputs the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to compute the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases.
- The program should handle up to 10,000 test cases where `n` can be as large as 200,000.
- The program must output the sum of the digits for each test case.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `pd` (presumably for "prefix digit sum") with 200,001 zeros (since the maximum `n` is 200,000).

2. **Prefix Digit Sum Calculation:**
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, it adds the sum of its digits to the previous prefix sum stored in `pd[i-1]` and stores the result in `pd[i]`.
   - This effectively creates a prefix sum array where `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, and prints `pd[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digits from 1 to `n`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Initialization and Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum array `pd` is correctly computed. For each number `i`, the sum of its digits is added to the cumulative sum from previous numbers.
  - This method ensures that the sum of the digits for any number `n` can be found in constant time by simply accessing `pd[n]`.

- **Handling Input and Output:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and printing `pd[n]`.
  - This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it precomputes all necessary values up to the maximum possible `n` (200,000) in a single pass, and each test case is handled in constant time.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the sum of the digits for all integers from 1 to `n` for each test case, and it does so efficiently within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
