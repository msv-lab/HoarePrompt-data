Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Prefix Sum Array Initialization**: The prefix sum array `pd` is initialized with a size of `N`, where `N` is `2 * 100000 + 1`. However, the array is being filled incorrectly. The loop that calculates the prefix sum and digit sums is not correctly updating the values in the array. Specifically, the line `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` is executed before adding the digit sums, which means the prefix sum includes the previous prefix sum before the current number's digit sum is added.

2. **Logic for Digit Sum Calculation**: The inner loop that calculates the sum of digits for each number `i` is correct, but the order of operations needs to be adjusted so that the prefix sum includes the correct digit sum for each number.

3. **Space Complexity**: While the space complexity is not an issue given the problem constraints, the program could be optimized to avoid using such a large prefix sum array if it were not necessary.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        digit_sum = sum(int(j) for j in str(i))
        pd[i] = pd[i - 1] + digit_sum
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])

func()
```

In the corrected version, the digit sum for each number `i` is calculated first, and then the prefix sum is updated. This ensures that `pd[i]` contains the correct sum of the digit sums from `1` to `i`.
