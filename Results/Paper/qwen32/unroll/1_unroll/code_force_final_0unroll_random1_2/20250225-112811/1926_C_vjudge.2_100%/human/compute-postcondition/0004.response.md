To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `N` is set to 200001.
   - `pd` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The outer loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 200000` (since `range(1, N)`).
   - For each `i`, `pd[i]` is updated by adding the value of `pd[i - 1]`.
   - Then, for each digit `j` in the string representation of `i`, `pd[i]` is incremented by the integer value of `j`.

Let's understand the effect of the loop:
- `pd[i]` accumulates the sum of all previous `pd` values (`pd[i-1]`).
- Additionally, `pd[i]` accumulates the sum of the digits of `i`.

To compute the final state, we need to observe the pattern:
- `pd[1]` will be `pd[0] + 1` (which is `0 + 1 = 1`).
- `pd[2]` will be `pd[1] + 2` (which is `1 + 2 = 3`).
- `pd[3]` will be `pd[2] + 3` (which is `3 + 3 = 6`).
- And so on.

However, the precise value of `pd[i]` for each `i` is complex to derive manually without computation. We can infer that `pd[i]` will be the cumulative sum of all previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to `i`.

Given the complexity and the nature of the problem, the final state of `pd` after the loop is best described as the cumulative sum of the previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to 200000.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `N` is 200001; `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of all previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to `i`.**
