### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness systematically.

**Problem Recap:**
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (where `3 <= n <= 78`).
- The letters are indexed from 1 ('a') to 26 ('z').

**Current Program Analysis:**
The provided program constructs the word based on the value of `n` as follows:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If `26 < n <= 52`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- If `n <= 26`, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Let's evaluate the logic of these cases:

1. **Case 1: `n > 52`**
   - The program constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - For example, if `n = 78`, then `n - 53 = 25`, so the character is 'y', and the word becomes 'yzz'.
   - The sum of the indices of 'yzz' is `25 + 26 + 26 = 77`, which is incorrect for `n = 78`.
   - For `n = 78`, the correct word should be 'rzz' because `18 + 26 + 26 = 70 + 8 = 78`.

2. **Case 2: `26 < n <= 52`**
   - The program constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - For example, if `n = 52`, then `n - 28 = 24`, so the character is 'x', and the word becomes 'axz'.
   - The sum of the indices of 'axz' is `1 + 24 + 26 = 51`, which is incorrect for `n = 52`.
   - For `n = 52`, the correct word should be 'czz' because `3 + 26 + 23 = 52`.

3. **Case 3: `n <= 26`**
   - The program constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - For example, if `n = 3`, then `n - 3 = 0`, so the character is 'a', and the word becomes 'aaa'.
   - The sum of the indices of 'aaa' is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is correct for `n = 3`.
   - For `n = 26`, the correct word should be 'azz' because `1 + 26 + 26 - 26 = 26`.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the program does not correctly handle the cases where `n > 52` and `26 < n <= 52`. The program fails to construct the lexicographically smallest word for these ranges.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to systematically find the lexicographically smallest word by iterating through possible combinations of three letters and checking their sums.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **False**
