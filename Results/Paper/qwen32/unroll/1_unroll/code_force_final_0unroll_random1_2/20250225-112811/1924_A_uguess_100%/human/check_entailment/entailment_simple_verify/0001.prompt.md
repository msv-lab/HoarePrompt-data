You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Subsequence Checking**: The program attempts to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. However, the logic for checking subsequences is flawed. The approach in the code does not correctly identify subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Counting Subsequences**: The variable `cnt` is supposed to count how many times a full set of characters (from 0 to `k-1`) appears in the string `s`. However, this does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked. The code increments `cnt` when all characters from 0 to `k-1` are found in sequence, but this does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: When the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it tries to generate a missing subsequence. However, the logic for generating this subsequence is incorrect. It only checks for the first missing character and appends 'a' repeatedly, which does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence of length `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is greater than `k`, it is impossible to form all possible strings of length `n` using only `k` characters. The program does not account for this scenario.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
