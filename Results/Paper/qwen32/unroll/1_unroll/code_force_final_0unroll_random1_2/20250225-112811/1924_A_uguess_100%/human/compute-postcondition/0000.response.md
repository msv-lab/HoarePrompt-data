Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

In natural language: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the input integer, which is between 1 and 100,000 inclusive. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) remain as described in the initial state.
