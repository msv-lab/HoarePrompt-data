### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Class Definition:**
   - `BalanceInfo` class is defined to store the balance, position, and character for each character in the parentheses sequence.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used as a comparator for sorting `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It first compares the `balance` attributes of two `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - If the `balance` values are different, it returns the difference, which helps in sorting by increasing balance.
   - If the `balance` values are the same, it returns the difference in positions but in reverse order (`infoB.position - infoA.position`), which ensures that ties are broken by decreasing position.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function takes the input string `s` and initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates over the string, calculates the balance for each prefix, and appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` for each character.
   - After constructing the list, it sorts it using the `func_1` comparator.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

4. **Sorting and Result Construction:**
   - The sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the specified rules: first by increasing balance and then by decreasing position in case of ties.
   - The result string is constructed by simply joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.

5. **Output:**
   - The output is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence, which matches the expected output as per the example provided.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It constructs the `BalanceInfo` objects, sorts them according to the specified rules, and constructs the result string from the sorted list.

**Correctness: **True**
