### Reasoning:

1. **Class Definition and Initialization**:
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is defined with an initializer that takes `balance`, `position`, and `character` as parameters. This class will be used to store the balance, position, and character for each prefix in the parentheses sequence.

2. **Comparison Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The `func_1` function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, based on their `balance` attribute. If the balances are different, it returns the difference. If the balances are the same, it returns the negative difference of their positions (`infoB.position - infoA.position`). This ensures that in case of ties in balance, the higher position (lower in the sequence) comes first, which aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The `func_2` function takes a string `s` as input. It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects and a variable `balance` to keep track of the current balance.
   - It iterates over the string `s`. For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` with the current balance, position, and character. It then updates the balance: increments it for '(', and decrements it for ')'.
   - After collecting all `BalanceInfo` objects, it sorts them using the `sort` method with a custom key. The key is a tuple where the first element is `balance` and the second element is `-position` (to ensure higher positions come first in case of ties).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the `character` attributes of the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints the result.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the input string.
- The sorting criteria are correctly implemented to ensure that the resulting sequence is a balanced shuffle as described in the problem statement.
- The output matches the problem's requirements: it prints the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
