Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues and does not correctly implement the logic for simulating the pinball movement as described in the problem statement. Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Pinball Movement**: The logic for calculating the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. The program uses complex calculations involving arrays `A` and `B` to keep track of the movements, but these calculations do not accurately simulate the described behavior of the pinball. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the inversion of the characters and the subsequent movement of the pinball.

2. **Inversion of Characters**: The problem states that after the pinball moves, the character at the current cell is inverted. However, the provided program does not update the string `s` to reflect these inversions. This means that the pinball's movement will not be correctly simulated, especially in cases where the pinball revisits the same cell multiple times.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The provided program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the pinball starts at a cell with a '<' character and there are no '>' characters to the left, the pinball should leave the grid immediately. However, the provided program may not handle such cases correctly due to the flawed logic.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results for each test case without properly formatting the output as specified in the problem statement. The problem requires that the results for each test case be printed on a new line, but the provided program prints all results on the same line.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position, taking into account the inversion of characters after each move, and correctly handle all edge cases. The provided program does not meet these requirements, so it is incorrect.
