Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position in the grid. The program uses a sophisticated approach involving two arrays `A` and `B` to keep track of the cumulative movements based on the '<' and '>' characters.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Processing '>' Characters:**
   - The program initializes an array `A` to store cumulative movements and an array `idx_A` to store indices of '>' characters.
   - It iterates over the string `s`. For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous '>' characters and appends it to `A`. It also appends the index of the '>' character to `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters:**
   - Similarly, the program initializes an array `B` to store cumulative movements and an array `idx_B` to store indices of '<' characters.
   - It iterates over the string `s` in reverse order. For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous '<' characters and appends it to `B`. It also appends the index of the '<' character to `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Output for Each Query:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to manage the indices of `A` and `B` respectively.
   - For each position `i` in the string `s`, it determines whether the character is '>' or '<'.
   - Depending on the character, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B`.
   - It prints the result for each position.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where there are no '>' or '<' characters by checking the length of `idx_A` and `idx_B` before accessing their elements.
   - It also handles the case where the pinball leaves the grid from the left or right border by calculating the appropriate number of seconds.

The execution summary suggests that the function `func_1` processes the string and prints the results based on the described logic. Given the complexity and the way the program handles the movements and cumulative counts, it appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

However, the code provided does not actually return or print the results in the format specified in the problem description. The `func_1` function is supposed to print the results, but the main loop in the program does not capture or print the output of `func_1`. This discrepancy suggests that the program might not produce the correct output format as expected.

Given the description and the execution summary, the logic seems correct, but the implementation detail of capturing and printing the output from `func_1` is missing.

Correctness: **False**
