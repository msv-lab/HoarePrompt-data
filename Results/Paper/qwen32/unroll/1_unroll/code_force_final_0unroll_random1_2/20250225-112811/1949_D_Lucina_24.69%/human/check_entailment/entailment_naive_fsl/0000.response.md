Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not guarantee that the number of consecutive videos of the same type will not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\). The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to '?' characters does not take into account the constraint of limiting consecutive videos of the same type.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Consecutive Videos Constraint**: The code does not check if adding an 'F' or 'S' will result in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. It simply assigns 'F' or 'S' based on whether the node is in the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) nodes of `sa` or `sb`, which does not ensure the constraint is met for all permutations.

2. **Greedy Assignment**: The code uses a greedy approach to assign 'F' or 'S' to '?' characters, but this approach does not guarantee that the constraint will be satisfied for all possible permutations of scenarios. The constraint must be checked dynamically as the assignments are made.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:

```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
????.
```

The code might output something like:

```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

However, for the permutation (1, 3, 5, 2, 4), the sequence of transition videos will be `FFFSS`, which has 3 'F's in a row, and this is valid. But if the code assigns 'F' or 'S' without checking the constraint, it might produce a sequence like `FFFFS` or `SSSSF`, which violates the constraint because it has 4 'F's or 4 'S's in a row, and \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\).

### Conclusion:
The code does not ensure that the constraint of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met for all permutations. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
