The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `sa`. None of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `n`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will include the newly created empty list `sa` along with the previously defined variables `a`, `b`, and `xx`.

Output State: **`a` will be a list of `n + 1` integers where the i-th element (for i from 1 to n) is the total number of 'F' characters in the i-th row (or column) of the input matrix; `b` will be a list of `n + 1` integers where the i-th element (for i from 1 to n) is the total number of 'S' characters in the i-th row (or column) of the input matrix; `xx` will be a list containing an empty string followed by all the strings from the input list; `sa` is an empty list.**
