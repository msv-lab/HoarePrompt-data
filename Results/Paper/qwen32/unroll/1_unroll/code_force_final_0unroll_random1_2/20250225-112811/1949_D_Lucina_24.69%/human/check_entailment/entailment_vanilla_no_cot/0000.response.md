Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee that the resulting sequence of transition videos will never have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type in a row for any permutation of the scenarios. The logic used for assigning 'F' and 'S' to the '?' positions does not take into account the requirement to avoid long sequences of the same type.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to '?' positions based on whether the scenario index is in the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor\) scenarios of the list `sa` or `sb`. This approach does not ensure that the constraint on the maximum number of consecutive videos of the same type is met.
2. The program does not consider the constraints for all possible permutations of scenarios, only a limited subset based on the initial assignments of 'F' and 'S'.
3. The logic for choosing between 'F' and 'S' for '?' positions is not robust enough to handle all edge cases and ensure the required constraint is met for every possible scenario permutation.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as backtracking or dynamic programming, to ensure that the constraint on the maximum number of consecutive videos of the same type is met for all permutations of scenarios.
