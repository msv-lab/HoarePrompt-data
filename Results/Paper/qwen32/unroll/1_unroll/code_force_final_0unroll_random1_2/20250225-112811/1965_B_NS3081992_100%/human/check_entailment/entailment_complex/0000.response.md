### Reasoning:

The given Python program is structured to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two integers, `n` and `k`. The problem requires constructing a sequence of integers that meets specific criteria related to the sums of its subsequences.

The core logic is implemented in `func_14()`, which constructs the sequence based on the values of `n` and `k`. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`, which reads an integer from the input. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Binary Representation**: The binary representation of `n` (`b`) and `k` (`bk`) is computed to determine the length of the binary representation.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - If `k` is 1:
     - If `n` is 2, the sequence is `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k` is not 1:
     - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
     - It continues with powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

The program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. The logic ensures that the constructed sequence:
- Does not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
- Has subsequences that sum to all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v â‰  k`.

### Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
