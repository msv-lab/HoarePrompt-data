### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summary. We will focus on the logic in `func_14()` to ensure it satisfies the problem requirements.

#### Problem Analysis Recap

The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

#### Program Analysis Recap

- `func_14()`:
  - Reads `n` and `k`.
  - Converts `n` and `k` to binary.
  - Handles the special case where `k == 1` separately.
  - For other values of `k`, it constructs the sequence `ans`:
    - Adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
    - Adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
    - Adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to `ans`.
    - Adds remaining powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Detailed Verification

Let's analyze the logic in `func_14()` more closely:

1. **Handling `k == 1`**:
   - If `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` ensures no subsequence sums to `1`.
   - Otherwise, the sequence `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 ensures all sums up to `n` except `1` can be formed.
   
   This seems correct because:
   - `[2]` cannot sum to `1`.
   - `[2, 3]` can sum to `2` and `3`.
   - Adding powers of 2 (`4, 8, 16, ...`) allows forming all sums up to `n` except `1`.

2. **Handling `k != 1`**:
   - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by adding a specific value that prevents this.
   - Adding `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensures that sums above `k` can be formed.
   - Remaining powers of 2 ensure all sums up to `n` can be formed.

   This logic seems correct because:
   - Powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` form a basis for sums.
   - `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is carefully chosen to prevent any subsequence from summing to `k`.
   - `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensure that sums above `k` can be formed.
   - Remaining powers of 2 ensure all sums up to `n` can be formed.

#### Verification with Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   5
   2 2
   6 1
   8 8
   9 3
   10 7
   ```

2. **Output:**
   ```
   1
   1
   5
   2 3 4 5 6
   7
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   4
   7 1 4 1
   4
   1 2 8 3
   ```

- **Test Case 1 (n=2, k=2)**:
  - Output: `1\n1`
  - Explanation: `[1]` ensures no subsequence sums to `2` and `1` can be formed.
  
  **Correct**.

- **Test Case 2 (n=6, k=1)**:
  - Output: `5\n2 3 4 5 6`
  - Explanation: No subsequence sums to `1`, and all sums from `2` to `6` can be formed.
  
  **Correct**.

- **Test Case 3 (n=8, k=8)**:
  - Output: `7\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Explanation: No subsequence sums to `8`, and all sums from `1` to `7` can be formed.
  
  **Incorrect**:
  - The sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` can form sums of `1`, `2`, `3`, ..., `7` but also `8` (e.g., `1+1+1+1+1+1+1=7` and `1+1+1+1+1+1+2=8` is not possible, but `1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=8` is possible if we have another `1`).

- **Test Case 4 (n=9, k=3)**:
  - Output: `4\n7 1 4 1`
  - Explanation: No subsequence sums to `3`, and all sums from `1` to `9` except `3` can be formed.
  
  **Correct**.

- **Test Case 5 (n=10, k=7)**:
  - Output: `4\n1 2 8 3`
  - Explanation: No subsequence sums to `7`, and all sums from `1` to `10` except `7` can be formed.
  
  **Correct**.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the logic in `func_14()` for handling `k != 1` seems correct, but there is an issue with the handling of `k == 8` in the third test case. The sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` can form sums up to `7` but also `8` if we consider multiple `1`s. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
