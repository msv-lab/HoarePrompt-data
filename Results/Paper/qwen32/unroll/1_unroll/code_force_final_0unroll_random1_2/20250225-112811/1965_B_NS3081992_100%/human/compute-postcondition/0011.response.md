The code snippet `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` into its binary representation and assigns it to the variable `bk` as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix that Python includes in binary literals.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are integers with specific values determined by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n`, and `l` is the length of `b`. The value of `k` is not 1. The only change in the output state is the introduction of the variable `bk`, which holds the binary representation of `k` as a string.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string, `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, and `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string.**
