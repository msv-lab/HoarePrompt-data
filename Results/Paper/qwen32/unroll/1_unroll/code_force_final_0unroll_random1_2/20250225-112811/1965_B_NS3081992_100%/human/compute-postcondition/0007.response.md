The code snippet provided initializes a list `ans` with the values `[2, 3]`. The initial state of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, and `l`) is not affected by this operation.

Given:
- `n` and `k` are integers with specific values determined by `func_7()`.
- `k` is specifically equal to 1.
- `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string.
- `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
- `n` is not equal to 2.

The only change in the state is the creation and initialization of the list `ans`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and their specific values are determined by the return values of `func_7()`. `k` is equal to 1. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string. `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 2. `ans` is `[2, 3]`.**
