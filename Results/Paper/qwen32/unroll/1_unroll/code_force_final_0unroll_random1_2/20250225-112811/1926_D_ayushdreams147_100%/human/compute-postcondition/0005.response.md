Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers. The function returns the count of unique elements in the list `a` that do not have a bitwise complement (i.e., a number `x` such that `x ^ y = 2^k - 1` for some integer `k`) present in the list.**
