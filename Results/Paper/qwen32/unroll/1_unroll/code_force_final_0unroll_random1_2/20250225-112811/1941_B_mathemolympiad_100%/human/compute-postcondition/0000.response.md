Output State: **`numTest` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= `a_j` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `numTest` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet provided.
