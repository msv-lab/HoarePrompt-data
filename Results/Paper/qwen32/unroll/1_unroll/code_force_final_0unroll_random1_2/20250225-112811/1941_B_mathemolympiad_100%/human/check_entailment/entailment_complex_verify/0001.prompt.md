You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    #State: a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be reduced to zeros by performing specific operations on its elements. It prints 'YES' if the list can be reduced to zeros, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The program is attempting to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`numTest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array from the first element to the third last element (`for i in range(0, n - 2)`).
   - For each element `a[i]` at index `i`, it calculates the number of operations (`opNum`) that can be performed using the value of `a[i]`.
   - It then updates the array elements as follows:
     - `a[i] -= opNum`
     - `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum`
     - `a[i + 2] -= opNum`
   - If any element becomes negative during this process, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop for that test case.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After processing the array up to the third last element, the program checks if the last two elements (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero.
   - If either of these elements is not zero, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Operation Handling:**
  - The program only considers the value of `a[i]` to determine the number of operations (`opNum`). However, it should consider the constraints on `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]` as well. Specifically, `a[i+1]` must be at least `2 * opNum` and `a[i+2]` must be at least `opNum` for the operation to be valid.
  - The current implementation does not check these constraints, which can lead to incorrect results.

- **Negative Values:**
  - The program correctly identifies if any element becomes negative during the operations and immediately prints "NO". However, this check is not sufficient because the problem requires all elements to be exactly zero, not just non-negative.

- **Final Check:**
  - The final check only considers the last two elements. However, if any element before the last two is not zero, the answer should be "NO". The current implementation does not check these elements.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.

### Correctness: **False**
