Precondition: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can interactively query up to 3n times to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation and must ultimately identify a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.**
