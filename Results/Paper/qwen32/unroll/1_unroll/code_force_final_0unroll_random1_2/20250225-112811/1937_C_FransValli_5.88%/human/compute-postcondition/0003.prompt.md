You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can interactively query up to 3n times to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation and must ultimately identify a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        k = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n):
            print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                k = i
        
        best = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                best = i
        
        print('!', k, best, flush=True)
        
    #State: the indices \( k \) and \( \text{best} \) that maximize the bitwise XOR for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It interactively queries up to 3n times to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function's goal is to identify and return a pair of indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices (p_i ⊕ p_j) is maximized.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
