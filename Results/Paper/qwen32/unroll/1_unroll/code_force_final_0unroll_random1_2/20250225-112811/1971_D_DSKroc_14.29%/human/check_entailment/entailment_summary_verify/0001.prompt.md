You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It then calculates and prints the number of segments in the binary string, where a segment is defined as a contiguous substring of '1's.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string can be cut into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The key observation is that every time we encounter a transition from '1' to '0' in the string, it indicates that we need to cut the string at that point to ensure that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted string. This is because, in a sorted binary string, all '0's must come before all '1's. 

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string.
3. It initializes a counter to zero.
4. It iterates through the string and increments the counter every time it encounters a '1' followed by a '0'.
5. Finally, it prints the counter plus one (since the number of pieces is one more than the number of transitions).

### Example Walkthrough:

- For the input `11010`:
  - Transitions from '1' to '0': `11[0]10` and `110[1]0`
  - Number of transitions: 2
  - Minimum number of pieces: 2 + 1 = 3

- For the input `00000000`:
  - No transitions from '1' to '0'
  - Minimum number of pieces: 0 + 1 = 1

- For the input `1`:
  - No transitions from '1' to '0'
  - Minimum number of pieces: 0 + 1 = 1

- For the input `10`:
  - Transition from '1' to '0': `[1]0`
  - Number of transitions: 1
  - Minimum number of pieces: 1 + 1 = 2

- For the input `0001111`:
  - No transitions from '1' to '0'
  - Minimum number of pieces: 0 + 1 = 1

- For the input `0110`:
  - Transition from '1' to '0': `01[1]0`
  - Number of transitions: 1
  - Minimum number of pieces: 1 + 1 = 2

The program correctly computes the minimum number of pieces for each test case as per the provided examples.
