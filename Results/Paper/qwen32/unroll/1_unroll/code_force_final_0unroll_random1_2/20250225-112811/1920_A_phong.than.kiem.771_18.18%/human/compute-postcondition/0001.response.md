The code snippet `index = string.find(substring)` finds the first occurrence of `substring` within `string` and assigns the starting index of this occurrence to the variable `index`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, `index` is assigned the value `-1`.

Given the initial state, `string` and `substring` are strings, and `indices` is an empty list. The variable `index` is introduced and assigned a value based on the result of `string.find(substring)`.

Output State: **`string` and `substring` are values of type string, where `substring` is used to find all starting indices of its occurrences within `string`; `indices` is an empty list; `index` is the starting index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` or -1 if `substring` is not found.**
