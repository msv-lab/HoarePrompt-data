Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description. Let's break down why:

1. **Misinterpretation of Commands**: The function `func_1` incorrectly interprets the commands 'L' and 'R'. Instead of removing elements from the array and recalculating the product of the remaining elements, it simply collects elements based on the command and then computes the product of the collected elements in reverse order. This does not match the problem's requirement to calculate the product of all remaining elements after each command is processed.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of elements collected in `b` in reverse order and then reverses the result to match the required output. However, the product should be calculated based on the array's state after processing each command, not just the order in which elements were collected.

3. **Inefficient Calculation**: The program does not efficiently handle the product calculation. It should ideally maintain a running product and adjust it based on the removed element, but the current implementation does not do this.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
