You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

            r -= 1
        
    #State: The list `b` will contain all elements of `a` but in a new order determined by the string `s`. The indices `l` and `r` will be `n` and `-1` respectively, as `l` will have been incremented `n` times and `r` decremented `n` times, assuming all 'L's and 'R's are used to their full extent. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

    #Output State:
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `ans` is `[p1, p2, ..., pn]` where each `pi` is the cumulative product modulo `m` of the elements of `b` in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list [pn, ..., p2, p1] where each pi is the cumulative product modulo m of the elements of b in reverse order, but now the list is in the opposite order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It rearranges the elements of `a` based on the instructions in `s`, computes the cumulative product modulo `m` of the rearranged list in reverse order, and returns the resulting list in reverse order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` and `m`: length of the array and the modulus.
     - `a`: array of `n` integers.
     - `s`: string of `n` commands ('L' or 'R').

2. **Processing:**
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array `a`.
     - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `n` integers representing the remainders as described above.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to point to the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the command string `s` and appends the corresponding element (`a[l]` for 'L', `a[r]` for 'R') to the list `b`.
   - After constructing the list `b`, it calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the remainder when divided by `m`, and stores these results in `ans`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which represents the remainders in the correct order.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic in Processing:**
  - The program does not correctly compute the product of the current state of the array `a` for each command. Instead, it constructs a new list `b` based on the commands and then computes the product of this new list.
  - This approach does not reflect the actual state of the array `a` after each command, as required by the problem.

### Correct Approach:
- For each command, compute the product of the current state of the array `a` and take the remainder when divided by `m`.
- Update the array `a` based on the command ('L' or 'R').

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement. It constructs a new list based on the commands and computes the product of this new list, which does not reflect the actual state of the array `a` after each command.
