Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the described logic. Here's why:

1. The program does not calculate the product of all elements in the array at each step before removing an element based on the command. Instead, it collects either the leftmost or rightmost element into a new list `b` and then calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

2. The problem specifies that, for each command, the remainder of the product of all elements in the current state of the array `a` should be calculated and then the appropriate element should be removed. The program does not follow this order.

Here is a corrected version of the code that properly implements the required logic:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for v in a:
        product = product * v % m
    
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m) % m  # Remove a[l] from the product
            l += 1
        else:
            product = product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m) % m  # Remove a[r] from the product
            r -= 1
    return ans
```

In this corrected version:
- The initial product of all elements in the array `a` is calculated.
- For each command, the product is updated by removing the appropriate element using modular multiplicative inverse (which is calculated using `pow(a[i], m - 2, m)` for a prime `m` or using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for general `m`).
- The product is then appended to the `ans` list, which is returned as the result.
