You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters and prints 'NO' if the string contains exactly two distinct characters, otherwise it prints 'YES'. If the string is not already sorted in ascending order, it prints the string sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it prints the string sorted in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and check if it meets the requirements of the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`, or report that it's impossible.
- For each test case, if no such string `r` exists, output "NO".
- Otherwise, output "YES" and the rearranged string `r`.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Handling Strings with Unique Characters**:
   - The program first checks if the number of unique characters in `s` is exactly 2. If so, it outputs "NO". This is a valid check because if `s` has only two unique characters, any rearrangement will result in a string that is either identical to `s` or its reverse (which could also be identical if the string is symmetrical, e.g., "aabb").
   
2. **Rearranging Strings**:
   - If the number of unique characters is not 2, the program proceeds to rearrange the string.
   - It sorts the string in ascending order (`b = ''.join(sorted(s))`) and in descending order (`c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`).
   - It then checks if the ascending sorted string `b` is the same as the original string `s`. If it is, it outputs the descending sorted string `c`. Otherwise, it outputs the ascending sorted string `b`.
   - This logic ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string as long as there are more than two unique characters.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Strings with All Identical Characters**: The program correctly handles these by outputting "NO" if there are only two unique characters.
- **Strings with More Than Two Unique Characters**: The program correctly rearranges the string to ensure it is different from the original.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. It correctly identifies when it's impossible to rearrange the string to be different and provides a valid rearrangement when possible.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and meets the requirements of the problem description. It outputs "NO" when it's impossible to rearrange the string to be different from the original (i.e., when the string has only two unique characters) and provides a valid rearrangement otherwise.
