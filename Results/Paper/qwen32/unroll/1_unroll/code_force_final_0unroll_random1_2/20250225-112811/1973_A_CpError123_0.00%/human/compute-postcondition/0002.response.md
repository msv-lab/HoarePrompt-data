To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `resultats` list based on the given conditions. The loop iterates over each tuple in the `cas_de_test` list, calculates the total points, and then checks several conditions to determine the value to append to the `resultats` list.

1. **Total Points Calculation**: `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`
2. **Odd Total Points Check**: If `total_points` is odd, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next iteration.
3. **Total Matches Calculation**: `total_matchs = total_points // 2`
4. **Total Matches and Highest Score Check**: If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next iteration.
5. **Egalites Calculation**: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
6. **Egalites Check**: If `egalites` is less than 0, append `-1` to `resultats`. Otherwise, append `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

The `resultats` list is built based on these checks and calculations. The final state of `resultats` will depend on the specific values in `cas_de_test`.

Since we don't have specific values for `cas_de_test`, we can't compute the exact values that will be appended to `resultats`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the `resultats` list.

**Output State**: **resultats is a list of integers where each integer is either -1 or a non-negative integer representing the number of matches that ended in a draw for each test case in cas_de_test.**

This description captures the essence of how the `resultats` list is populated based on the given loop logic.
