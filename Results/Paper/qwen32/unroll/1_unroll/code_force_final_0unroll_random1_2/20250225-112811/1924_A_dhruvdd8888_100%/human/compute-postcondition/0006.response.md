The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state of `s` must be adjusted to ensure it has at least one character.

Given the constraints, `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and `m` must be at least 1; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0**
