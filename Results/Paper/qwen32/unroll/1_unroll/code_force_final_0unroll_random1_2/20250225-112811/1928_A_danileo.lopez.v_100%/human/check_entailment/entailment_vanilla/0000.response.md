Reasoning:
1. The problem states that Bob can only form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange these two smaller rectangles into a new one with different dimensions (ignoring rotations).

2. The program checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If either dimension is even, it means that it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

3. If `a` is even, the program divides `a` by 2 to get two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a // 2` by `b`. If `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes" because a new rectangle can be formed.

4. Similarly, if `b` is even, the program divides `b` by 2 to get two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a` by `b // 2`. If `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes" because a new rectangle can be formed.

5. If neither dimension is even, the program prints "No" because it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.

6. However, the program does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions are even. For example, for a 4x4 rectangle, the program would incorrectly print "No" because it checks each dimension separately and finds that neither 4 // 2 (which is 2) is different from the other dimension (4). But, a 4x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x4 rectangles and then rearranged into an 8x2 rectangle, which is a different rectangle.

7. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
