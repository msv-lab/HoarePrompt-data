Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles of equal size, and then these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The logic in the program only checks if one of the dimensions (a or b) is even and then divides it by 2. However, it does not consider the possibility of cutting the rectangle along the other dimension or combining the smaller rectangles in a different way.

Here is a counterexample:

For the input `3 3`, the program will output `No`. However, this is incorrect because the `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into two `2 x 1` rectangles and one `1 x 1` rectangle, and then the two `2 x 1` rectangles can be rearranged to form a `2 x 3` rectangle, which is different from the original `3 x 3` rectangle.

Another example is `4 3`. The program will output `No`, but it should output `Yes` because the `4 x 3` rectangle can be cut into two `2 x 3` rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a `3 x 4` rectangle, which is the same as `4 x 3` but considered different due to the problem's definition.

To fix the program, we need to consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and check if the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. The current logic is too restrictive and does not cover all possible valid cases.
