The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It checks if either dimension is even and whether the rectangle can be split into two non-equal parts by halving one of the even dimensions. If such a split is possible, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
