Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the resulting pieces of the original rectangle. Specifically, the program only checks if one of the sides of the rectangle is even and then attempts to cut the rectangle along that side, but it does not consider all possible ways to form a new rectangle from the resulting pieces.

For example, the program will output "No" for the input `3 2`, even though it is possible to cut the rectangle into two `3 x 1` pieces and then form a `1 x 6` rectangle. The program also incorrectly handles cases where the rectangle can be cut into two equal pieces along the shorter side, and these pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program simply checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If either dimension is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two pieces that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a new rectangle.
