Let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob wants to cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then tries to form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The program then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it checks if the resulting smaller rectangles after the cut can form a different rectangle.

### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if either dimension is even and whether the rectangle can be split into two non-equal parts by halving one of the even dimensions. If such a split is possible, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Even Dimension Check**:
   - If `a` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
   - If `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
   - If either of these smaller rectangles can be rearranged into a different rectangle (i.e., the dimensions of the new rectangle are not `a x b`), the program prints "Yes".

2. **Logic in the Program**:
   - The program correctly checks if `a` or `b` is even.
   - If `a` is even, it checks if `a/2` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `b` is even, it checks if `b/2` is not equal to `a`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If neither dimension is even, it prints "No".

3. **Handling Both Dimensions Even**:
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the program fails for cases where both dimensions are even, such as a `4x4` rectangle.
   - However, the program correctly handles this case. For a `4x4` rectangle, the program will check:
     - `a` is even (`4 % 2 == 0`), so it checks if `4/2` (which is `2`) is not equal to `b` (which is `4`). Since `2 != 4`, it prints "Yes".
     - Alternatively, if it checks `b` first, it will find that `b` is even (`4 % 2 == 0`), so it checks if `4/2` (which is `2`) is not equal to `a` (which is `4`). Since `2 != 4`, it prints "Yes".
   - Thus, the program correctly identifies that a `4x4` rectangle can be cut into two `2x4` rectangles and rearranged into an `8x2` rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases, including when both dimensions are even. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

**Final: False**
