In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variables `a` and `b` are defined inside the loop and are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states directly. 

Given this, the only variable in the loop head is `t`, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
