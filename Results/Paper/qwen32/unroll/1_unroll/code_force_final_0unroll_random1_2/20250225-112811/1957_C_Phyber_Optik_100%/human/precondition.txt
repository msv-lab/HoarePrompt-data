t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n.
