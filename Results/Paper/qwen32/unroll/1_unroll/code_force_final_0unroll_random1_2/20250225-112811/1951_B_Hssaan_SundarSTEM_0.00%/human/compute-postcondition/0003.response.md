Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of distinct integers and two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum of two values (`ans` and `ans1`) which are derived based on the relative ordering of the elements in the list, particularly in relation to the element at index `k-1`.**
