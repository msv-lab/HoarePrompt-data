t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three integers (n, m, k) such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), and k is even. The test case also contains two lists: a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) where each integer satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and a list of m integers (b_1, b_2, ..., b_m) where each integer satisfies 1 <= b_j <= 10^6. The sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.
