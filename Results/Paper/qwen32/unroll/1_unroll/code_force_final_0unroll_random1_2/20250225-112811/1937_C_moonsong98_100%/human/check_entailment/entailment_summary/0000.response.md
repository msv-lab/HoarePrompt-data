### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in the secret permutation \(p\) such that the bitwise XOR \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The program interacts with an external system to perform this task using a limited number of queries (at most \(3n\)).

Let's break down the provided functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b, c, d)`**:
    - This function is responsible for making a query to the external system.
    - It takes four indices \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) and asks the system to compare the bitwise OR of \(p_a \mid p_b\) with \(p_c \mid p_d\).
    - It returns the result of this comparison, which can be `<`, `>`, or `=`.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
    - This function outputs the final answer, which is the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).
    - It prints the indices to the standard output.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
    - This is the main function that orchestrates the process of finding the indices.
    - For \(n = 2\), it directly outputs the indices \(0\) and \(1\) because the maximum XOR for two numbers is always obtained from the pair \((0, 1)\) or \((1, 0)\).
    - For \(n > 2\), it performs the following steps:
        - **Finding the maximum element**:
            - It initializes `max_index` to 0.
            - It iterates through all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` to compare the bitwise OR of \(p_0 \mid p_{max\_index}\) with \(p_0 \mid p_i\).
            - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to \(i\).
        - **Finding the minimum elements**:
            - It initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
            - It iterates through all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` to compare the bitwise OR of \(p_{max\_index} \mid p_{min\_indices[0]}\) with \(p_{max\_index} \mid p_i\).
            - If the result is `<`, it updates `min_indices` to only contain \(i\).
            - If the result is `=`, it appends \(i\) to `min_indices`.
        - **Refining the minimum element**:
            - It initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
            - It iterates through all elements in `min_indices` (skipping `max_index`) and uses `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` to compare the bitwise OR of \(p_{min\_index} \mid p_{min\_index}\) with \(p_{min\_index} \mid p_i\).
            - If the result is `=`, it updates `min_index` to \(i\).
        - Finally, it calls `func_2(max_index, min_index)` to output the indices.

The logic of the program is based on finding the maximum element and then finding the minimum element such that the XOR of these two elements is maximized. The program uses the properties of bitwise operations and the constraints of the problem (up to \(3n\) queries) to achieve this.

### Correctness:

The program's logic is sound and follows the problem's requirements. It efficiently narrows down the candidates for the indices that maximize the XOR by leveraging the comparison results from the external system. Given the constraints and the problem's nature, the program is designed to work correctly within the allowed number of queries.

**Correctness: True**
