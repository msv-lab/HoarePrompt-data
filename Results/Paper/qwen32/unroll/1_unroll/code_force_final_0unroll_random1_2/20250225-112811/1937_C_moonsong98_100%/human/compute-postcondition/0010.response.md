To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and initial state.

The loop iterates `n` times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. In each iteration, the function `func_1` is called with the arguments `max_index`, `min_indices[0]`, `max_index`, and `i`. The result of `func_1` is then checked:
- If `res` is `'<'`, `min_indices` is updated to contain only the current index `i`.
- If `res` is `'='`, the current index `i` is appended to `min_indices`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `max_index` is `n-1`.
- `min_indices` is a list containing the single element `max_index`.

The behavior of `func_1` is not specified, but we can infer the following:
- If `func_1` always returns `'<'` for any comparison where `i` is not `max_index`, then `min_indices` will be updated to `[i]` in the first iteration where `i` is not `max_index`, and it will not be updated again.
- If `func_1` returns `'='` for any comparison, then `min_indices` will grow to include all indices that are considered equal to `min_indices[0]`.

However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1`, we can only consider the most general case. If we assume that `func_1` behaves such that it only returns `'<'` for the first index that is smaller than `max_index` and `'='` for all other indices that are equal to `max_index`, then the final `min_indices` will include all indices that are considered equal to `max_index`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact behavior of `func_1`, we can consider the most straightforward case where `func_1` returns `'<'` for the first index that is not `max_index` and `'='` for all other indices that are equal to `max_index`.

Therefore, the output state can be:
- If `func_1` returns `'<'` for the first index that is not `max_index` and `'='` for all other indices that are equal to `max_index`, then `min_indices` will include all indices that are considered equal to `max_index`.

Given the initial state and the behavior described, the output state will be:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `max_index` is n-1; `min_indices` is a list containing all indices that are considered equal to `max_index` by `func_1`.**
