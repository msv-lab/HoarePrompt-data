Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `max_index` is n-1; `min_indices` is a list containing the single element `max_index`.**

In simple terms, the value of `n` remains the same, `max_index` remains `n-1`, and a new list `min_indices` is created containing just the value of `max_index`.
