To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided loop and understand what it does. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`.
2. **Loop Code**:
    ```python
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
    ```
    - The loop reads an integer from standard input, which determines the number of iterations.
    - For each iteration, it calls the `solve()` function.

Since the loop only iterates and calls the `solve()` function, and there are no variables in the function signature of `func_1` that are modified or initialized within the loop, the state of `func_1` remains unchanged except for the implicit iteration count.

However, since the problem asks us to describe the output state only in terms of variables explicitly mentioned in the loop head and body, and there are no such variables (only the loop variable `_` and the function call `solve()`), we can conclude that no variables are affected in the context of the function `func_1`.

Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`.**
