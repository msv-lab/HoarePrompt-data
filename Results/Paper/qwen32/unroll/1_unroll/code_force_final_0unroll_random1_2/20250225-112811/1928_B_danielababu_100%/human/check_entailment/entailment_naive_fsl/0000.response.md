Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any function that actually solves the problem described. The code includes several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) that perform various operations like reading input, sorting, and calculating prefix and suffix products, but none of these functions address the task of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

To solve the problem, we need to identify the optimal permutation to add to the array such that the maximum frequency of any element in the resulting array is maximized. The current code does not implement this logic at all, making it incorrect based on the problem description.
