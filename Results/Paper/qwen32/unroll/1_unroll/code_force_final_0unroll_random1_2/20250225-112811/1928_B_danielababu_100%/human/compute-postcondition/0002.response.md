The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`. The loop iterates from the last index of `arr` to 0 in reverse order. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, because `len(arr) - 1` must be a valid index.

Given this, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `arr` must be a list with at least one element.
- `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1` before the loop starts, but since the loop initializes `i` automatically, we don't need to set it manually in the state description.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1**
