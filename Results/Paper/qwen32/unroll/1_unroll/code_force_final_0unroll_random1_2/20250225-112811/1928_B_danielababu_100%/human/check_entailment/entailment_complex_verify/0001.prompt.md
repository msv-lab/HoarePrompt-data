You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vasya has two hobbies — adding permutations^{\dagger} to arrays and finding
the most frequently occurring element. Recently, he found an array a and
decided to find out the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in
the array a that he can obtain after adding some permutation to the array a .

More formally, Vasya must choose exactly one permutation p_1, p_2, p_3,
\ldots, p_n of length n , and then change the elements of the array a
according to the rule a_i := a_i + p_i . After that, Vasya counts how many
times each number occurs in the array a and takes the maximum of these values.
You need to determine the maximum value he can obtain.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then
follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum number of elements
equal to the same number after the operation of adding a permutation.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to choose p = [2, 1] . Then after
applying the operation, the array a will be [3, 3] , in which the number 3
occurs twice, so the answer is 2 .

In the second test case, one of the optimal options is p = [2, 3, 1, 4] .
After applying the operation, the array a will be [9, 4, 5, 5] . Since the
number 5 occurs twice, the answer is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not contain the actual logic to solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation to the array. The code provided includes several utility functions for input handling and some operations on arrays, but it lacks the core logic to solve the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program should do to solve the problem:

1. **Input Reading**: The program needs to read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program should determine the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number after adding a permutation.
3. **Output**: The program should output the result for each test case.

The core logic involves:
- Using the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` and checking if adding it to the array can maximize the frequency of any element.
- The key insight is that the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` ensures that the smallest element in the array gets the smallest increment, the second smallest gets the second smallest increment, and so on. This can help in maximizing the frequency of some element in the array.

The provided code does not implement this logic. It only includes utility functions for input and some operations on arrays, but does not address the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not contain the logic to solve the problem, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
