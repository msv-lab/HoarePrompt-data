You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue.

1. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it immediately returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists. This is correct because the Manhattan value is always even for any permutation.
   - It calculates `max_k`, the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists. This is also correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation with the specified Manhattan value `k`.
   - It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates through the permutation in reverse order, adjusting elements to increase the Manhattan value.
   - The logic for adjusting elements and calculating the Manhattan value is complex and involves helper functions `func_2` and `func_3`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the permutation to increase the Manhattan value by a specific amount `k`.
   - It swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `-c - k`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the permutation to increase the Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `c - 1`.

However, the logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is not straightforward and may not handle all edge cases correctly. Let's consider a specific test case where the program might fail:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2
```
- For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program should output a permutation with a Manhattan value of 2.
- The correct permutation could be `[2, 1, 3]`, which has a Manhattan value of `|2 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2`.

However, the provided program might not correctly generate this permutation or any other valid permutation for `k = 2`. The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is complex and may not cover all possible scenarios to generate a valid permutation for every possible `k`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly, as demonstrated by the test case above.

Correctness: **False**
