Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly convert 24-hour format to 12-hour format:

1. **Handling of Hours 13 to 23**: When converting hours from 13 to 23 to the 12-hour format, the program should display the hour as a number between 01 and 11, but it incorrectly formats hours 13 to 19 with a leading zero. For example, 13 should be converted to "01", but the program will output "01" as "01" instead of "1".
2. **Handling of '12' PM**: The program correctly converts '12' in the 24-hour format to '12' PM, but it fails to handle '00' in the 24-hour format correctly, which should be converted to '12' AM.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[2:]
        period = 'AM'
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h == 12:
            period = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            period = 'PM'
        
        print(f"{h:02}:{m} {period}")

func_1()
```

This version correctly handles all edge cases and ensures the output is formatted as required.
