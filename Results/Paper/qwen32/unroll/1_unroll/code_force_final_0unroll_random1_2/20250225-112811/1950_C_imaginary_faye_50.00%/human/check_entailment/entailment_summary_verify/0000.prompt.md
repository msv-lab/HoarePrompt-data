You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of time entries, followed by `t` lines of strings in the format "hh:mm" representing times in 24-hour format. It then prints each time converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for certain cases:

1. **Leading Zeroes in Hours**: The program does not handle leading zeroes correctly for hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format. For example, it prints "9" instead of "09" for times like "09:41".

2. **Midnight and Noon Handling**: The program incorrectly handles "00:00" and "12:00". It should print "12:00 AM" for "00:00" and "12:00 PM" for "12:00", but it prints "12:00 AM" for both.

3. **Incorrect AM/PM Decision**: The program incorrectly decides between AM and PM. For example, it prints "PM" for times from "12:00" to "12:59", but it should print "AM" for "12:00" and "PM" for "13:00" to "23:59".

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def convert_to_12_hour_format(hh, mm):
    hh = int(hh)
    period = "AM"
    if hh == 0:
        hh = 12
    elif hh == 12:
        period = "PM"
    elif hh > 12:
        hh -= 12
        period = "PM"
    
    return f"{hh:02}:{mm} {period}"

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input().split(':')
        print(convert_to_12_hour_format(s[0], s[1]))

func_1()
```

This corrected version handles all edge cases and formats the output correctly.
