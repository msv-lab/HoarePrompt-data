The code snippet `n, m = func_7()` assigns the values returned by the function `func_7()` to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specified that `n` and `m` were positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will be updated to the values returned by `func_7()`. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers remains valid, but their specific values are now determined by the output of `func_7()`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**
