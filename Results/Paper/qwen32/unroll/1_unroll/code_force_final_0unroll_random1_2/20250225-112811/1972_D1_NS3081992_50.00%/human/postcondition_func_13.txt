The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, and two integers `m` and `k`. It checks if the value of `k` can be reduced by the sum of the differences between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after this reduction, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
