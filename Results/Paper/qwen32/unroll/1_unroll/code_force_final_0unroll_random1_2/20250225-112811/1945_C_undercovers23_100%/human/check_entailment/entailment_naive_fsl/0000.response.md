Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are a few issues:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The program calculates the percentage of zeros and ones on each side of the road, but this is not the correct approach. The problem requires at least half of the residents on each side to be satisfied, which translates to at least `ceil(i/2)` zeros on the left side and at least `ceil((n-i)/2)` ones on the right side. The program uses percentage calculations which are not appropriate for this problem.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle the cases where the road is placed before the first house or after the last house. It should check if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the condition and should update the result accordingly.

3. **Finding Minimum Distance**: The program calculates the minimum distance but does not handle the case when the road should be placed before the first house or after the last house. It should consider these cases as possible candidates for the minimum distance.

4. **Counting Zeros and Ones**: The program counts the total number of zeros and ones at the beginning and then calculates the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides. This is correct, but the comparison should be based on the ceiling of half the number of houses on each side, not on percentage.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        if not lst:
            if z >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                lst.append(0)
            if o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                lst.append(n)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n / 2 - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(n / 2 - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        final.sort()
        print(final[0])

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for placing the road and considers the edge cases where the road is placed before the first house or after the last house.
