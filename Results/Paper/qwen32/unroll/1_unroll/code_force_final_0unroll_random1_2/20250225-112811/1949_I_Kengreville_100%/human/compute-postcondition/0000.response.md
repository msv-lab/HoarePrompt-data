Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]`, `y[i]` are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= `x[i]`, `y[i]` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, `coef` is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients, and `tot` and `bipartite` are variables used to keep track of the total and bipartiteness during the DFS traversal respectively.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. All other variables retain their initial states as specified in the initial conditions.
