n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9, visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients, and tot and bipartite are variables used to keep track of the total and bipartiteness during the DFS traversal respectively.
