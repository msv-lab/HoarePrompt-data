Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines if there exists at least one bipartite component of disks (circles) with a non-zero total count after performing a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal. It reads the number of disks and their properties (center coordinates and radius), then checks each component of disks to see if it is bipartite and has a non-zero total count. If such a component is found, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".**
