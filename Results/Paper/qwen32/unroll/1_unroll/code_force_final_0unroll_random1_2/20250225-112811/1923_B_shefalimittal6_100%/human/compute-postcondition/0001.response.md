Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of n monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of n monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second. `n` is the length of the list `a`. `sorted_indices` is a list of indices of `x` sorted by the absolute values of the elements in `x`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that the variables `a`, `x`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged. A new variable `sorted_indices` is created, which contains the indices of the list `x` sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`.
