The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers for each test case. It then constructs and prints a list of integers based on specific rules involving the minimum unused non-negative integer and the absolute differences between the list elements and this minimum integer. The function outputs a space-separated list of integers for each test case, followed by an empty line.
