In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range `n`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `n` because it directly determines the number of iterations.

Let's analyze the provided state and the loop:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable is not directly related to the loop's execution.
- `n` is an input integer. This is the variable that controls the loop's execution.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers. This list's length is controlled by `n`, but its contents do not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The length of this list should also be `n`.
- `mex` is an empty list.
- `minn` is 0.
- `used` is an empty dictionary.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
For this loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`, `used`) do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes, as they are not part of the loop's head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
