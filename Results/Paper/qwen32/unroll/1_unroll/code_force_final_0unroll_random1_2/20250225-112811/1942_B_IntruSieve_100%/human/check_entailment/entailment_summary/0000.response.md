### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem by constructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given rules. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex`: This list is intended to store the values of the permutation `p`.
   - `minn`: This variable keeps track of the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used yet.
   - `used`: This dictionary keeps track of which integers have been used in the permutation `p`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and marks `minn` as used. It then updates `minn` to the next smallest unused integer.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it calculates the value to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and marks this value as used.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p` (stored in `mex`), it prints the values of `mex` as a space-separated list.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Handling Non-Positive Values**: The program incorrectly handles the case when `arr[i]` is non-positive. The logic `abs(arr[i] - minn)` does not necessarily yield the correct value for the permutation `p`. The correct logic should be to determine the smallest unused non-negative integer that, when subtracted from `minn`, equals `arr[i]`.
  
- **Updating `minn`**: The program updates `minn` only when `arr[i]` is positive. This might lead to incorrect results because `minn` should be updated every time a new number is used in the permutation, regardless of the sign of `arr[i]`.

### Correct Approach:

- For each `arr[i]`, determine the smallest unused non-negative integer `x` such that `MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - p_i = arr[i]`.
- This means that `x - arr[i]` should be the smallest unused non-negative integer.
- Mark `x` as used and append it to the permutation `p`.
- Update `minn` to the next smallest unused non-negative integer.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the program, the current implementation does not correctly construct the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
