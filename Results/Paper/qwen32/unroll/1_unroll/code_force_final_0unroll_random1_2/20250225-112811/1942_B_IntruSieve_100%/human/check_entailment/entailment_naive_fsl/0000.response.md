Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Let's analyze the issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX and Permutation Elements**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the elements of \( p \) by directly appending the MEX or a modified MEX value to the `mex` list. This does not ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated for each step and that the resulting permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

2. **Handling Negative Values in \( a \)**:
   - The program handles negative values in \( a \) by appending \( \texttt{abs}(a_i - \texttt{minn}) \) to the `mex` list. This is incorrect because the value of \( p_i \) should be derived based on the MEX minus \( a_i \), not the absolute difference.

3. **Maintaining Used Values**:
   - The program maintains a dictionary `used` to track the values that have been used in the permutation. However, the logic for updating `minn` and ensuring the next MEX value is correctly chosen is flawed.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly reconstructs the permutation \( p \):

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = [False] * n
    p = []

    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while used[mex]:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex)
        used[mex] = True
        if mex != a[i] + p[i]:
            raise ValueError("No valid permutation exists based on the given array a.")

    print(" ".join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and that the permutation \( p \) is constructed such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) for each \( i \). The original program fails to meet these requirements, hence it is incorrect.
