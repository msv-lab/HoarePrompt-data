The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list called `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the specific integers that were input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; For each test case, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
