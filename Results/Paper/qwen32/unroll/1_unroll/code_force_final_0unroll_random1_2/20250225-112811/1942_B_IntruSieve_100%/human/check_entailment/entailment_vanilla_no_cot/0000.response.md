Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The logic for determining the MEX and constructing `p` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case when `a[i]` is negative and does not ensure that the constructed `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The program attempts to keep track of the MEX using a variable `minn` and a dictionary `used` to store used numbers. However, it does not correctly update `minn` when a negative `a[i]` is encountered.

2. **Negative `a[i]` Handling**: When `a[i]` is negative, the program incorrectly calculates the next element of `p` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. This does not guarantee that the calculated value will be the correct next element of `p` that satisfies the MEX condition.

3. **Updating `used` Dictionary**: The program correctly updates the `used` dictionary to mark numbers as used, but it does not correctly adjust `minn` to point to the next smallest unused number after adding a new number to `p`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = 0
    used = set()
    p = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex - arr[i])
        used.add(p[-1])
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

In this corrected version:
- We maintain a `mex` variable that starts at 0 and is incremented until it finds an unused number.
- For each `a[i]`, we calculate `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and add it to the `used` set.
- We then print the constructed `p` for each test case.
