The provided loop simply iterates over the list `mex` and prints each element followed by a space. This loop does not modify the list `mex`, the variable `minn`, or the dictionary `used`. It only prints the elements of `mex`.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state for `mex`, `minn`, and `used`, except that the elements of `mex` will be printed.

Output State: **mex is a list of integers constructed based on the rules specified in the loop, minn is the smallest integer that has not been used after the loop completes, and used is a dictionary containing all the integers that have been used during the loop.**
