The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the counts of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts. The printed value is either the total number of individuals adjusted by a third of the sum of extroverts and universals, or -1 if the number of universals is less than the remainder when the sum of extroverts and universals is divided by 3.
