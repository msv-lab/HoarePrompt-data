Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic Error**: The logic for calculating the number of tents is incorrect. The program attempts to combine the number of extroverts and universals (`b += c`) and then uses a formula to determine the number of tents, but it does not properly account for the constraints on introverts and extroverts.

2. **Handling of Introverts**: The program does not separately allocate tents for introverts, who require one tent each.

3. **Handling of Extroverts**: The program does not ensure that extroverts are placed in tents with exactly two others, and it does not correctly account for the remainder when dividing extroverts by three.

4. **Combining Extroverts and Universals**: The program combines extroverts and universals into a single group (`b += c`), which is not appropriate because universals can be placed in tents with either one or two others, whereas extroverts must be in tents with exactly two others.

5. **Output Condition**: The program uses a condition to determine whether to output the calculated number of tents or `-1`, but this condition does not correctly handle all cases where it should output `-1`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Allocate one tent per introvert.
- Try to pair extroverts with universals or other extroverts to form groups of three.
- Use any remaining universals to fill in incomplete groups of three.
- If there are any extroverts left who cannot be paired into groups of three, output `-1`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        tents = a  # Each introvert needs one tent
        c -= min(c, b)  # Use universals to pair with extroverts
        b -= min(c, b)  # Reduce extroverts by the number paired with universals
        if b % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)  # If extroverts cannot be fully paired into groups of three
        else:
            tents += b // 3  # Add tents for groups of three extroverts
            print(tents)

func()
```

This corrected program should handle all the cases as per the problem statement.
