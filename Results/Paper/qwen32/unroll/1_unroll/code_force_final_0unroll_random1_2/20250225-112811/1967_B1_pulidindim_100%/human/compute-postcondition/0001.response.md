The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is set by the `range(t)` function in the loop head.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The initial value of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts since it will be set to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is at least 1. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is controlled by the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0 (this will be set by the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)**

However, since the question asks only to adjust the states of objects in the loop head and `i` is set by the loop, we only need to ensure `t` is adjusted if necessary. Given the problem statement, `t` is already within the valid range, so no adjustment is needed for `t` either.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
