You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. Additionally, the sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.

            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: After executing all iterations, `t` test cases will be processed, and for each test case, the final value of `ans` will be printed. The variables `n`, `m`, `count`, and `g` will not retain their values after each iteration of the outer loop as they are recalculated or reinitialized within each loop. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it only dictates the number of test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements.

The problem requires finding pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The given program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then iterates through values of `count` up to `m`, calculating the number of valid pairs for each `count`. However, the logic for counting valid pairs is incorrect.

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the error:
- Input: `n = 3, m = 3`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Explanation of expected output:
  - Valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)
  - For (1,1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1,1) = 1\)
  - For (2,1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2,1) = 1\)
  - For (2,2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2,2) = 2\)
  - For (3,1): \(3 + 1 = 4\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3,1) = 1\)

Now, let's see what the provided program outputs for this test case:
- The program initializes `ans` to `n = 3`.
- It then starts the loop with `count = 2`:
  - For `count = 2`, it calculates `countmins = 1`, `g = int(3 / 2) = 1`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = 0`.
  - It then adds `int(0 / 2) + 1` to `ans`, which is `1`.
  - The new value of `ans` is `4`.
- For `count = 3`, it calculates `countmins = 2`, `g = int(3 / 3) = 1`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = -1`.
  - Since `g < countmins`, the loop breaks.
- The final value of `ans` is `4`, which seems correct for this test case, but let's consider another test case to see if the logic holds.

Let's consider another test case:
- Input: `n = 10, m = 8`
- Expected Output: `14`
- Explanation of expected output:
  - Valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)

Now, let's see what the provided program outputs for this test case:
- The program initializes `ans` to `n = 10`.
- It then starts the loop with `count = 2`:
  - For `count = 2`, it calculates `countmins = 1`, `g = int(10 / 2) = 5`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = 4`.
  - It then adds `int(4 / 2) + 1` to `ans`, which is `3`.
  - The new value of `ans` is `13`.
- For `count = 3`, it calculates `countmins = 2`, `g = int(10 / 3) = 3`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = 1`.
  - It then adds `int(1 / 3) + 1` to `ans`, which is `1`.
  - The new value of `ans` is `14`.
- For `count = 4`, it calculates `countmins = 3`, `g = int(10 / 4) = 2`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = -1`.
  - Since `g < countmins`, the loop breaks.
- The final value of `ans` is `14`, which is correct for this test case, but the logic is still suspect.

However, the provided program does not correctly handle all cases, and the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. The program does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is:
Correctness: **False**.
