Output State: **After executing all iterations, `t` test cases will be processed, and for each test case, the final value of `ans` will be printed. The variables `n`, `m`, `count`, and `g` will not retain their values after each iteration of the outer loop as they are recalculated or reinitialized within each loop. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it only dictates the number of test cases.**
