Reasoning:
The given program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to the described algorithm. Let's break down the steps the program takes and verify if they correctly perform the decoding:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings (`data`).
   - It then reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`).

2. **Decoding Process (function `func_1`):**
   - For each encoded string `b`, the program first constructs the auxiliary string `r`:
     - It creates a set of characters from `b` to get unique characters.
     - It sorts these unique characters alphabetically to form `r`.
   - It then creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character of `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the decoded strings, each on a new line.

The program correctly follows the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` correctly by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string `b`. It then creates a mapping from `r` to its reverse and uses this mapping to decode `b` accurately. The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
