The code creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in the string `r` is mapped to a character in reverse order from the end of `r`. Specifically, the character at index `i` in `r` is mapped to the character at index `-(i + 1)` in `r`.

Given that `r` is a string containing unique characters sorted in ascending order, the mapping will pair the smallest character with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and 1 <= len(b) <= 2 * 10^5. The length of the list `encoded` is `t`, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all strings in `encoded` does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `r` is a string containing unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order. `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order from the end of `r`.**
