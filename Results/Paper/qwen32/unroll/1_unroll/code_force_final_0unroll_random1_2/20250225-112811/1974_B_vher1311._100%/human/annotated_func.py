#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and 1 <= len(b) <= 2 * 10^5. The length of the list encoded is t, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all strings in encoded does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string where each character from the strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a single string where each character from the input strings is replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed order of a sorted, deduplicated string of all characters from the input list.
