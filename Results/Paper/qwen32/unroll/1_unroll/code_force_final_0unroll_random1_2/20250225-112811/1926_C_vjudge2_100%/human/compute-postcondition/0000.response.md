Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the length of `num` is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; `a` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `a` has been assigned the value 0. The list `num` remains unchanged, still containing integers where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the length of `num` is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
