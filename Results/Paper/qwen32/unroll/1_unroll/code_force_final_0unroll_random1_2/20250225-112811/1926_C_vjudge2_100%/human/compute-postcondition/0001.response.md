The loop condition is `while num != 0:`. This condition checks if `num` is not equal to 0. However, `num` is described as a list of integers, not a single integer. Therefore, the condition `num != 0` is always `True` because a list will never be equal to an integer 0. This means that the loop can certainly execute one time as long as `num` is a non-empty list.

Since the condition will always be `True` for a non-empty list, no adjustment to the state of `num` is necessary to ensure the loop executes. The state of `a` also does not affect the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state right before the loop can remain as it is.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the length of `num` is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; `a` is 0**
