To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the loop does with each test case. The loop reads four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, respectively. It then calculates a count `cnt` based on these values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the loop does for each test case:
1. It checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all the same and odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1.
2. It then adds to `cnt` the floor division of each count by 2.
3. Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

Since the loop executes independently for each test case and the output is printed for each test case, the output state will be a sequence of printed values, one for each test case.

Given that the problem asks for the output state in the format similar to the initial execution state, we need to describe the final output state after all iterations in terms of the printed values. Since the output is printed for each test case and not stored in a variable, we can describe the output state as a sequence of printed integers.

However, since the problem specifies the format as Output State: **output state**, and the output is a sequence of integers printed for each test case, we can describe the output state as the sequence of these integers.

Since the problem does not provide specific test cases, we cannot provide a concrete sequence of integers. But we can describe the output state in terms of the process.

Output State: **A sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the calculated `cnt` for that test case.**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume the following test cases:
- Test Case 1: 1 1 1 1
- Test Case 2: 2 2 2 2
- Test Case 3: 3 3 3 3

For these test cases, the output would be:
- For Test Case 1: `cnt = 1 + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1`
- For Test Case 2: `cnt = 0 + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
- For Test Case 3: `cnt = 1 + floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`

So, the output state would be: **1 4 5**

Given the problem's format requirements, we can generalize this as:
Output State: **A sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the calculated `cnt` for that test case.**

Since no specific test cases are provided, the output state in a generalized form is:
Output State: **A sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the calculated `cnt` for that test case.**
