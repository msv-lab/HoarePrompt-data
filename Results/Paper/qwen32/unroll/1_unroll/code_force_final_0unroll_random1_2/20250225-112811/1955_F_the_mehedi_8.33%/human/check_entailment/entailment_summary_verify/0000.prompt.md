You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Let's analyze why:

The logic in the program includes:
1. Checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, and if so, incrementing the count by 1.
2. Adding the floor division of each count by 2 to the count.

However, this logic does not fully capture the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. Specifically, the program does not account for the XOR properties and the optimal removal strategy in all cases.

For example, let's consider the test case:
```
1 1 1 1
```
According to the problem statement, Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero. Let's analyze the sequence step-by-step:
- Initial sequence: `[1, 1, 1, 1]` (XOR = 0, Bob wins)
- Remove one 1: `[1, 1, 1]` (XOR = 1, Alice wins)
- Remove one 1: `[1, 1]` (XOR = 0, Bob wins)
- Remove one 1: `[1]` (XOR = 1, Alice wins)
- Remove the last 1: `[]` (No more numbers, game ends)

In this case, Bob wins twice. However, the program would output 2, which is correct for this specific case. But let's consider another example:
```
2 2 2 2
```
- Initial sequence: `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (XOR = 0, Bob wins)
- Remove one 2: `[2, 2, 2]` (XOR = 2, Alice wins)
- Remove one 2: `[2, 2]` (XOR = 0, Bob wins)
- Remove one 2: `[2]` (XOR = 2, Alice wins)
- Remove the last 2: `[]` (No more numbers, game ends)

In this case, Bob wins twice. The program would output 4 (2 from each count of 2 divided by 2), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when the counts of numbers do not fit the specific conditions checked in the code. Hence, the program is incorrect.
