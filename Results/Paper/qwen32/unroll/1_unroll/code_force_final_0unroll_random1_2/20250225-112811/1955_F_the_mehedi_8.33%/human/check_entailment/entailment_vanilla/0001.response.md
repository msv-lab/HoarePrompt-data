To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the logic implemented in the program step-by-step.

The problem is about determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the properties of the XOR operation:

1. XOR of a number with itself is 0.
2. XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
3. XOR is commutative and associative.

For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.

Given the constraints that each number is between 1 and 4, we can represent these numbers in binary as:
- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

The XOR of the sequence will be zero if:
- The count of numbers with the least significant bit set (1, 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the second least significant bit set (2, 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the most significant bit set (4) is even.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all equal and odd. If they are, Bob can win once because removing one of each will make their counts even, leading to a zero XOR.
2. It then calculates the number of times Bob can win by pairing up numbers. Since each pair can be removed without affecting the XOR (as each pair contributes to an even count of each bit), it adds the floor division of each count by 2 to the result.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. For the input `1 1 1 0`:
   - Counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all 1 (odd and equal). Bob can win once by removing one of each.
   - The result is 1.

2. For the input `1 0 1 2`:
   - Counts of 1s and 3s are odd and equal. Bob can win once by removing one of each.
   - The result is 1.

3. For the input `2 2 2 0`:
   - We can pair up the 1s, 2s, and 3s, leading to 3 wins.
   - The result is 3.

4. For the input `3 3 2 0`:
   - We can pair up two 1s and two 3s, leading to 3 wins.
   - The result is 3.

5. For the input `0 9 9 9`:
   - We can pair up the 2s, 3s, and 4s, leading to 12 wins.
   - The result is 12.

The program correctly implements this logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
