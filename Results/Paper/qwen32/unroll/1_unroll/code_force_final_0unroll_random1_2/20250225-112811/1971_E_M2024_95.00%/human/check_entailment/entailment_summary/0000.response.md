### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, and then the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `a` and `b` with an additional `0` at the beginning to simplify indexing. It also creates `ad` and `bd` lists to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively. The `v` list is created to store the speeds between each pair of consecutive points.

3. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed `v[i]` between points `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`, where `ad[i]` is the distance between points `a[i-1]` and `a[i]`, and `bd[i]` is the time difference between points `b[i-1]` and `b[i]`.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the position `s` in `a` where `ql` would fit. If `ql` exactly matches an element in `a`, it directly outputs the corresponding time from `b`. Otherwise, it calculates the time required to reach `ql` by interpolating based on the speed between the points `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the time for each query on the same line, separated by spaces, and moves to a new line after processing all queries for a test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the time required for the car to reach each query point `d`, based on the provided `a` and `b` lists. It handles the interpolation correctly and efficiently uses `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment for each query.

**Correctness: True**
