### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to handle multiple test cases where a car travels from point 0 to point n on a number line, passing through k+1 known points (including 0 and n) at specific times. The program calculates the travel time for q queries, where each query asks for the time it takes to reach a specific point d on the number line.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the final destination), `k` (the number of known points), and `q` (the number of queries).
   - It then reads the list of known points `a` and the corresponding times `b` at which the car reaches these points. The lists `a` and `b` are augmented with a 0 at the beginning to simplify calculations.

2. **Distance and Time Differences:**
   - The program calculates the distances between consecutive known points (`ad` list) and the time differences between the corresponding arrival times (`bd` list).

3. **Speed Calculation:**
   - For each segment between two known points, the program calculates the speed `v` as the distance divided by the time.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in which the queried point `d` lies.
   - If `d` matches one of the known points, the program directly outputs the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the exact time to reach `d` based on the speed of the segment it lies in, adding the time already elapsed up to the start of the segment.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Handling of Known Points:** The program correctly identifies when a query point matches a known point and outputs the corresponding time.
- **Binary Search:** The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the relevant segment for each query.
- **Speed Calculation:** The speed for each segment is accurately calculated as the distance divided by the time.
- **Time Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the time to reach a point within a segment by using the speed of that segment and adding the time already elapsed up to the start of the segment.
- **Output Formatting:** The program outputs the results in the correct format, with each test case's results on a new line and each query's result separated by spaces.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
