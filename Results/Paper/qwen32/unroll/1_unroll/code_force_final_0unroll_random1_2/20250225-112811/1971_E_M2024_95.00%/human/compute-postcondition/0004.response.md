Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two sorted lists `a` and `b`, and a series of queries. For each query, it determines the corresponding value from list `b` either directly if the query matches an element in list `a`, or by linear interpolation based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`. The results of all queries for a test case are printed on a single line, separated by spaces.**
