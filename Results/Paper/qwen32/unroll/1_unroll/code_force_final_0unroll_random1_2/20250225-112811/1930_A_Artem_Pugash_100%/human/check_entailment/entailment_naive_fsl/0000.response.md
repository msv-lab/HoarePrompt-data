Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sorting the List**: The list of numbers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we iterate through the list in steps of 2, we are always picking the smallest available numbers first.

2. **Iterating and Summing**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first number of each pair to the score. Since the list is sorted, the first number of each pair is always the smaller one, which is the optimal choice to maximize the score.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by wrapping the logic in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

The program works correctly for all the provided examples and handles the constraints specified in the problem description. There is no apparent case where the program would not produce the correct maximum score based on the described strategy.
