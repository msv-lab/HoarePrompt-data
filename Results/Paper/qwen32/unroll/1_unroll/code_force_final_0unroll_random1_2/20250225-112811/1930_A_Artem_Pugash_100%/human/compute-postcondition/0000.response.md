In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable whose value is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute `t` times, and the value of `t` is directly obtained from the input.

The state before the loop starts includes:
- `t`: the number of test cases.
- For each test case, there is an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers.

However, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which does not need to be adjusted since it is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute `t` times based on the value of `t`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
