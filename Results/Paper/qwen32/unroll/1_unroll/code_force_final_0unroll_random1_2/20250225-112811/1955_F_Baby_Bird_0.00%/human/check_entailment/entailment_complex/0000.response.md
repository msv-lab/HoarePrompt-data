Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. 

#### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**:
    - XOR of any number with itself is 0.
    - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
    - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
    - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
    - Alice wins if the XOR is non-zero.

3. **Effect of Removing Numbers**:
    - Removing an even count of a number doesn't change the XOR.
    - Removing an odd count of a number flips the contribution of that number to the XOR.

4. **Strategy for Eve**:
    - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers' XOR is zero as often as possible.

5. **Count Analysis**:
    - If the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd, removing one of each will make their counts even, and the XOR can potentially be zero.
    - The presence of fours doesn't affect the XOR of ones, twos, and threes directly since 4 in binary is 100, and it doesn't affect the lower bits.
    - The total number of moves Eve can make is half the total count of numbers (since each move removes one number).

### Solution Analysis
The given solution attempts to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by:

1. **Adjusting Counts**:
    - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`:
        - This line adjusts the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours to be even.
        - However, this step is incorrect because it doesn't account for the initial odd counts which are crucial for determining Bob's wins.

2. **Calculating Result**:
    - `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)`:
        - This line checks if exactly three of the first three counts (ones, twos, threes) are odd.
        - If true, it adds 1 to the result.
        - It then adds half the sum of all four counts (which represents the total number of moves Eve can make).

### Correctness
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically:

- It incorrectly adjusts the counts to be even without considering the initial odd counts.
- The logic for checking if exactly three of the first three counts are odd and adding 1 to the result is flawed and doesn't account for all scenarios where Bob can win.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
