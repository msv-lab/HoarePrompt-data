You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11

Output

    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of colored cells required to ensure that at least `k` diagonals of an `n x n` square grid contain at least one colored cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the given program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program provided seems to have an incorrect logic for calculating the number of cells to color.

Here is the provided program:
```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Let's consider the logic in the code:
1. If \( k == 1 \), it correctly prints 1 because only one diagonal needs a colored cell.
2. For other cases, it uses a condition `if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2))`:
   - Simplifying the condition: `2 * (n + (n - 2)) = 2 * (2n - 2) = 4n - 4`.
   - So, the condition becomes `if k <= 4n - 4`.
3. If the condition is true, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
4. If the condition is false, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.

However, this logic is flawed. Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate why:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
3 10
```
Expected Output:
```
6
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For \( n = 3 \), there are \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals.
- To cover all 10 diagonals, we need to color at least 6 cells. This is because we can cover 3 diagonals with one cell (the center cell), and then we need to cover the remaining 7 diagonals with 3 more cells (one for each of the 3 rows and 3 columns minus the center cell which is already covered).

However, the program will output:
- `k = 10`, which is not less than `4n - 4 = 8`, so it will use the else clause.
- The output will be `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.

While the output for this specific case happens to be correct, let's consider another case:

**Another Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
4 7
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For \( n = 4 \), there are \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \) diagonals.
- To cover 7 diagonals, we can color 4 cells in such a way that they cover 7 diagonals.

However, the program will output:
- `k = 7`, which is less than `4n - 4 = 12`, so it will use the if clause.
- The output will be `math.ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.

While the output for this specific case happens to be correct, let's consider a more critical case:

**Critical Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
5 12
```
Expected Output:
```
6
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For \( n = 5 \), there are \( 4 \times 5 - 2 = 18 \) diagonals.
- To cover 12 diagonals, we need to color at least 6 cells.

However, the program will output:
- `k = 12`, which is less than `4n - 4 = 16`, so it will use the if clause.
- The output will be `math.ceil(12 / 2) = 6`.

While the output for this specific case happens to be correct, let's consider a case where the program will fail:

**Failure Case:**
Input:
```
1
5 15
```
Expected Output:
```
8
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For \( n = 5 \), there are \( 4 \times 5 - 2 = 18 \) diagonals.
- To cover 15 diagonals, we need to color at least 8 cells.

However, the program will output:
- `k = 15`, which is less than `4n - 4 = 16`, so it will use the if clause.
- The output will be `math.ceil(15 / 2) = 8`.

While the output for this specific case happens to be correct, let's consider a more critical case:

**Failure Case:**
Input:
```
1
5 16
```
Expected Output:
```
9
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For \( n = 5 \), there are \( 4 \times 5 - 2 = 18 \) diagonals.
- To cover 16 diagonals, we need to color at least 9 cells.

However, the program will output:
- `k = 16`, which is not less than `4n - 4 = 16`, so it will use the else clause.
- The output will be `16 // 2 + 1 = 9`.

While the output for this specific case happens to be correct, let's consider a more critical case:

**Failure Case:**
Input:
```
1
5 17
```
Expected Output:
```
9
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- For \( n = 5 \), there are \( 4 \times 5 - 2 = 18 \) diagonals.
- To cover 17 diagonals, we need to color at least 9 cells.

However, the program will output:
- `k = 17`, which is not less than `4n - 4 = 16`, so it will use the else clause.
- The output will be `17 // 2 + 1 = 9`.

While the output for this specific case happens to be correct, the logic in the program is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Thus, the final answer is:
Correctness: **False**.
