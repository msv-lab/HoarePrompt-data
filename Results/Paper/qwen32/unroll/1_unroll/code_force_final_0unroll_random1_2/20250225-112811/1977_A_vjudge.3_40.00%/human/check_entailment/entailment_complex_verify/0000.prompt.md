You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: A series of 'Yes' or 'No' messages printed for each iteration based on the input pairs (n, m).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it prints 'Yes' if certain conditions are met (either `n` equals `m`, `m` is exactly one less than `n`, or both `m` and `n` are either even or odd), and 'No' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in one move. Given `n` moves and a desired number of cubes `m`, determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Evaluation:
1. **Case `n == m`:** 
   - If `n` moves are made and `m` cubes are desired, and `n == m`, then it is possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding one cube per move.
   - This case is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Case `m > n`:**
   - If `m` cubes are desired and `m > n`, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, and he can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - This case is correctly handled by the program.

3. **Case `m == n - 1`:**
   - If `m` cubes are desired and `m == n - 1`, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding `m` cubes and then removing one cube.
   - This case is correctly handled by the program.

4. **Case `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition is not a valid check for the problem. Just because both `m` and `n` are even does not guarantee that it is possible to end up with `m` cubes.
   - This case is incorrectly handled by the program.

5. **Case `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:**
   - Similarly, this condition is not a valid check for the problem. Just because both `m` and `n` are odd does not guarantee that it is possible to end up with `m` cubes.
   - This case is incorrectly handled by the program.

6. **Remaining Cases:**
   - The remaining `else` case incorrectly handles scenarios where the above conditions do not apply.

### Correctness Check:
The provided program incorrectly handles several cases. Specifically, the conditions `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` are not valid checks for the problem requirements.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:
- **Input:** `n = 4, m = 3`
- **Expected Output:** `Yes` (Nikita can add 3 cubes and then remove 1 cube)
- **Actual Output:** `No` (because `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 == 0`)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
