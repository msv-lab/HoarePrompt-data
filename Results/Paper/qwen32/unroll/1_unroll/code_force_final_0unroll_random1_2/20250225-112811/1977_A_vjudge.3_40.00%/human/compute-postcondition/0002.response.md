To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior based on the input values provided during each iteration. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and then prints a message based on specific conditions.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. If `n == m`, print 'Yes'.
2. If `m > n`, print 'No'.
3. If `m == n - 1`, print 'Yes'.
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, print 'Yes'.
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, print 'Yes'.
6. Otherwise, print 'No'.

The loop does not modify the value of `t` or any other variables outside the loop. It only processes the input pairs `(n, m)` and prints a corresponding message for each pair. Therefore, the output state is determined by the printed messages, which are dependent on the input values.

Since the loop does not change the initial state of `t` and does not modify any other variables outside the loop, the only change is in the printed output. The output state will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' messages printed for each iteration based on the input pairs.

Output State: **A series of 'Yes' or 'No' messages printed for each iteration based on the input pairs (n, m).**
