### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. The solution provided in the annotated program attempts to determine the answer based on several conditions. Let's analyze these conditions:

1. **Condition: `if n == m:`**
   - This checks if the number of moves (`n`) is equal to the number of cubes (`m`). If they are equal, it means that Nikita can simply add one cube per move and end up with `m` cubes. This is correct.

2. **Condition: `elif m > n:`**
   - If `m` (the desired number of cubes) is greater than `n` (the number of moves), it is impossible to have more cubes than moves because each move can only add or remove one cube. This is correct.

3. **Condition: `elif m == n - 1:`**
   - If `m` is one less than `n`, it means Nikita can add a cube `n-1` times and remove one cube once, ending up with `m` cubes. This is correct.

4. **Condition: `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`**
   - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. For even `m` and `n`, it is possible to reach `m` cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes. This is correct.

5. **Condition: `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`**
   - This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. For odd `m` and `n`, it is also possible to reach `m` cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes. This is correct.

6. **Condition: `else: print('No')`**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "No". This condition handles all other cases where it is not possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

However, the conditions `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are redundant. The key insight is that as long as `n` is at least `m` and the parity (evenness or oddness) of `n` matches the parity of `m`, it is possible to reach `m` cubes. Therefore, the conditions can be simplified to:

- If `n >= m` and `n % 2 == m % 2`, print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

The provided program does not follow this simplified logic, but it does cover all necessary cases correctly. Thus, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
