Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in one move. Given `n` moves and a desired number of cubes `m`, determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Evaluation:
1. **Case `n == m`:** 
   - If `n` moves are made and `m` cubes are desired, and `n == m`, then it is possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding one cube per move.
   - This case is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Case `m > n`:**
   - If `m` cubes are desired and `m > n`, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, and he can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - This case is correctly handled by the program.

3. **Case `m == n - 1`:**
   - If `m` cubes are desired and `m == n - 1`, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding `m` cubes and then removing one cube.
   - This case is correctly handled by the program.

4. **Case `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition is not a valid check for the problem. Just because both `m` and `n` are even does not guarantee that it is possible to end up with `m` cubes.
   - This case is incorrectly handled by the program.

5. **Case `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:**
   - Similarly, this condition is not a valid check for the problem. Just because both `m` and `n` are odd does not guarantee that it is possible to end up with `m` cubes.
   - This case is incorrectly handled by the program.

6. **Remaining Cases:**
   - The remaining `else` case incorrectly handles scenarios where the above conditions do not apply.

### Correctness Check:
The provided program incorrectly handles several cases. Specifically, the conditions `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` are not valid checks for the problem requirements.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:
- **Input:** `n = 4, m = 3`
- **Expected Output:** `Yes` (Nikita can add 3 cubes and then remove 1 cube)
- **Actual Output:** `No` (because `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 == 0`)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
