Correctness: **False**

The issue with the provided program is that the function `func_1` is defined after it is called in the `print(func_1(s))` statement. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. To fix this, you should move the definition of `func_1` above the line where it is called. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result

s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))
```

With this change, the program should work correctly.
