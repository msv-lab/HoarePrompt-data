Let's walk through the program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a single line of input which is stored in the variable `s`. This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Calculating Prefix Balances:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples containing the prefix balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
   - It also initializes a variable `balance` to keep track of the running balance of the parentheses sequence.
   - As it iterates over each character in the input string `s`, it appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to the `prefix_balance` list. Here, `balance` is the balance before the current character, `i` is the position of the character, and `s[i]` is the character itself.
   - Depending on whether the current character is an opening parenthesis `(` or a closing parenthesis `)`, the balance is incremented or decremented, respectively.

3. **Sorting the Prefix Balances:**
   - The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom sorting key. The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, which means that the list is primarily sorted by the prefix balance in ascending order, and secondarily by the position in descending order (to break ties).

4. **Generating the Result:**
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
   - It uses a list comprehension `[x[2] for x in prefix_balance]` to extract the characters from the sorted list of tuples, and then joins them into a single string using `''.join()`.

5. **Output:**
   - The resulting string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence, is returned by the function `func_1` and printed.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

- **Prefix Balance Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
- **Sorting Logic:** The sorting logic matches the problem statement's requirement of sorting by prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order to break ties.
- **Result Construction:** The program correctly constructs the result string by extracting and joining the characters from the sorted list of tuples.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
