### Reasoning

Let's systematically analyze the provided Python program to ensure it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a single line of input and strips any whitespace, storing the result in the variable `s`. This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Calculating Prefix Balances:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, i, s[i])`, where `balance` is the prefix balance before the character at position `i`, `i` is the position of the character, and `s[i]` is the character itself.
   - It initializes `balance` to 0 and iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to `prefix_balance`.
   - It then updates the `balance` by incrementing it if the character is `(` and decrementing it if the character is `)`.

3. **Sorting the Prefix Balances:**
   - The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a lambda function as the key. The key `(x[0], -x[1])` ensures that the list is sorted first by prefix balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order to break ties. This matches the problem statement's requirement for sorting.

4. **Generating the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
   - It uses a list comprehension `[x[2] for x in prefix_balance]` to extract the characters from the sorted list of tuples and joins them into a single string using `''.join()`.

5. **Output:**
   - The resulting string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence, is returned by the function `func_1` and printed.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

- **Prefix Balance Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
- **Sorting Logic:** The sorting logic matches the problem statement's requirement of sorting by prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order to break ties.
- **Result Construction:** The program correctly constructs the result string by extracting and joining the characters from the sorted list of tuples.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate and the program is indeed correct.

**Final: True**
