### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order and constructing the permutation `p` based on the MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the approach and its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a reasonable starting point because the MEX of an empty set is `0`, and the MEX of a set containing all integers from `0` to `n-1` is `n`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` from the last element to the first. This is a valid approach because it allows the program to determine the MEX value at each step by considering the elements that have not yet been placed in `p`.

3. **Constructing `p`**:
   - For each element `a[i]` in the array `a`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. This is based on the given relation \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), which can be rearranged to \( p_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \).
   - After calculating `res[i]`, it updates `mex` to the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - a[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been placed in `p`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**: The logic of the program is correct based on the problem description. By iterating in reverse and using the MEX value, the program ensures that each element of `p` is correctly placed according to the given constraints.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `a_i` can be negative or positive, and `mex` is updated appropriately to maintain the correct MEX value at each step.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
