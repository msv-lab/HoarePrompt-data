Reasoning: The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating over the array `a` in reverse order and calculating the permutation `p` based on the given formula `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`. However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX value at each step. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation `p` being constructed. The code incorrectly assumes that `mex` can be updated by simply taking the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]`.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the issues:

1. The code initializes `mex` to `n`, which is correct initially because the MEX of an empty list is `0`, and `n` is an upper bound that will be decremented down to the correct MEX value.
2. The core logic of the code is in the loop where it sets `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that `res[i]` is a valid MEX value for the current prefix of `p`.
3. The code then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. This is incorrect because `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of `p`, not simply a decremented value based on `ar[i]`.

To fix the code, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and compute the MEX value correctly at each step by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set of used numbers.

Given the issues in the provided code, it is clear that the program does not correctly compute the permutation `p` for the given `a`.

Correctness: **False**
