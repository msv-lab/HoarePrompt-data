You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

    #State: For each test case, a list `res` of n integers is printed where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` starting from the end of the list `ar` to the beginning. The variable `mex` is initially set to `n` and is updated to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the iteration. The state of `t`, `n`, and `ar` from the initial state remains unchanged except that `ar` is processed to produce `res`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that, for each index `i` from `1` to `n`, the array `a` is defined as:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
where \(\texttt{MEX}\) is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to construct the permutation `p` in reverse order. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values of length `n` to store the resulting permutation.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is an upper bound for the MEX value.

2. **Reverse Construction**:
   - The solution iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as:
     \[ \text{res}[i] = \text{mex} - \text{ar}[i] \]
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `res[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The resulting permutation `res` is printed for each test case.

### Issues in the Solution:
The reverse construction approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the MEX values will be correctly maintained. Specifically:

- The `mex` variable is updated based on the current `res[i]` value, which might not reflect the true MEX of the constructed prefix of `p` up to that point.
- The MEX value should be dynamically recalculated based on the elements already placed in `res` up to the current index, not just based on the previous `mex` and the current `ar[i]`.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of available numbers (those not yet used in `p`) and updating it as we construct `p`. Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a set `available` initialized with numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Initialize an empty list `res` to store the resulting permutation.

2. **Forward Construction**:
   - For each element `ar[i]` in the array `ar`, calculate the MEX value from the `available` set.
   - Determine `p[i]` as:
     \[ p[i] = \text{MEX} - \text{ar}[i] \]
   - Remove `p[i]` from the `available` set.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the resulting permutation `res` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided solution, it is not guaranteed to produce a correct permutation `p` for the given array `a`. Therefore, the correctness of the solution is:

Correctness: **False**
