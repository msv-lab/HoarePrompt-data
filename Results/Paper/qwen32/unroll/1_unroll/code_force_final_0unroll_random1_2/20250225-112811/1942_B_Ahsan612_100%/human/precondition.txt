t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list a of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data in each test case.
