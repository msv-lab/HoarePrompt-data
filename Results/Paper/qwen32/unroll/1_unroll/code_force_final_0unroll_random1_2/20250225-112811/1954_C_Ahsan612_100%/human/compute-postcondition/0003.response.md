Functionality: **For each of the t test cases, the function takes two integers `x` and `y` consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and outputs two numbers: the first number is constructed by taking the maximum digit at each position until the first difference, then taking the minimum digit for all subsequent positions; the second number is constructed by taking the minimum digit at each position until the first difference, then taking the maximum digit for all subsequent positions.**
