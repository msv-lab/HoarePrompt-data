Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully implement the solution to the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be related to modular arithmetic, specifically calculating modular inverses, which can be useful for modular division. However, the main logic for solving the problem is missing.

The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums, which is a more complex combinatorial problem. The solution would likely involve dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics to count the valid permutations based on the given constraints.

To solve this problem, one would need to:
1. Parse the input for each test case.
2. Use the prefix and suffix maximum indices to determine the constraints on the permutation.
3. Use combinatorial methods or dynamic programming to count the number of valid permutations that satisfy these constraints.
4. Output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided code does not address these steps, so it cannot be considered a correct solution to the problem.
