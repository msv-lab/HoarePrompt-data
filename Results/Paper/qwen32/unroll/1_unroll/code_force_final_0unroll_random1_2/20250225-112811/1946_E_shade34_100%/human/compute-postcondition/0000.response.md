Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `c` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, `d` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**

Natural language explanation: The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is called with `b` and `1000000007` as arguments, and it returns a tuple. The first element of this tuple is assigned to `c`, and the second element is assigned to `d`.
