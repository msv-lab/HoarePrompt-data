Output State: **The program returns (1, -(a // b - 1)) where 'a' is an integer greater than or equal to 'b', and 'b' is a non-zero integer that divides 'a' without a remainder.**

To elaborate:
- The first value returned is always `1`.
- The second value returned is `-(a // b - 1)`, where `a // b` represents the integer division of `a` by `b`. Since `a` is divisible by `b`, `a // b` is an integer representing how many times `b` fits into `a`. Subtracting `1` from this result and negating it gives the second value returned.
