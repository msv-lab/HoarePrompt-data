You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are integers, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values `d` and `c` which are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)` in that order.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns (1, -(a // b - 1)) where 'a' is an integer greater than or equal to 'b', and 'b' is a non-zero integer that divides 'a' without a remainder.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It returns a tuple based on the following conditions: Case_1: If `a` and `b` are such that the function's logic leads to this case, it returns the tuple (1, 0). Case_2: If the function's logic leads to this case, it returns the values `d` and `c` in that order, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`. Case_3: If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is a non-zero integer that divides `a` without a remainder, it returns the tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)). Case_4: If the function's logic leads to this case, it returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the tuple (1, 0)

Case_2: The program returns the values `d` and `c` which are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)` in that order.

Case_3: The program returns (1, -(a // b - 1)) where 'a' is an integer greater than or equal to 'b', and 'b' is a non-zero integer that divides 'a' without a remainder.

Case_4: The program returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
