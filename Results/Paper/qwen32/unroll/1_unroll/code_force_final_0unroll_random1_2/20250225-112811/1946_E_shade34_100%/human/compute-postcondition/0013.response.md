Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns a tuple of two integers. The returned tuple depends on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0)`. If `a` is less than `b`, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a` swapped and returns the swapped result. If `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple derived from the result of that call.**
