a is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), an integer m1 (1 ≤ m1 ≤ n), an integer m2 (1 ≤ m2 ≤ n), a list p of m1 integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and a list s of m2 integers (1 ≤ s_i ≤ n). The list p contains the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and the list s contains the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. b is not used in the function definition and seems to be a placeholder.
