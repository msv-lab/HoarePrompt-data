### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy specific conditions regarding their prefix and suffix maximums. The given Python program calculates this number using combinatorial methods, specifically by computing binomial coefficients modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's break down the program:

1. **Precomputing Factorials**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to \(2 \times 10^5\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for efficiently computing binomial coefficients later.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.

3. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, if the first prefix maximum index is 1, and if the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the program outputs 0 because such a permutation is impossible.

4. **Calculating the Number of Permutations**:
   - The program calculates the number of suitable permutations by multiplying binomial coefficients. This is done in two main steps:
     - First, it calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the suffix maximums.
     - Second, it calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the prefix maximums.
   - The program also multiplies by the factorials of the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums to account for the permutations within these gaps.

5. **Using Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1` implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the modular multiplicative inverse, which is used in calculating binomial coefficients.
   - `func_2` computes the modular inverse of a number and multiplies it by another number, both modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of Factorial Precomputation**:
  - The precomputation of factorials is correct and efficient. The program uses modular arithmetic to prevent overflow.

- **Validation Logic**:
  - The validation logic is correct. If the first prefix maximum is not 1, the last suffix maximum is not `n`, or the last prefix maximum is not the same as the first suffix maximum, no valid permutation exists.

- **Combinatorial Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the number of permutations using binomial coefficients. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result is within the required bounds.

- **Helper Functions**:
  - `func_1` correctly computes the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
  - `func_2` correctly computes the modular inverse of a number and multiplies it by another number, both modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. It handles all edge cases and uses efficient combinatorial methods.

**Correctness: True**
