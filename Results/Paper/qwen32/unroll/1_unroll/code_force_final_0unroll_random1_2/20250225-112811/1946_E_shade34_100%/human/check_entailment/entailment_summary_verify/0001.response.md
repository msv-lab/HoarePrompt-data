### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not address the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed related to modular arithmetic, specifically for computing modular inverses, which can be useful in combinatorial problems involving modular arithmetic. However, these functions alone do not solve the problem at hand.

The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific indices for their prefix and suffix maximums. This involves combinatorial logic and careful consideration of the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums. The provided code does not include any logic to handle the input arrays `p` and `s` (indices of prefix and suffix maximums) and compute the number of valid permutations.

### Conclusion:

Given that the provided code does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect for the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
