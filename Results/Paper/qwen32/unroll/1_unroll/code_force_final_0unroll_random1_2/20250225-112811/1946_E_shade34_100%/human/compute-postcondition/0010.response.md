To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `a` and `b` are integers
- `b` is not equal to 0
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`
- `a` is not divisible by `b`

The code snippet:
```
c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1` with two arguments: `b` and `a % b`. The function returns two values which are assigned to `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we will assume it performs some operation and returns two values based on its implementation.

Given the constraints and the operation `a % b`, we know that `a % b` will be the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`, which is a non-negative integer less than `b`.

Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the values returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `b` is not equal to 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`**.
