### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a binary string can be cut into such that rearranging these pieces results in a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The given program follows a logical approach to solve this problem:
1. It counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (`cut0`) in the string.
2. If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it means the string is already sorted or consists entirely of '1's or '0's. In this case, the number of pieces required is `cut1 + 1`. The `+1` accounts for the entire string being considered as a single piece if there are no '1's to '0's transitions.
3. If there are transitions from '0' to '1', the number of pieces required is `cut0 + cut1`. Each transition from '0' to '1' indicates a potential point where the string needs to be cut to ensure the '0's can be moved before the '1's.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:
- For `11010`, transitions are `cut1 = 2` (from '1' to '0' at positions 1 and 3) and `cut0 = 1` (from '0' to '1' at position 2). The number of pieces required is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.
- For `00000000`, there are no transitions, so `cut1 = 0` and `cut0 = 0`. The number of pieces required is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
- For `1`, there are no transitions, so `cut1 = 0` and `cut0 = 0`. The number of pieces required is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
- For `10`, there is one transition from '1' to '0' (`cut1 = 1`) and no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 = 0`). The number of pieces required is `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- For `0001111`, there are no transitions, so `cut1 = 0` and `cut0 = 0`. The number of pieces required is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
- For `0110`, there is one transition from '0' to '1' (`cut0 = 1`) and one transition from '1' to '0' (`cut1 = 1`). The number of pieces required is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

The program correctly calculates the number of pieces required for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
