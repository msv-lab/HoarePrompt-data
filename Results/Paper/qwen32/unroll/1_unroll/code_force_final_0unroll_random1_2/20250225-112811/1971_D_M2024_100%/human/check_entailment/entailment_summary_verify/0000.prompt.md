You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' and between '1' and '0' in the string. If there are no '0' to '1' transitions, it adds 1 to the count of '1' to '0' transitions before printing the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a binary string, determine the minimum number of pieces needed to cut it into, such that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
- A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.
- Each piece must be a contiguous substring.
- All pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it processes the binary string to determine the minimum number of cuts needed.

Here is the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
```

### Logic Explanation:
- The program counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (`cut0`).
- If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it means the string is already sorted or starts with '1' and ends with '0', so it prints `cut1 + 1` (which would be 1 if there are no '1's or 0 if there are no '1's to '0's transitions).
- Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`, which accounts for all necessary cuts.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The transition counts (`cut0` and `cut1`) capture the points where the string changes from '0' to '1' and vice versa.
- The minimum number of cuts required is indeed the sum of these transitions (`cut0 + cut1`), as each transition point indicates a necessary cut to separate the segments that need to be rearranged.
- If there are no '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), the string is already sorted or can be made sorted by a single piece, hence `cut1 + 1` (since `cut1` would be 0 if the string is already sorted).

### Test Cases Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0` (2 times), `0->1` (2 times)
   - Output: `2 + 2 = 4` (Incorrect, should be 3)
2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - Transitions: `0->1` (0 times), `1->0` (0 times)
   - Output: `0 + 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
3. **Input:** `1`
   - Transitions: `0->1` (0 times), `1->0` (0 times)
   - Output: `0 + 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transitions: `1->0` (1 time), `0->1` (0 times)
   - Output: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)
5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - Transitions: `0->1` (1 time), `1->0` (0 times)
   - Output: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (Incorrect, should be 1)
6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions: `0->1` (1 time), `1->0` (1 time)
   - Output: `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where there are no '0' to '1' transitions but there are multiple '1' to '0' transitions. For example, in the input `11010`, the correct output should be 3, but the program outputs 4. Similarly, for `0001111`, the correct output should be 1, but the program outputs 2.

**Correctness:** **False**

### Explanation of the Failure:
The logic `if cut0 == 0: print(cut1 + 1)` is incorrect because it assumes that if there are no '0' to '1' transitions, the string is either already sorted or can be sorted with a single piece. However, when there are multiple '1' to '0' transitions, additional pieces are needed to separate the segments correctly. The correct approach should be to simply print `cut0 + cut1` for all cases.
