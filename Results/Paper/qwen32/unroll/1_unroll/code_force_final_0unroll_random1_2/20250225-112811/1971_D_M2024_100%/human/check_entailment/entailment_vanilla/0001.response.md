Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string can be cut into, such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorted Binary String**: The final sorted string will have all '0's followed by all '1's.
2. **Transitions**: To achieve this, we need to identify the transitions from '1' to '0' and '0' to '1' in the string.
3. **Minimum Cuts**: The number of cuts needed is related to the number of transitions. Specifically:
   - A transition from '1' to '0' indicates that a cut is necessary to separate the '1's from the '0's.
   - A transition from '0' to '1' also indicates a cut, as this is where the '0's end and '1's begin.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no transitions ('000...' or '111...'), then only one piece is needed.
   - If there are transitions, the number of cuts required is the sum of the transitions plus one (to account for the initial segment).

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: `cut0` and `cut1` are initialized to zero. `cut0` counts transitions from '0' to '1', and `cut1` counts transitions from '1' to '0'.
2. **Transition Counting**: The program iterates through the string and increments `cut0` and `cut1` based on the transitions.
3. **Output Logic**:
   - If `cut0` is zero (no '0' to '1' transitions), it means the string starts with '0's and ends with '1's. In this case, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If `cut0` is not zero, it means there are both '0' to '1' and '1' to '0' transitions. The number of pieces needed is the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Test Case 1**: "11010"
  - Transitions: '1' to '0' (cut1 = 2), '0' to '1' (cut0 = 1)
  - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3` (Correct)
- **Test Case 2**: "00000000"
  - Transitions: None
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
- **Test Case 3**: "1"
  - Transitions: None
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
- **Test Case 4**: "10"
  - Transitions: '1' to '0' (cut1 = 1)
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)
- **Test Case 5**: "0001111"
  - Transitions: None
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
- **Test Case 6**: "0110"
  - Transitions: '0' to '1' (cut0 = 1), '1' to '0' (cut1 = 1)
  - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly counts the necessary transitions and calculates the minimum number of pieces required for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
