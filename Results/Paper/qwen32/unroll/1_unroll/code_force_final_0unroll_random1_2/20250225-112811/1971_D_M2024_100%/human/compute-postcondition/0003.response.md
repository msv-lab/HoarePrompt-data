The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `s`, which is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500 for each test case.

The function processes these test cases and returns the following based on the string `s` for each test case:
- Case_1: If the string `s` contains only '0's, the function returns "All zeros".
- Case_2: If the string `s` contains only '1's, the function returns "All ones".
- Case_3: If the string `s` contains a mix of '0's and '1's, the function returns "Mixed".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a string `s` for each test case consisting of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it returns "All zeros" if `s` contains only '0's, "All ones" if `s` contains only '1's, and "Mixed" if `s` contains a mix of '0's and '1's.**
