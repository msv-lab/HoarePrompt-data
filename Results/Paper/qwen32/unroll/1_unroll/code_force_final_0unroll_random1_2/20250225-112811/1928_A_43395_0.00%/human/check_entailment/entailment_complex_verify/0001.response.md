### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob can cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then try to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The key points to consider:
1. If `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is not a 90° rotation of the original.
2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts will result in two rectangles of size `a x 1` and `b x 1` (or `1 x a` and `1 x b`), and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle other than a 90° rotation of the original.

#### Program Analysis:
The code provided is:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

Annotations provided:
1. **First Condition**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` 
   - This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If true, it prints "yes". This is correct based on the problem analysis.
2. **Second Condition**: `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`
   - This condition is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense. It evaluates to a tuple and does not serve the intended purpose.
3. **Third Condition**: `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`
   - This condition checks if the difference `a - b` is non-zero, which is always true for any non-zero `a` and `b`. This condition is not meaningful for determining the solution.
4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('no')`
   - This condition handles the case when both `a` and `b` are odd. However, it does not account for the case where one of `a` or `b` is even.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The first condition (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`) is correct.
- The second condition is syntactically incorrect and logically irrelevant.
- The third condition is always true for non-zero differences and does not provide meaningful information.
- The else condition is incorrect as it does not handle cases where one of `a` or `b` is even.

#### Correct Approach:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, print "yes".
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "no".

#### Revised Code:
A correct version of the program would be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program. The program is incorrect due to the syntactically incorrect and logically irrelevant condition, the always true condition, and the incorrect handling of the else case.

**Final:** **False**
