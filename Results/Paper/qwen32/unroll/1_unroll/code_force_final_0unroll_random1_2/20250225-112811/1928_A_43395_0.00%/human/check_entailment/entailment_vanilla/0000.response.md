Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob can cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then try to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The key points to consider:
1. If `a x b` can be cut into two rectangles and these two rectangles can form a new rectangle that is not a 90° rotation of the original, then the answer is "Yes".
2. Otherwise, the answer is "No".

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
1. If `a` or `b` is even, then Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle. This is because he can cut along the longer side if it is even, and the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then the only possible cuts will result in two rectangles of size `a x 1` and `b x 1` (or `1 x a` and `1 x b`), and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle other than a 90° rotation of the original.

### Analyzing the Program:
Let's examine the logic in the provided code:
1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If so, it prints "yes" (which is correct based on the problem analysis).
4. It then has a condition that checks `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`, which is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense in the context of the problem.
5. The next condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true for any non-zero `a` and `b` because the difference `a - b` can never be both greater than 0 and less than 0 simultaneously. This condition is not meaningful for determining the solution.
6. The `else` block prints "no", which is not always correct, as it does not account for the case where `a` or `b` is even.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect due to the following reasons:
- The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is syntactically incorrect and logically irrelevant.
- The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true for non-zero differences, which is not helpful.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where one of `a` or `b` is even.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, print "yes".
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "no".

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
