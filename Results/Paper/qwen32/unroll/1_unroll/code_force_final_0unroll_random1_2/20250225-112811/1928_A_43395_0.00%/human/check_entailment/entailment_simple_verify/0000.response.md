### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Recap
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, he needs to check if he can form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints "yes".
   - If the condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is true, it prints "no".
   - If `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`, it prints "yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "no".

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense. The tuple `(a - b == -a, a)` will always evaluate to `(False, a)` or `(True, a)` because `a - b == -a` is false unless `a` is `0` (which is not possible as per the problem constraints). Similarly, `(b - a == -b, b)` will always evaluate to `(False, b)` or `(True, b)`.
   - This condition will never correctly determine if a rectangle can be formed.

2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition is true for all non-zero values of `a - b`. This means it will return "yes" for all cases where `a` is not equal to `b`, which is incorrect.
   - For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 2`, the program incorrectly prints "yes" because `(2 - 2) % 2` is `0`, but the `or` condition will still evaluate to `True` for non-zero differences.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case when `a` is equal to `b`. According to the problem, if `a` equals `b`, it is impossible to form a new rectangle, so the correct output should be "no".
   - For all other cases where `a` is not equal to `b`, the program should print "yes". However, the current logic incorrectly handles these cases due to the flawed conditions.

#### Correct Logic
The correct logic should be:
- If `a` is equal to `b`, it is impossible to form a new rectangle, so print "no".
- If `a` is not equal to `b`, it is always possible to form a new rectangle, so print "yes".

#### Correct Program
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

#### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. There are multiple test cases where the program will give incorrect results.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
