The code snippet provided initializes a variable `start` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `arr` or `nums`, which remain as specified in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of the variable `start` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n, and the length of `arr` is `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of each integer in `arr`; `start` is 0.**
