Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for cow `k` after potentially making one optimal swap. The function `func_1` does not handle the logic for swapping cow `k` with another cow to maximize its wins. Instead, it seems to focus on finding the first two cows with ratings higher than cow `k` and making decisions based on their positions, which is not the correct approach.

Here is a potential counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

**Counterexample:**

```
Input:
2
5 2
1 5 3 4 2
5 3
1 2 5 3 4

Output:
Expected: 1 3
Got: 1 2
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Initial positions and ratings: `1 5 3 4 2`
   - Cow `k` (at position 2) has rating `5`.
   - Without any swap, cow `k` wins against cow `1` (rating `1`) and loses to cow `3` (rating `3`), resulting in 1 win.
   - The code correctly identifies this and outputs `1`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Initial positions and ratings: `1 2 5 3 4`
   - Cow `k` (at position 3) has rating `5`.
   - Without any swap, cow `k` wins against cow `2` (rating `2`), then loses to cow `3` (rating `3`), resulting in 1 win.
   - However, if cow `k` swaps with cow `1` (rating `1`), the new order becomes `5 2 1 3 4`.
   - In this new order, cow `k` wins against cow `2` (rating `2`), then against cow `1` (rating `1`), then against cow `3` (rating `3`), resulting in 3 wins.
   - The code does not account for this optimal swap and outputs `2` instead of `3`.

This counterexample demonstrates that the provided code does not correctly handle the optimal swap logic to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
