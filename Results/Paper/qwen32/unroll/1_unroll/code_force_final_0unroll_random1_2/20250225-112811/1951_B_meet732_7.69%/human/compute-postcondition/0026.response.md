Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**

In simpler terms, the output is the larger of two calculated values: the number of cows before the cow at index `ind[0]` (which is `ind[0] - 1`), and the number of cows between your cow at index `k` and the cow at index `ind[0]` (which is `k - ind[0]`).
