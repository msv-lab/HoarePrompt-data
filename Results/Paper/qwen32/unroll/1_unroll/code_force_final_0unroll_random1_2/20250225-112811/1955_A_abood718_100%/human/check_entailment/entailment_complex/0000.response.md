### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - The program uses the following logic to determine the minimum cost:
     - If the cost of two yogurts bought individually (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`), it means buying individually is cheaper. Hence, the program calculates the total cost as `n * a`.
     - If the number of yogurts `n` is even, the program calculates the total cost as `(n / 2) * b` because all yogurts can be bought in pairs at the promotional price.
     - If the number of yogurts `n` is odd, the program calculates the total cost as `(n // 2) * b + a`. This means buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Verification Against Example:**
   - **First Test Case (n=2, a=5, b=9):**
     - Since `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`, the cost is `b = 9`.
   - **Second Test Case (n=3, a=5, b=9):**
     - Since `n` is odd, the cost is `(3 // 2) * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Third Test Case (n=3, a=5, b=11):**
     - Since `n` is odd, the cost is `(3 // 2) * b + a = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16`. However, the problem states that buying three yogurts individually at `3 * 5 = 15` is cheaper. The program does not handle this case correctly as it should compare `n * a` with `(n // 2) * b + a` for odd `n`.
   - **Fourth Test Case (n=4, a=5, b=11):**
     - Since `n` is even, the cost is `(4 / 2) * b = 2 * 11 = 22`. However, the problem states that buying four yogurts individually at `4 * 5 = 20` is cheaper. The program does not handle this case correctly as it should compare `n * a` with `(n // 2) * b` for even `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where buying individually is cheaper than using the promotion, especially when `n` is odd or even. The logic needs to be adjusted to always compare the total cost of buying individually (`n * a`) with the cost of buying in pairs plus the remaining single yogurt if `n` is odd (`(n // 2) * b + a`).

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum cost in all scenarios as per the problem description.
