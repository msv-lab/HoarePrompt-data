Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap

- **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Conditions:**
  - Price of one yogurt: `a` burles.
  - Price of two yogurts during promotion: `b` burles.
- **Logic:**
  - If `2 * a < b`, buy each yogurt individually.
  - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
  - If `n` is odd, buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

### Program Code Analysis

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Function Summary Recap

- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**
   - This condition checks if buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them during the promotion (`b`).
   - If true, the program correctly calculates the total cost as `A * B` (which should be `n * a`).

2. **Case 2: `A % 2 == 0`**
   - This condition checks if the number of yogurts `n` is even.
   - If true, the program calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)` (which should be `(n / 2) * b`).
   - The use of `int()` here is redundant since `A * C / 2` will already be an integer if `A` is even.

3. **Case 3: `A % 2 != 0`**
   - This condition handles the case where the number of yogurts `n` is odd.
   - The program calculates the total cost as `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`.
   - This translates to `((n // 2) * b) + a`, which is correct.

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 9`, the cost should be `2 * 5 = 10`. However, the correct cost is `9` (buying 2 yogurts at promotion price).
  - **Issue:** The condition `B * 2 < C` should be `B < C` to correctly handle this case.

- **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `3 % 2 != 0`, the cost should be `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - **Correct**

- **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `3 % 2 != 0`, the cost should be `(3 // 2) * 11 + 5 = 15`.
  - **Correct**

- **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `4 % 2 == 0`, the cost should be `(4 / 2) * 11 = 22`. However, the correct cost is `20` (buying 2 pairs at promotion price).
  - **Issue:** The condition `B * 2 < C` should be `B < C` to correctly handle this case.

### Conclusion

The program has issues in the condition `B * 2 < C`. It should be `B < C` to correctly handle cases where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition for determining whether to buy yogurts individually or in pairs.
