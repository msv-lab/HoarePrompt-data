Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The program is supposed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts, considering the regular price `a` and the promotion price `b` for two yogurts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price `a` for one yogurt, and the price `b` for two yogurts.

2. **Determining the Minimum Cost:**
   - If `b * 2 < a`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price. However, the condition `b * 2 < a` is incorrect because `b` is already the price for two yogurts. The correct condition should be `b < a * 2` to check if the promotion price is cheaper.
   - If `n % 2 == 0`, it means `n` is even, and it's optimal to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the cost is `n * b / 2`.
   - If `n % 2 != 0`, it means `n` is odd, and it's optimal to buy `n // 2` pairs and one yogurt at the regular price, so the cost is `(n // 2) * b + a`.

The current implementation has a logical error in the first condition. The correct condition should be `b < a * 2` to determine if the promotion price is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < a * 2:
            # Promotion price is cheaper for two yogurts
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)
        else:
            # Regular price is cheaper or equal
            print(n * a)

# Example usage
# func()
```

Given the current implementation, the program is **incorrect** due to the logical error in the first condition.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
