### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the annotated code to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts during the promotion is `b` burles.
- The goal is to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

#### Program Logic Recap:
1. **Case 1:** If `2 * a < b`, it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. The total cost is `n * a`.
2. **Case 2:** If `2 * a >= b`, then:
   - If `n` is even, Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs, and the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and the remaining one yogurt individually. The total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and confirm the logic of the program.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - These values are stored in variables `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively.

2. **Logic Implementation:**
   - **Case 1:** If `2 * B < C`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `A * B`.
   - **Case 2:**
     - If `A` (which is `n`) is even (`A % 2 == 0`), the program correctly calculates the cost as `(A * C / 2)`. This is equivalent to `(n / 2) * b`.
     - If `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost as `(A // 2) * C + B`. Here, `A // 2` computes the number of pairs, and `B` is added for the remaining single yogurt. This is equivalent to `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

#### Validation with Example:
Let's validate the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `2 * 5 < 9`, the cost is `2 * 5 = 10`. However, the promotion price for 2 yogurts is `9`, so the correct output should be `9`.
   - **Issue:** The program incorrectly outputs `10` for this case. The condition should be `if B * 2 > C` to use the promotion price.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `2 * 5 < 9`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`. However, the promotion price for 2 yogurts is `9`, so the correct output should be `9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Issue:** The program incorrectly outputs `15` for this case. The condition should be `if B * 2 > C` to use the promotion price.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `2 * 5 < 11`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - The program correctly outputs `15` for this case.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `2 * 5 < 11`, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
   - The program correctly outputs `20` for this case.

#### Conclusion:
The program has incorrect logic in the first `if` condition. The condition `if B * 2 < C` should be `if B * 2 > C` to correctly use the promotion price when it is cheaper.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
