You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd; b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a 2D grid of size N x M, where each cell contains either "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". The number of players for each team (R and B) is between 1 and 10. There is exactly one Quaffle and at most one Bludger on the field. The number of steps (T) is a non-negative integer where 0 <= T <= 10000. Each step is a valid action performed by an entity on the field, which can be a player or a ball.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (x + dx, y + dy)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent the number of lines (N) and the number of columns (M) in a field, respectively. Both `a` and `b` are integers where 3 <= N <= 99 and 3 <= M <= 99, and both must be odd. The function returns a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`, which likely represents the new coordinates after applying some movement `dx` and `dy` to the initial coordinates `(x, y)` on the field.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns (x + dx, y + dy)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
