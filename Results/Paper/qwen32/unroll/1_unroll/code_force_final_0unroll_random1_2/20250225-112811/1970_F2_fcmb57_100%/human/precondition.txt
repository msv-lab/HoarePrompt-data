The function `add(a, b)` is not related to the problem description provided. The problem involves a game of Quidditch with specific input parameters. The input consists of integers N and M representing the dimensions of the field (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd), a field description with N lines of M pairs of characters representing the entities on the field, and T lines of actions to be performed by the entities (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000). The characters in the field description can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, ".Q" for the Quaffle, and ".B" for the Bludger. The actions can be "U", "D", "L", "R" for movement, "C" followed by a ball description for catching a ball, and "T" for throwing the Quaffle.
