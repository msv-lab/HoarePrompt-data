Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that would cause it to not function correctly according to the problem description. Here are some key points:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ball Catching and Throwing**: 
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The logic for throwing the Quaffle (`T` action) is incorrect. The Quaffle should always be moved to the middle of the field after a point is scored, regardless of which team scored.

2. **Incorrect Scoring Logic**:
   - The program checks if the player's position is in the goals of both teams, which is incorrect. It should check if the player's position is in the goals of the opposing team.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should result in a point for the opposing team.

3. **Incorrect Elimination Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a player is eliminated by the Bludger, but it does not handle the case where the Quaffle is left on the cell where the player and Bludger were eliminated.

4. **Incorrect Movement Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the Quaffle is moved by a player. The Quaffle should follow the player's movements if the player is carrying it.

5. **Incorrect Function Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is correctly defined to handle movement but is not used consistently. For example, the Bludger's movement is not handled by this function.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        if mo[0] == '.B':
            players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        else:
            old_pos = players[mo[0]]
            players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
            if quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch = [players[c], '']
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        quidditch[0] = middle
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should work correctly according to the problem description.
