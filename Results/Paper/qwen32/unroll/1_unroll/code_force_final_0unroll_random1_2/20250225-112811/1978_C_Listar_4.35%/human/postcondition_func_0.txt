The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns a rearranged list of integers from 1 to `n` based on the value of `k` after it has been halved. The rearrangement involves moving the last element of the list to a specific position determined by the value of `k`, potentially multiple times, until `k` is reduced to 0.
