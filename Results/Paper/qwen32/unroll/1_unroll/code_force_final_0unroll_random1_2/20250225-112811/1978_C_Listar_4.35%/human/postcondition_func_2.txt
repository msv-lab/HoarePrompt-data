The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `l` representing a permutation of length `n`, where each integer is distinct and in the range from 1 to `n`. It prints "YES" followed by the integers in the list `l` in the same order, separated by spaces, and then prints a newline. The function returns nothing.
