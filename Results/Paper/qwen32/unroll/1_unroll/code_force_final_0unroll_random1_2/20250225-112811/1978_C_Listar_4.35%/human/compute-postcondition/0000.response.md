The code snippet `n, k = func_2()` assigns the values returned by the function `func_2()` to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^12. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to whatever values are returned by `func_2()`. The precondition on the range of `n` and `k` is no longer valid because the function `func_2()` could return any values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`**.
