The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` where each element is a tuple containing the number of problems `n`, the number of upcoming rounds `m`, and a string `a` of problem difficulties. The function returns a list of `t` integers, each indicating the number of missing problem difficulties required to meet the demand for each test case.
