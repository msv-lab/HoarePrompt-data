Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the function `func_1`. The issue arises from the fact that the program assumes that the minimum number of problems needed is the sum of the deficits of each difficulty level across all rounds. However, the problem requires that each round must have exactly one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. Therefore, the correct approach should be to ensure that for each round, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level. This means that for `m` rounds, we need to ensure that the frequency of each difficulty level is at least `m`.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 7, m = 2, a = 'ABCDEFG'`
- Expected Output: `7` (since each round needs one problem of each difficulty level, and we have only one of each, so we need 7 more problems)
- Actual Output: `0` (the program will output 0 because it sums the deficits of each level across all rounds, which in this case are all zero)

The correct approach should be to check if each difficulty level has at least `m` problems and sum the deficits accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.
    """
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        missing = sum((max(0, m - f) for f in freq))
        results.append(missing * m)
    return results
```

However, the above corrected version still has an issue. The correct approach should be:
