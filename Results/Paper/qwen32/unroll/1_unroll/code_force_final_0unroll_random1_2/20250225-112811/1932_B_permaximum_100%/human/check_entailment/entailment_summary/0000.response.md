Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign as described in the problem statement. The program iterates through each test case, and for each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year based on the periodicity and the year of the previous sign's occurrence.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes `current_year` to 0.
4. For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence will be `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, the next occurrence will be the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
5. It updates `current_year` to the `next_year` for the next iteration.
6. After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `current_year` to the `results` list.
7. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This logic correctly implements the problem's requirement to find the year in which each sign occurs sequentially, starting from year 0. The execution summary provided also aligns with this understanding, confirming that the function computes the smallest year that is a multiple of each sign's periodicity in sequence.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
