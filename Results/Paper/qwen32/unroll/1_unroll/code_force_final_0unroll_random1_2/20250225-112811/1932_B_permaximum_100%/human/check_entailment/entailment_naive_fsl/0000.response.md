Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and their respective periodicities, `a`.
3. It then processes each test case by iterating through the list of periodicities.
4. For each periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur:
   - If the `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence will be `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the next occurrence as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
5. The `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence year, and this process is repeated for all signs.
6. Finally, the program outputs the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the tribe waits for each sign to occur strictly after the previous one, starting from the year after the previous sign's occurrence. The provided examples in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program, and no edge cases seem to be overlooked based on the given constraints and requirements.
