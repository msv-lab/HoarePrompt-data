Let's carefully analyze the program and the provided function summary to evaluate the correctness of the implementation.

### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and the signs must occur sequentially. Specifically, after the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the (i+1)-th sign will occur in the smallest year `y > x` that is a multiple of `a_(i+1)`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case by iterating through the list of periodicities.
   - For each periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence will be `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next occurrence as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

3. **Updating `current_year`:**
   - The `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence year, and this process is repeated for all signs.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

### Function Summary:
- The function summary describes the function as calculating the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding `a_list` from `test_cases`. However, this is not entirely accurate. The function is actually calculating the year in which each sign will occur sequentially, not the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periods.

### Validation Against the Problem Description:
- The logic in the program correctly implements the sequential occurrence of signs. It ensures that after the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the (i+1)-th sign will occur in the smallest year `y > x` that is a multiple of `a_(i+1)`.
- The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The function summary, while not perfectly precise in its wording, does not mislead about the core functionality of the function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
