You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding `a_list` from `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a_list` of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding `a_list` from `test_cases`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and their respective periodicities, `a`.
3. It then processes each test case by iterating through the list of periodicities.
4. For each periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur:
   - If the `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence will be `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the next occurrence as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
5. The `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence year, and this process is repeated for all signs.
6. Finally, the program outputs the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the tribe waits for each sign to occur strictly after the previous one, starting from the year after the previous sign's occurrence. The provided examples in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program, and no edge cases seem to be overlooked based on the given constraints and requirements.
