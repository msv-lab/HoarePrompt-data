To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to understand the structure and contents of the `results` list based on the given initial state.

### Given Initial State:
- `results` is a list containing the results of all queries for each test case, followed by an empty string for each test case.
- `data`, `t`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial values except `idx` which will point past the last element processed.

### Analysis:
- The `results` list contains the results of queries for each test case.
- After each test case's results, an empty string is appended to the `results` list.
- The `'\n'.join(results)` operation will concatenate all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

### Example Structure of `results`:
Assume we have 2 test cases with the following results:
- Test Case 1: ["Result1", "Result2"]
- Test Case 2: ["Result3", "Result4"]

The `results` list would look like this:
```python
results = ["Result1", "Result2", "", "Result3", "Result4", ""]
```

### Output:
When the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement is executed, it will print:
```
Result1
Result2

Result3
Result4

```

### Explanation:
- Each result from each test case is printed on a new line.
- An empty string in the `results` list causes an additional newline to be printed, separating the results of different test cases.

### Final Output:
Output: **Result1\nResult2\n\nResult3\nResult4\n** (where each test case's results are separated by an additional newline)
