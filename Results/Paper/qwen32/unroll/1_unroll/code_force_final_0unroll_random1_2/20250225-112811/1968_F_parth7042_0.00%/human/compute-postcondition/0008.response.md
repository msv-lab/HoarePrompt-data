Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and `q`. For each test case, an array `a` of `n` integers is provided, where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and \(2^{30} - 1\). Additionally, `q` queries are given, each defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query.**
