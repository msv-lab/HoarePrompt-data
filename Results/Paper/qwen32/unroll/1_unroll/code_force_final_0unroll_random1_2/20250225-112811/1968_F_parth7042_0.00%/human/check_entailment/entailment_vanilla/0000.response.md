Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once and processes it.
   - It first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of elements in the array) and `q` (the number of queries).
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.
   - For each query, it reads `l` and `r` which define a subarray `a[l:r+1]`.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - The prefix XOR is used to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This helps in quickly finding indices where a certain prefix XOR value appears.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it immediately answers "YES" because the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR `0`.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is not `0`, it checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR mapping that can help determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
   - The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the prefix XOR mapping to check if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for all queries in all test cases are collected and printed at the end.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation:** The prefix XOR array is correctly computed, and it allows for efficient computation of the XOR of any subarray.
- **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:** The dictionary `mp` correctly maps prefix XOR values to their indices, which is useful for checking if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
- **Query Processing:** The logic for processing each query is sound. If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, the subarray is trivially interesting. Otherwise, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR mapping that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as when the XOR of the subarray is `0` and when the subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. It efficiently handles the input and computes the required results.

**Correctness: True**
