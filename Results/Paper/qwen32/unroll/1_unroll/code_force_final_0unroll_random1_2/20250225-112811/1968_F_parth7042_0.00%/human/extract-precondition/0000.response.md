Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array a contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
