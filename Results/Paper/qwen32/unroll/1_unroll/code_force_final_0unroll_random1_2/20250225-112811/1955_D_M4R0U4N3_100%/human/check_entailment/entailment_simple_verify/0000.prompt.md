You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, all initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `ans`, `curr`, `i`) do not retain their values after the loop finishes as they are local to each iteration of the outer loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. The issue lies in the fact that the `cnt_b` array is not reset between test cases. This means that the frequency counts from previous test cases can carry over and affect the results of subsequent test cases.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initialization of `cnt_b`**:
   The `cnt_b` array is initialized outside the main loop that processes each test case. This means that the counts of elements from the previous test case are not reset before processing the next test case.

2. **Effect on Subsequent Test Cases**:
   If the same element appears in both the current and previous test cases, the count in `cnt_b` will be incorrect because it will include the counts from the previous test case. This can lead to incorrect matching counts and, consequently, incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the `cnt_b` array should be reinitialized to zero at the beginning of each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)  # Reinitialize cnt_b for each test case
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

By reinitializing `cnt_b` at the start of each test case, the program ensures that the frequency counts are accurate for each test case, leading to correct results.
