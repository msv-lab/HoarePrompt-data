You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    max_val = 1000000
    cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:

        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        for i in b_values:
            cnt_b[i] = 0
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, all initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `ans`, `curr`, `i`) do not retain their values after the loop finishes as they are local to each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. The integer `t` satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and the list `b` contains `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
