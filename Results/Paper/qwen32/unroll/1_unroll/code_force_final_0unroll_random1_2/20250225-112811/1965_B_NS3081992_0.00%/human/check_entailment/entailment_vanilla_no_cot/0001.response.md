Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
3. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a function `func_14()` to generate the sequence for each test case. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `func_10()` reads an integer from the input (number of test cases).
   - `func_7()` reads two integers `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - `b = bin(n)[2:]` converts `n` to its binary representation as a string.
   - `l = len(b)` stores the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts `k` to its binary representation as a string.
   - `lk = len(bk)` stores the length of the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, the sequence is `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`.
   - **Case 2: `k > 1`**
     - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`.
     - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - It includes `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to cover sums around `k`.
     - Finally, it adds powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The sequence is converted to a string and printed.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case 1 (`k == 1`)**:
  - The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, ...]` ensures that no subsequence sums to `1` because the smallest element is `2`.
  - All sums from `2` to `n` (except `1`) can be formed using combinations of these powers of 2 and `3`.

- **Case 2 (`k > 1`)**:
  - The sequence includes powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`, which can form all sums up to `2^(lk-1) - 1`.
  - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
  - The terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensure that sums around `k` can be formed.
  - The remaining powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to satisfy both conditions of the problem. It generates a sequence of at most 25 non-negative integers that ensures no subsequence sums to `k` while all other sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
