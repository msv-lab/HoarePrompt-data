You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_15` does not take any parameters directly. It relies on other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) which are not provided in the snippet. However, based on the usage, `func_10` likely returns the number of test cases (t), and `func_14` likely processes each test case to determine the size of the sequence (m) and the sequence itself (a_i).
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains the result of `func_14()` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_15` does not take any direct parameters. It utilizes other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) to determine the number of test cases and process each test case to determine the size of the sequence and the sequence itself. For each test case, it returns the result of processing the sequence.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
