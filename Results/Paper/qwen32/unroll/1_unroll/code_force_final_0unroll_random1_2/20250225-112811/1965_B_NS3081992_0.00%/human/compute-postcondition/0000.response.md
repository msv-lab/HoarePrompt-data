In the provided code snippet, the for loop relies on the return value of `func_10()`, which is not provided. Based on the context, `func_10()` likely returns the number of test cases (`t`). The loop will execute as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

To ensure the loop executes, the return value of `func_10()` must be greater than 0. The loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is a throwaway variable used for iteration.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
