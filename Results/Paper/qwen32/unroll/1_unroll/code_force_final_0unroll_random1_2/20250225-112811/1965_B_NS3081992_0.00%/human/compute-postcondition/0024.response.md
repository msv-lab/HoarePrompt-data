Functionality: **The function `func_14` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 10^6, and `k` is between 1 and `n`. It returns a string. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of integers based on the values of `n` and `k` and returns them as a space-separated string.**
