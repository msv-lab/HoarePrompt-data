To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we will carefully analyze the logic and the function summaries, focusing on the core functionality implemented in `func_14`.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) that are not directly related to solving the problem, and two main functions (`func_14` and `func_15`).

- `func_14`: This function generates the sequence for a given pair `(n, k)`.
- `func_15`: This function reads the number of test cases and applies `func_14` to each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_14`:

#### Special Case `k == 1`:
- **When `n == 2`**: The sequence `[2]` is returned.
  - **Correctness**: The only possible sums are `0` and `2`. `1` cannot be formed, which satisfies the condition.
- **When `n > 2`**: The sequence `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` is returned.
  - **Correctness**: 
    - The sequence `[2, 3]` ensures that sums like `2`, `3`, and `5` can be formed.
    - Adding powers of 2 (e.g., `4`, `8`, `16`, etc.) ensures that all sums up to `n` can be formed except for `1`.
    - This is because the powers of 2 and the numbers `2` and `3` can create any sum except `1`.

#### General Case `k != 1`:
- **Steps**:
  1. **Construct powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`**: This ensures that all sums up to `k-1` can be formed.
  2. **Add `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`**:
     - **`k - 1 - sum(ans)`**: Ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed.
     - **`k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`**: Ensures that sums greater than `k` can be formed.
  3. **Add powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`**: Ensures that all sums up to `n` can be formed except `k`.

### Verification of the Construction:
- **No Subsequence Sum Equals `k`**:
  - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of the sequence elements.
  - The numbers `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are chosen to avoid forming `k` as a sum.
- **All Subsequences Sum to `v` for `1 <= v <= n` and `v != k`**:
  - The powers of 2 and the chosen numbers ensure that all sums up to `n` except `k` can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs sequences that satisfy the problem's conditions for all test cases. The logic in `func_14` ensures that the sequence meets the requirements by carefully selecting the numbers to include.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
