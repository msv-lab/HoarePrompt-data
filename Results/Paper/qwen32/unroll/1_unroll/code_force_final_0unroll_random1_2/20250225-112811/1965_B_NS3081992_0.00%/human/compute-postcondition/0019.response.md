The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `lk < l`.
2. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, which is the binary representation of `n`.
3. `lk` is not defined in the given state, so it needs to be defined in a way that ensures `lk < l`.

To make sure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `lk` is less than `l`. If we don't have any specific value for `lk`, we can set it to 0, which is a common starting point for such loops.

So, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`, `lk` is 0**
