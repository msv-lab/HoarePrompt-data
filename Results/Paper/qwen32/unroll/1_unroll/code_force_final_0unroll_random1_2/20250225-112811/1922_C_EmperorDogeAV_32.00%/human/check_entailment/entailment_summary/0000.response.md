Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between pairs of cities, given the unique closest city constraint. Here's a breakdown of the logic and the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of cities, their coordinates, the number of queries, and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Determination**: The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost of moving to the closest city for each city (except the first and last). However, there are a few issues:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list where each element is either `1` (indicating a move to the closest city) or the distance to the closest city. However, it does not handle the first and last city correctly. The first city can only move to the second city, and the last city can only move to the second last city.
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly uses `forward` and `back` variables for comparison, but it does not correctly handle the first and last cities. The first city should always have a cost of `1` to move to the second city, and the last city should always have a cost of `1` to move to the second last city.
   - The logic for determining the closest city is flawed. The function should compare the distances to the next and previous cities and return `1` if the closest city is the next city, otherwise it should return the distance to the next city. However, the function does not correctly handle the first and last cities, and the comparison is flawed for intermediate cities as well.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward movements. The prefix sums are supposed to help in calculating the total cost of moving from one city to another. However, due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the prefix sums are also incorrect.

4. **Query Processing**: The program processes each query by determining whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums to calculate the total cost of moving from one city to another. However, due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1` and the resulting incorrect prefix sums, the calculated costs are incorrect.

Given the issues with the implementation of `func_1` and the resulting incorrect prefix sums, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between pairs of cities.

Correctness: **False**
