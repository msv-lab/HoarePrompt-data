### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the implementation of the function `func_1`. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the assessment.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where moving to the closest city always costs 1 coin.
   - The closest city for each city is uniquely determined, and the cities are given in ascending order on a number line.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine whether moving to the next city (forward or backward) is the closest move and should cost 1 coin.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` assigns `1` only when the next city is closer and assigns the actual distance otherwise. This is incorrect because moving to the closest city should always cost `1` coin, regardless of the actual distance.
   - The correct implementation should always assign `1` to each element in the list returned by `func_1`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are calculated based on the values returned by `func_1`.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect, leading to incorrect results when processing queries.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - The logic for processing queries is correct in the sense that it uses the prefix sums to calculate the cost.
   - However, since the prefix sums are incorrect due to the flawed `func_1`, the results will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is implemented incorrectly, and this flaw results in incorrect prefix sums and, consequently, incorrect query results. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
