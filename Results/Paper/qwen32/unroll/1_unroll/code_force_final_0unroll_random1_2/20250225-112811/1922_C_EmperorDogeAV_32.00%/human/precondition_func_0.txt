cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. Each a_i is a non-negative integer and a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. Each x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
