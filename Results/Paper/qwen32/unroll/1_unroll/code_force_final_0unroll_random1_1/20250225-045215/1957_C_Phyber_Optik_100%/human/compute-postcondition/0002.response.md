In the given task, the for loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `n + 1` (exclusive). The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute, as starting from `i = 3` requires `n` to be at least 3.

The state of `t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp` values are not directly relevant to whether the loop can execute or not, as they are not part of the loop head. The only requirement is that `i` starts at 3, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
