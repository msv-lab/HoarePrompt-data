### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by precomputing the number of possible final configurations for a given board size `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. The core of the solution lies in the dynamic programming array `dp`, which is precomputed using a specific recurrence relation.

1. **Initialization and Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes the `dp` array with size 300007 (to handle the maximum `n` of 300000).
   - It sets `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, as per the problem constraints.
   - It then computes `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to 300000 using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This precomputation step ensures that for any given `n`, the number of possible final configurations can be quickly retrieved from the `dp` array.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to the `invalid` set to keep track of the positions that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The number of remaining valid positions is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The program then prints the value of `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which represents the number of possible final configurations for the remaining valid positions.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The recurrence relation used in the precomputation step is derived from the problem's constraints and the nature of the game. Specifically, it accounts for the fact that each new rook placement reduces the number of available positions and the possible configurations.
   - The program correctly handles the precomputation and uses the precomputed values to answer each test case efficiently.
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the results do not overflow and remain within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution based on the problem description and the given constraints. It precomputes the number of possible final configurations for different board sizes and efficiently answers each test case using the precomputed values.

**Correctness: True**
