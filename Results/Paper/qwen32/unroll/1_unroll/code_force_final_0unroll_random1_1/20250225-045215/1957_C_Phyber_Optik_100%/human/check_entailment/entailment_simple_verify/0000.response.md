### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Chessboard and Moves**: We have an `n x n` chessboard where players take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
2. **Mirroring Rule**: After each player's move, the computer mirrors the move unless `r = c`.
3. **Objective**: Determine the number of different final configurations possible after playing `k` moves.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Use of `dp` Array**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007.
   - The function `func_1` is called with an argument of 300000 before it's defined, which would cause an error if the function were not defined elsewhere or if the call were not moved.
   - The function `func_1` is defined later in the code to populate the `dp` array using a specific recurrence relation.

2. **Handling of Invalid Rows and Columns**:
   - The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - Both `r` and `c` are added to the same set, which is incorrect. The program should maintain separate sets for rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The program calculates the number of free rows/columns by subtracting the length of the `invalid` set from `n`. This is incorrect because `invalid` contains both row and column indices, leading to an incorrect count of free rows/columns.

3. **Dynamic Programming Formula**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` seems to be derived from combinatorial principles for placing non-attacking rooks on a board. However, it does not account for the mirroring rule and the specific constraints of the problem.
   - The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is intended to calculate the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board with `i` free rows/columns, but it does not consider the mirroring rule correctly.

4. **Mirroring Rule**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the mirroring rule. If a player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the computer should place a rook at `(c, r)`, except when `r = c`. The program does not implement this rule correctly, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `k = 0` or `k = n` correctly. When `k = 0`, the board is completely free, and the number of configurations should be based on the size of the board. When `k = n`, there are no more valid moves, and the number of configurations should be 1 if the board is fully occupied without conflicts.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the `dp` array is computed correctly using the provided recurrence relation.
- However, the annotations do not address the issues with handling invalid rows and columns or the mirroring rule.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with handling invalid rows and columns and the incorrect implementation of the mirroring rule, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
