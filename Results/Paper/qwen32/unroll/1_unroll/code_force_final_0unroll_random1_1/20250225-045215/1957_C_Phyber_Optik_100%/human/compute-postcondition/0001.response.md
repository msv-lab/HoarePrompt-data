Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`, representing the i-th move you made. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `dp[1]` is 1. `dp[2]` is 3.**

In simple terms, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `dp[2]` is now assigned the value 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
