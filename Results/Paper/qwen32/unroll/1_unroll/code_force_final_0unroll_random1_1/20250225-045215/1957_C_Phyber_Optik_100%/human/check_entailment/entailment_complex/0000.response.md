### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of different final configurations possible on an n x n chessboard after k moves, where the moves are made according to specific rules involving rooks. The program provided uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for different board sizes and then uses these precomputed values to answer each test case.

Let's break down the program and its correctness:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a DP array `dp` with a size of 300007, which is more than enough given the constraint that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
   - The `func_1` function is called with `300000` as an argument. This function initializes `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, and then uses a loop to fill in the values of `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `n` using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices of these moves to a set called `invalid`, which keeps track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The program calculates the number of free rows and columns by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which represents the number of different final configurations possible for the remaining free rows and columns.

### Verification of the Recurrence Relation:
- The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is derived from the problem's combinatorial nature. It correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `i` given the constraints of the problem.
- The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are also correct:
  - For `n = 1`, there is only one configuration (placing a single rook).
  - For `n = 2`, there are three configurations: placing two rooks in different rows and columns, placing two rooks on the main diagonal, and placing two rooks on the anti-diagonal.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It precomputes the number of configurations for different board sizes and uses these precomputed values to efficiently answer each test case. The recurrence relation and base cases are correctly derived from the problem's constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
