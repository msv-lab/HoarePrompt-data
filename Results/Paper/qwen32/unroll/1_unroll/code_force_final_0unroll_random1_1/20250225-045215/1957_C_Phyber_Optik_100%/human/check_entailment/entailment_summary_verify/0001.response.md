### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem involves an `n x n` chessboard where rooks are placed by two players alternately, with the second player mirroring the moves of the first player. The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations of rooks on the board after `k` initial moves, where no two rooks can attack each other.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initial Moves:** `k` moves are already made, and the computer mirrors these moves.
2. **Final Configurations:** We need to determine the number of possible configurations after all valid moves are made.
3. **Constraints:** The size of the board `n` can be up to `3 * 10^5`, and the number of test cases `t` can be up to `10^4`.

#### Code Analysis

1. **Precomputation (`func_1` function):**
   - The function `func_1` precomputes the number of configurations for different board sizes using dynamic programming.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of configurations for an `i x i` board.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` (board size) and `k` (number of initial moves).
   - It then reads the `k` moves and marks the rows and columns where rooks are placed as invalid.
   - The number of remaining valid rows and columns is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The result for each test case is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

#### Issues with the Program

1. **Invalid Set Usage:**
   - The `invalid` set is used to mark rows and columns that are occupied by rooks. However, it incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the set, which means it treats them as unique identifiers without distinguishing between rows and columns.
   - This can lead to an overcounting of invalid positions, especially when `r == c`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Recurrence Relation:**
   - The recurrence relation used in the program might not correctly represent the number of configurations for the given problem. The relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2])` does not accurately model the problem's constraints and dynamics.
   - The recurrence relation seems to be derived from a different problem, possibly related to non-attacking rooks but not considering the mirroring aspect.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` might be correct, but the recurrence relation and the way invalid positions are handled suggest that the precomputation might not be accurate.

#### Correctness

Given the issues with how invalid positions are counted and the potential inaccuracy of the dynamic programming recurrence relation, the program is likely incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
