### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_7()` reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic in `func_14()`:**
   - Converts `n` and `k` to binary strings to determine their lengths.
   - If `k == 1`, it constructs a sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]` where `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k != 1`, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2)]` where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum([2^i for i in range(lk - 1)])`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and `[2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1)]` to the sequence.
   - The sequence is designed to ensure that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by some subsequence, and no subsequence sums to `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, `func_14()` returns a space-separated string of the sequence.
   - `func_15()` prints this sequence for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Condition 1:** There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - The construction of the sequence ensures that `k` is not achievable as a sum.
- **Condition 2:** For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
  - The sequence includes powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)` and additional elements to ensure all sums except `k` can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence for each test case based on the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
