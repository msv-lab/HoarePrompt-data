The code snippet `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. 

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints, `b` is the binary string representation of `n`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`, and `ans` is an empty list. The only variable that changes is `lk`, which is now assigned the length of `bk`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`; `ans` is an empty list.**
