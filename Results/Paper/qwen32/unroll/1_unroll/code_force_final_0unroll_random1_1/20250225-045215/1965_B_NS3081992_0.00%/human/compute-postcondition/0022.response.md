To determine the output state, we need to consider the conditions provided and the resulting value of `ans` based on those conditions.

### Given Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.
- `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` is the length of the binary string `b`.
- If `k` equals 1, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.

### Code Execution:
The code returns a string that is the space-separated representation of the list `ans`.

### Output State:
Depending on the value of `k`, `ans` will be one of two lists. We need to describe both possibilities.

#### Case 1: `k` equals 1
- `ans` will be `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]`.
- The output will be a space-separated string of these values.

#### Case 2: `k` is not equal to 1
- `ans` will be `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
- The output will be a space-separated string of these values.

### Final Output State:
Since `k` can be any integer from 1 to `n`, we need to cover both scenarios. However, the output format is the same in both cases, just with different values in the list.

Output State: **The program returns a space-separated string of the list `ans`, where `ans` is `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]` if `k` equals 1, or `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]` if `k` does not equal 1.**
