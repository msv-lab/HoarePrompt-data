To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The key variable here is the return value of `func_10()`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (not used within the loop body), we don't need to adjust its state. The critical factor is ensuring that `func_10()` returns a value that is at least 1 to allow the loop to execute.

Given that `func_10()` is responsible for providing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that it returns a positive integer. The state of `func_10()` itself cannot be directly adjusted, but we can infer the necessary condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
