To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` list. The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1` and appends `2 ** i` to the `ans` list for each iteration.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers with `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`.
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of the binary string `b`.
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`.
   - `ans` is initialized as `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`.
   - For each iteration, `2 ** i` is appended to the `ans` list.

3. **Output State:**
   - After the loop, `ans` will contain the initial elements `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by `2 ** i` for each `i` in the range from `lk` to `l-1`.

In natural language, the output state is: the `ans` list will start with the elements `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` and will be extended by the powers of 2 from `2 ** lk` to `2 ** (l - 1)`.

Output State: **`ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)]`.**
