The function `func_12` calculates a rank for a given integer `da` based on a recursive evaluation of a dictionary `d` and a processing list. It updates the `rank` list with the calculated rank for `da`. The function returns `1` if the list associated with `da` in `d` contains only one element; otherwise, it returns the minimum rank value obtained from recursive calls plus one.
