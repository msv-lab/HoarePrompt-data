Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the described algorithm. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of `b` List**: The list `b` in the function `func_1` is not used to store the elements as they are removed from the array `a`. Instead, it stores elements based on the command ('L' or 'R') but does not correctly reflect the actual array state after each removal.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Product**: The product calculation is done on the elements stored in the list `b` in reverse order, which does not match the requirement of calculating the product of the current state of the array `a` before each removal.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The output is generated from the list `ans`, which contains the product remainders in reverse order due to the use of `reversed(ans)`. However, the product calculation is not done correctly in the first place.

To fix the program, we need to calculate the product of the current state of the array `a` before each removal and then remove the element as specified by the command. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    ans = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        ans.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[left], m-2, m)) % m  # Using modular inverse to remove the leftmost element
            left += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[right], m-2, m)) % m  # Using modular inverse to remove the rightmost element
            right -= 1
    
    return ans
```

However, the above code assumes that `m` is prime for the use of Fermat's Little Theorem to calculate the modular inverse. If `m` is not prime, a more general method like the Extended Euclidean Algorithm should be used to compute the modular inverse.

For the given problem constraints, a simpler approach is to recalculate the product after each removal, which is more straightforward and avoids issues with modular inverses:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    for command in s:
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        ans.append(product)
        
        if command == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    
    return ans
```

This approach recalculates the product from scratch after each removal, which is simpler and works within the problem constraints.
