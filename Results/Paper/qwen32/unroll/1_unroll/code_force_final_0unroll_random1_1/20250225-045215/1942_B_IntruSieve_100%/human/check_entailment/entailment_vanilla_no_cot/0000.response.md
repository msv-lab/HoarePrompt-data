Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). The program incorrectly calculates the MEX and the values of \( p \) by not properly handling the relationship between \( a_i \) and \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) \).

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by maintaining a `minn` variable which is incremented whenever a number is used. However, this approach does not correctly handle the MEX calculation, especially when \( a_i \) is negative.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**: The program incorrectly calculates the value of \( p_i \) when \( a_i \) is negative. The correct value of \( p_i \) should be \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{i-1}) - a_i \), but the program incorrectly calculates it as \( \texttt{abs}(a_i - \texttt{minn}) \).

3. **Incorrect Use of `used` Dictionary**: The program uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of numbers that have been used in the permutation. However, it does not correctly update this dictionary or use it to determine the correct MEX.

To correctly solve the problem, one should follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list `p` to store the permutation.
2. Initialize a set `used` to keep track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation.
3. For each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \):
   - Calculate the MEX of the current permutation `p`.
   - Determine the value of \( p_i \) as \( \texttt{MEX} - a_i \).
   - Add \( p_i \) to the permutation `p` and mark it as used in the set `used`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    used = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p_i = mex - arr[i]
        p.append(p_i)
        used.add(p_i)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) by properly calculating the MEX and determining the value of \( p_i \).
