You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes each test case consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of integers `mex` based on the values in `a` and prints this sequence. The sequence `mex` is derived such that for each positive element in `a`, it appends the smallest unused non-negative integer to `mex`, and for each non-positive element, it appends the absolute difference between the element and the smallest unused non-negative integer. After processing each test case, it prints the sequence `mex` followed by a newline.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Let's analyze why:

The key component of the problem is to determine the permutation \( p \) such that for each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \), the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) holds.

The provided code attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) by maintaining a `mex` list and a `used` dictionary to keep track of the numbers that have been used so far. However, the logic for determining the elements of \( p \) is flawed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization of `minn` and `used`**:
   - `minn` starts at 0 and is used to find the MEX value.
   - `used` is a dictionary that keeps track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation.

2. **Processing each element in `arr`**:
   - If `arr[i] > 0`, the code appends `minn` to the `mex` list, marks `minn` as used, and increments `minn` until it finds the next unused number.
   - If `arr[i] <= 0`, the code calculates the value to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and marks this value as used.

3. **Output**:
   - The code prints the `mex` list, which is supposed to be the permutation \( p \).

### Issues:
- The logic for determining the elements of \( p \) is incorrect. The code is not correctly using the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) to find the elements of \( p \).
- The `used` dictionary and `minn` are not being updated in a way that ensures the correct MEX value is found for each step.

### Example:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The correct output should be a permutation \( p \) such that:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1) - p_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2) - p_2 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3) - p_3 = -2 \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) - p_4 = 1 \)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5) - p_5 = 2 \)

One valid permutation \( p \) is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

However, the provided code does not correctly reconstruct this permutation. Instead, it outputs a sequence that does not satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). There are cases where the program will not produce a valid permutation that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
