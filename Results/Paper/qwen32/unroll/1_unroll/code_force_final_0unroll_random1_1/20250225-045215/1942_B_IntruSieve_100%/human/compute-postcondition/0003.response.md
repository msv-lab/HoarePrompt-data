The given code snippet only modifies the variable `minn` by assigning it the value `0`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`) are affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the length of the permutation p and the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), the elements of array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0.**
