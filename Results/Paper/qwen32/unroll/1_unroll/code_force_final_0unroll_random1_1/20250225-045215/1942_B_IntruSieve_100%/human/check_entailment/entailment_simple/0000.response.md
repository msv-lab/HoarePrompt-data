### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem by constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the values of the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the smallest unused non-negative integer.
   - `used` is initialized as an empty dictionary to keep track of which integers have been used in the permutation.

2. **Processing the Array `a`**:
   - For each element in `a`, the program checks if the element is greater than 0.
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex`, marks `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary, and then increments `minn` to the next unused non-negative integer.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it calculates the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to `mex`. It also marks this value as used in the `used` dictionary.
   - This process ensures that the values in `mex` are calculated based on the given array `a` and the current smallest unused non-negative integer `minn`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the values in `mex` separated by spaces, which represents the permutation `p`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly calculate the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Specifically, the logic for handling `arr[i] <= 0` is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the smallest unused integer that satisfies the equation `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.
- The current implementation directly uses `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for `arr[i] <= 0`, which does not guarantee that the resulting permutation `p` will satisfy the condition for all elements in `a`.

### Correct Approach:
- For each element in `a`, the program should find the smallest unused integer `p_i` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.
- This can be achieved by maintaining a set of used integers and iterating through possible values to find the correct `p_i`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
