Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The logic is based on counting the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string, as each such transition indicates a necessary cut to separate the '1's and '0's into different pieces. The final result is `count + 1` because the number of pieces is one more than the number of cuts needed. This approach aligns with the problem's requirements and passes the given examples.
