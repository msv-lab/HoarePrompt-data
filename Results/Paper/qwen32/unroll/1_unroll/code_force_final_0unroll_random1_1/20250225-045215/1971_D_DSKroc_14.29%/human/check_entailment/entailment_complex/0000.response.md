### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) a binary string can be cut into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The key observation is that every time we encounter a transition from '1' to '0' in the string, it indicates that we need to cut the string at that point to ensure that the '1's and '0's can be rearranged correctly. Each such transition suggests a boundary between two pieces.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: We start with a count of 0, which will keep track of the number of '1' to '0' transitions.
2. **Iterate through the string**: For each character in the string (except the last one), we compare it with the next character.
3. **Count transitions**: Whenever we find a '1' followed by a '0', we increment the count.
4. **Calculate the number of pieces**: The number of pieces needed is the count of these transitions plus one (to account for the initial segment before the first transition).

The provided code correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases, processes each binary string, and prints the correct number of pieces required for each case.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For the input `11010`:
  - Transition from '1' to '0' at index 1.
  - Transition from '1' to '0' at index 3.
  - Total transitions: 2.
  - Minimum pieces required: 2 + 1 = 3.

- For the input `00000000`:
  - No transitions.
  - Minimum pieces required: 0 + 1 = 1.

- For the input `1`:
  - No transitions.
  - Minimum pieces required: 0 + 1 = 1.

- For the input `10`:
  - Transition from '1' to '0' at index 0.
  - Total transitions: 1.
  - Minimum pieces required: 1 + 1 = 2.

- For the input `0001111`:
  - No transitions.
  - Minimum pieces required: 0 + 1 = 1.

- For the input `0110`:
  - Transition from '0' to '1' at index 0 (not counted).
  - Transition from '1' to '0' at index 2.
  - Total transitions: 1.
  - Minimum pieces required: 1 + 1 = 2.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces required for each test case based on the transitions from '1' to '0'. Therefore, the program is correct.
