### Reasoning:

The problem at hand requires determining the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string must be cut into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string is one where all '0's come before all '1's.

The provided program follows a logical approach to solve this problem:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
4. It iterates through the string `s` and increments `count` each time it encounters a '1' immediately followed by a '0'.
5. Finally, it prints `count + 1` as the result for each test case.

The logic behind `count + 1` is that each transition from '1' to '0' indicates a boundary where the string must be cut to ensure that all '0's can be moved before all '1's in the rearrangement. The initial segment before the first '1' to '0' transition also counts as a piece, hence the addition of 1 to the `count`.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:
- For the string "11010":
  - Transitions from '1' to '0': 11**0**10, 110**1**0
  - Number of transitions = 2
  - Minimum pieces = 2 + 1 = 3

- For the string "00000000":
  - No '1' to '0' transitions
  - Minimum pieces = 0 + 1 = 1

- For the string "1":
  - No '1' to '0' transitions
  - Minimum pieces = 0 + 1 = 1

- For the string "10":
  - Transition from '1' to '0': 1**0**
  - Number of transitions = 1
  - Minimum pieces = 1 + 1 = 2

- For the string "0001111":
  - No '1' to '0' transitions
  - Minimum pieces = 0 + 1 = 1

- For the string "0110":
  - Transition from '1' to '0': 01**1**0
  - Number of transitions = 1
  - Minimum pieces = 1 + 1 = 2

The results from the program match the expected outputs for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
