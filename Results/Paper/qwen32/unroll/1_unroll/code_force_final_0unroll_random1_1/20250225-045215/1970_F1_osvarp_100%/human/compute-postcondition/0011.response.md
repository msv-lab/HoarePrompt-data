The `print` statement is formatted to display the final scores of the red and blue teams using the values stored in the `points` list. According to the initial state, `points` is a list containing two integers where the first integer represents the score of the red team and the second integer represents the score of the blue team.

The format specifier `%d` in the string is used to insert the integer values from the `points` list. Specifically, `points[0]` will be inserted in place of the first `%d` and `points[1]` will be inserted in place of the second `%d`.

Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] is the score of the red team and points[1] is the score of the blue team)**
