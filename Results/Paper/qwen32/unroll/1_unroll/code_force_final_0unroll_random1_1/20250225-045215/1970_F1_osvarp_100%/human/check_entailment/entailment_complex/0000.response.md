Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the provided Python code and see if it meets the problem description and handles the given examples correctly.

1. **Initialization and Parsing**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the dimensions of the grid (N and M), initializes the grid, and reads the grid layout.
   - It also initializes dictionaries to keep track of the positions of all entities and the status of players carrying the Quaffle.
   - Goals are categorized into two lists based on the team they belong to.
   - The initial scores of both teams are set to 0.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - For each command, the function checks whether it involves catching a ball or a simple movement.
   - If the command involves catching the Quaffle, the player's status in `allPlayers` is updated.
   - If the command involves throwing the Quaffle, the function checks if the current position of the player is a goal for the opposing team. If it is, the score is updated, and an event is printed.
   - The function also updates the positions of the players and the bludger according to the commands.

3. **Goal Checking**:
   - The function `goalIn` checks if a given position is a goal for the red team, the blue team, or neither, and returns 0, 1, or -1, respectively.

4. **Player Identification**:
   - The function `isPlayer` checks if a given entity is a player by verifying the format of the string.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the events of the game as they occur.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final scores.

Let's verify the correctness by checking the examples provided:

- **Example 1**:
  - The blue player scores at time 6, and the red player scores at time 12.
  - The final score is 1-1.
  
- **Example 2**:
  - The blue player scores at time 11.
  - The final score is 0-1.
  
- **Example 3**:
  - The blue player scores because the red player scored in their own goal.
  - The final score is 0-1.

The code appears to handle all the cases correctly based on the given examples. There are no obvious logical errors in the code that would lead to incorrect results. The function `func_1` processes the commands and updates the scores and positions correctly. The helper functions `goalIn` and `isPlayer` are used appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
