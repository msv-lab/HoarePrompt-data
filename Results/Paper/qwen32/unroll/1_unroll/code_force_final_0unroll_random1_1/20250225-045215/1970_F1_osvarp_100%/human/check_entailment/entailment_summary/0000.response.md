### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and its functions to ensure that they meet the problem description:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads the grid dimensions, the grid itself, and the number of actions.
   - **Initialization**: It initializes data structures to keep track of positions of players, the Quaffle, goals, and points.
   - **Processing Actions**: For each action, it updates the positions of players, handles catching and throwing the Quaffle, and checks for goals.
   - **Output**: It prints the result of each goal and the final score at the end.

2. **Function `goalIn`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determines if a given position is a goal for the red team, blue team, or neither.
   - **Implementation**: Checks if the position is in the red team's goal list or the blue team's goal list and returns the appropriate team identifier (0 for red, 1 for blue, -1 for neither).

3. **Function `isPlayer`**:
   - **Purpose**: Checks if a given entity is a player.
   - **Implementation**: Returns `True` if the entity identifier starts with 'B' or 'R' and is not followed by 'G'.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Reading and Initializing the Grid**: The code correctly reads the grid and initializes positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
- **Processing Actions**:
  - **Movement**: The code correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the commands.
  - **Catching the Quaffle**: The code correctly identifies when a player catches the Quaffle.
  - **Throwing the Quaffle**: The code correctly identifies when a player throws the Quaffle and checks if the throw results in a goal.
- **Checking for Goals**: The function `goalIn` correctly determines if a position is a goal and returns the appropriate team identifier.
- **Output**: The code prints the result of each goal and the final score at the end.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions together correctly simulate the game according to the problem description. They handle all required actions, check for goals, and output the correct results.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
