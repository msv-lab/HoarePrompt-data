Output State: **`el` is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'; `res` is `True`.**

Explanation: The condition `(el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'` is always `True` given the initial state constraints. The first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R', and the second character is not 'G', so the entire expression evaluates to `True`.
