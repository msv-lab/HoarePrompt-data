In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates over the range `tt`. The loop variable is `ii`, and it will take on values from `0` to `tt-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1. Given that `tt` is already constrained to be in the range 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4, no adjustment is needed for `tt` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Therefore, the only object in the loop head that we need to consider is `ii`, which is the loop variable. Before the loop starts, `ii` is not yet defined, but it will be initialized to `0` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4, `ii` is not yet defined (will be initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration)**

However, since the question asks to specify the state before the loop starts and we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we should specify `ii` as it would be at the start of the first iteration, which is `0`.

State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4, `ii` is 0**
