### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum final score by selecting pairs of integers from the list, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both integers from the list. The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pick the smallest available integers, as this ensures that the smaller number in each pair is as large as possible.

The given program correctly implements this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It then iterates over the sorted list, taking every other element starting from the first (which are the smallest `n` integers in the sorted list).
5. It sums these `n` smallest integers and prints the result as the score for that test case.

The execution summary aligns with the expected behavior of the program, indicating that it correctly calculates and prints the sum of the smallest `n` integers for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
