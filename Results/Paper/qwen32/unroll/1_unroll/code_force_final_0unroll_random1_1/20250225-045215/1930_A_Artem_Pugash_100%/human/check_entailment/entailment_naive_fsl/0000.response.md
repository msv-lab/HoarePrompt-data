Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum final score by always selecting the smallest available numbers in pairs. Here's a breakdown of why the code works as intended:

1. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we iterate through the list with a step of 2, we are always picking the smallest available number in each pair.
   
2. **Iterating with Step of 2**: By iterating through the sorted list with a step of 2 (`for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), we are effectively picking the smallest number in each pair because the list is sorted. Since the list is sorted, the number at index `i` is always the smaller number in the pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`.

3. **Adding to Score**: We add the smaller number of each pair to the score (`score += l[i]`). This ensures that we are maximizing the score by always choosing the smallest available number in each pair.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The outer loop (`for _ in range(int(input()))`) correctly handles multiple test cases by resetting the score and processing each test case independently.

Given these points, the code correctly implements the strategy of always picking the smallest number in each pair to maximize the score, and it handles the input and output requirements as specified in the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios that the code fails to handle correctly based on the provided logic and implementation.
