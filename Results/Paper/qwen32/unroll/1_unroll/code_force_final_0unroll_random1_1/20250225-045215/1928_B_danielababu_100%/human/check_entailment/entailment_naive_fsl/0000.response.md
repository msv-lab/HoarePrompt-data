Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any function that actually solves the problem described. The code includes several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) for input and output operations, but there is no function that performs the required task of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

To solve the problem, we need to implement a function that takes an array `a` and determines the maximum frequency of any number after adding a permutation to `a`. The provided code does not include such a function, and thus it is incorrect for the given problem description.

Here is an example of how the code might look if it were correct:

```python
from collections import Counter

def max_frequency_after_permutation(n, a):
    # Count the frequency of each element in the array
    count = Counter(a)
    
    # The maximum frequency is the maximum value in the counter plus the length of the array
    # because we can add a permutation that makes all elements equal to the most frequent element
    # plus the length of the array.
    max_freq = max(count.values()) + n
    
    return max_freq

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        results.append(max_frequency_after_permutation(n, a))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the main function to execute the code
main()
```

This example code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The original code provided does not include this logic, hence it is incorrect.
