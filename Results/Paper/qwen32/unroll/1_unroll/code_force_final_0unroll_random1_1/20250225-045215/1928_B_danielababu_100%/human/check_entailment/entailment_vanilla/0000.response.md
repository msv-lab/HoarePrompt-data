To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it solves the problem as described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to it. 

Let's break down the problem and the provided code:

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: 
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the array.
   - An array `a` of length `n` with integers.
   
2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation to the array.
   
3. **Approach**:
   - Since we can add any permutation of numbers from 1 to n to the array, the key idea is to try to make as many elements as possible equal by strategically choosing the permutation.
   - The optimal strategy is to try to make the smallest number in the array as large as possible by adding the largest permutation values to it, and similarly for other numbers.
   - The maximum frequency of any number in the modified array will be the answer.

### Analysis of the Provided Code
The provided code includes several functions for input handling and some utility functions, but it does not contain the actual logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` to `func_8` are for different types of input parsing and list manipulations, but none of them implement the core logic for solving the problem.

### Correctness of the Program
Since the provided code does not contain the logic to solve the problem, it cannot be considered correct. The code is incomplete and does not perform the necessary operations to find the maximum frequency of any number in the modified array after adding a permutation.

### Conclusion
The program is not correct because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
