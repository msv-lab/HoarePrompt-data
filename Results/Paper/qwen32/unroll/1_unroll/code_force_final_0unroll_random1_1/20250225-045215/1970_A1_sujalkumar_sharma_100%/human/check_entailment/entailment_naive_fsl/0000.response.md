Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**
The given code has an issue with the function `func_1` being called before its definition. In Python, you need to define a function before you can call it. This will result in a `NameError` because `func_1` is not recognized when the `print(func_1(s))` statement is executed.

To fix this issue, the function `func_1` should be defined before it is called. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result

s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))
```

With this correction, the code should work correctly for the given problem description and example. The logic of the function `func_1` seems to correctly compute the balanced shuffle of the parentheses sequence as described in the problem statement.
