The provided code sorts the `prefix_balance` list based on a specific key. The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, where `x[0]` is the balance and `-x[1]` is the negative of the index `i`. This means the list will first be sorted by the balance in ascending order, and for entries with the same balance, it will be sorted by the index in descending order (since we use the negative of the index).

Since the initial `balance` is 0 for all entries, the sorting will primarily depend on the index in descending order. Therefore, the `prefix_balance` list will be sorted such that the entries with higher indices will come first among those with the same balance.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples (balance, i, s[i]) sorted by balance in ascending order and by index in descending order for entries with the same balance.**
