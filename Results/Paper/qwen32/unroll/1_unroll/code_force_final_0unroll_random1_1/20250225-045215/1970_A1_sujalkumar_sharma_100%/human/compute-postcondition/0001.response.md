The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `prefix_balance`. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of balanced parentheses and `n` is the length of `s`. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is an empty list.**
