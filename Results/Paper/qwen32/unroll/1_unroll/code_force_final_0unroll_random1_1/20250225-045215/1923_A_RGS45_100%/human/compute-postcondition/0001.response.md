The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variables `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not part of the loop head, so they should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The values of `n` and the list of integers are not relevant to the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
