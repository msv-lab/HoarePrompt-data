Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The program checks only the first and last elements of the array for specific conditions, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zero.

Here is a counterexample to show that the program is incorrect:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
Starting with the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, we can perform the following operations:
1. Apply the operation at index 3: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at index 3: `[0, -1, 0, -1, 0]`
3. Apply the operation at index 2: `[-1, -2, -1, -1, 0]`
4. Apply the operation at index 2: `[-2, -3, -2, 0, 0]`
5. Apply the operation at index 2: `[-3, -4, -3, 1, 0]`
6. Apply the operation at index 4: `[-3, -4, -4, -1, 0]`
7. Apply the operation at index 4: `[-3, -4, -5, -2, 0]`
8. Apply the operation at index 4: `[-3, -4, -6, -3, 0]`
9. Apply the operation at index 4: `[-3, -4, -7, -4, 0]`
10. Continue applying the operation at index 4 until all elements are zero.

However, the provided program would incorrectly output "NO" for this input because it only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions that do not apply to this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
