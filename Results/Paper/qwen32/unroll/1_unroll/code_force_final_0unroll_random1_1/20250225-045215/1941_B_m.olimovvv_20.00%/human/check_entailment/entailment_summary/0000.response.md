Reasoning:

The provided program checks for specific conditions related to the first and last elements of the array to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero using the described operations. However, the logic implemented in the program is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

The key point in the problem is that the operation can be applied any number of times, and any index (except the first and last) can be used zero or more times. The problem requires a more comprehensive analysis of the array to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.

The provided program only checks if the first or last element is odd and if the next or previous element is exactly two more. This is not enough to guarantee that the entire array can be reduced to zeros. The correct approach would involve checking if the differences between consecutive elements can be adjusted to zero through the described operations.

For example, the third test case in the example input is `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`. The provided program would incorrectly output 'YES' because it only checks the first and last elements, but it's actually possible to make all elements zero through a series of operations.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
