Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the described operations. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not consider the necessary conditions for transforming the array into all zeros.

The program only checks if the first or last element is odd and if the second or second-to-last element is not exactly 2 more than the first or last element, respectively. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be transformed into zeros.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros by applying the given operations. A valid approach involves checking if the array can be transformed into a sequence where each element can be reduced to zero by the operations, which requires a more detailed analysis of the array's structure and values.
