The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, meaning the number of iterations is determined by the integer value read from the input.

Given the state before the loop starts, the critical factor is the value of `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is at least 1.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. However, since the problem states that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `t` already satisfies this condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes.

The loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted since it is not used within the loop body and its value is automatically managed by the `for` loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
