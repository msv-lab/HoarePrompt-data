Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not account for the correct overlap of fireworks from both installations.

Here's a brief explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Overlap**: The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m` and then uses this to determine the number of fireworks visible from each installation within this time frame. However, this approach does not correctly capture the maximum overlap of fireworks from both installations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Special Cases**: The program includes a special case check for when `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0` and when both `a` and `b` are not equal to 1. This condition does not correctly identify scenarios where the maximum overlap occurs.

3. **Lack of Consideration for Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The problem requires understanding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to correctly determine the overlap of fireworks. The LCM is crucial for determining the periodicity of the fireworks' visibility overlap.

A correct approach involves calculating the number of fireworks visible from each installation up to a certain point (typically the LCM of `a` and `b`), and then determining the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Count fireworks from installation 1 within lcm_ab
        count_a = (lcm_ab + m) // a
        # Count fireworks from installation 2 within lcm_ab
        count_b = (lcm_ab + m) // b
        # Count fireworks from both installations within lcm_ab
        count_both = (lcm_ab + m) // lcm_ab
        
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_fireworks = count_a + count_b - count_both
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, counts the number of fireworks from each installation within this period, and then determines the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.
