Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, both integers where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. If `k` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs an array `ans` starting with 1, 2, and powers of 2 up to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the largest integer such that 2^l < k. It then appends `k - 2^l`, `k + 1`, and additional elements to `ans` following a specific pattern, and returns the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.**
