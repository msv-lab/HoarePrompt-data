d is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, k) representing the parameters for each test case, with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The length of d (number of test cases) is between 1 and 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. processing, da, and rank are additional parameters that are not specified in the problem description and their roles are unclear based on the given information.
