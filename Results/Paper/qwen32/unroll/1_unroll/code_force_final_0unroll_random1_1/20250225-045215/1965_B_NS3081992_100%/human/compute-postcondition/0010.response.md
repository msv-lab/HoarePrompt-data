Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 1.**
