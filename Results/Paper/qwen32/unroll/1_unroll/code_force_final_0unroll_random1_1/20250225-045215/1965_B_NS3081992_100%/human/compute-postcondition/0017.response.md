Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(l-1), k - 2^l, k + 1]`.**

In natural language: The values of `n` and `k` remain as those returned by `func_7()`. The binary string `b` of `n` and its length `l` remain unchanged. Similarly, the binary string `bk` of `k` and its length `lk` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now includes an additional element `k + 1` at the end.
