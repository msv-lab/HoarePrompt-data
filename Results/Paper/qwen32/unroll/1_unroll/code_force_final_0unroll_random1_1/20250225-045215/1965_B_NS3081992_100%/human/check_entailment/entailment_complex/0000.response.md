### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of integers that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
    - `func_7()` reads each test case, which consists of two integers `n` and `k`.
    - `func_15()` iterates through each test case, processes it using `func_14()`, and prints the result.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - `func_14()` processes each test case. It first converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
    - If `k == 1`, it handles this special case by constructing a sequence that avoids the sum `k` and allows all other sums from `1` to `n`.
    - For other values of `k`, it constructs a sequence that avoids the sum `k` while allowing all other sums from `1` to `n`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
    - The sequence is constructed using powers of 2 up to a certain limit.
    - Specific adjustments are made to ensure that the sum `k` cannot be formed but all other sums from `1` to `n` can be formed.
    - The sequence is then converted to a string format and returned.

4. **Output**:
    - The length of the sequence and the sequence itself are printed for each test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the input and constructs the sequence for each test case based on the described logic. The sequence is designed to meet the conditions of not allowing a subsequence to sum to `k` while allowing all other sums from `1` to `n`. The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.

Thus, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
