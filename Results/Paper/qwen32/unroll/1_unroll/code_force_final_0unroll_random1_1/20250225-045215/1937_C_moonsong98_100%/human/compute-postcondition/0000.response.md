The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given that the initial state specifies `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^4`, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the user input, but it must still satisfy the condition `2 <= n <= 10^4` for the input to be valid.

Since the value of `n` is being overwritten by the user input, we do not retain the previous value of `n` in the output state. The other part of the precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, as provided by user input.**
