### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine whether the '1's in a given grid form a square or a triangle based on the count of '1's in each row. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the specific properties of squares and triangles as defined in the problem description.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Square Detection**: For a square, all rows containing '1's should have the same number of '1's. This part of the program is correct.
2. **Triangle Detection**: For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow a specific pattern: the i-th row should have 2*i - 1 '1's, and these '1's should be centered in the grid. The program does not check for this pattern; it only checks if the counts of '1's are different, which is not sufficient to confirm a triangle.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
1. Count the number of '1's in each row.
2. Check if all rows with '1's have the same count to determine if it's a square.
3. If not a square, check if the counts of '1's follow the pattern of a triangle (2*i - 1 for each row).

### Correctness:
Given the flaws in the program's logic, the program is not correct for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
