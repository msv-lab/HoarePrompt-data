grid is a list of lists of characters ('0' or '1'), representing a square grid of size n x n where 2 <= n <= 10. Each test case in the input consists of such a grid, and it is guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square formed by '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1.
