The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 10, and `grid` is an `n x n` list of lists containing only '0's and '1's, with exactly one triangle or square of '1's of size greater than 1.

Since the code only affects the variable `a` and does not modify `t`, `n`, or `grid`, the output state will reflect the new value of `a` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10; `grid` is an n x n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1', containing exactly one triangle or exactly one square of '1's with size greater than 1; `a` is an input integer.**
