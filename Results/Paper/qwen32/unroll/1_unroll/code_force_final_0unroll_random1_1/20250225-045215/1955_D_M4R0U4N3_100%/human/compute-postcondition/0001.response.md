The code snippet initializes a list `cnt_b` with zeros, where the length of the list is `max_val + 1`. Given that `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` will be a list of 1000001 zeros.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `max_val` is 1000000; `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.**
