You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also present in list `b`. The function prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program does not correctly reset the `cnt_b` array between test cases. This means that the frequency counts from previous test cases will carry over to the next test case, leading to incorrect results.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initialization of `cnt_b`**: The `cnt_b` array is initialized once at the beginning of the program and is never reset between test cases. This means that the frequency counts of elements from the previous test case will still be present in `cnt_b` when the next test case starts.

2. **Resetting `cnt_b`**: The program attempts to reset the `cnt_b` array for the elements in `b` at the end of each test case using the line:
   ```python
   for i in b_values:
       cnt_b[i] = 0
   ```
   However, this loop only resets the counts for elements that are present in the current `b` array. If there are elements in `b` from the previous test case that are not in the current `b` array, their counts will remain in `cnt_b`, leading to incorrect results.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
2
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
2
```

**Explanation of the Failure:**
- In the first test case, the counts for `1`, `2`, and `3` are set correctly in `cnt_b`.
- In the second test case, the counts for `1` and `2` are reset to `0` because they are in `b_values`. However, the count for `3` is not reset because `3` is not in the current `b` array. This means that the count for `3` from the first test case remains in `cnt_b`, leading to an incorrect match count for the second test case.

To fix this issue, the `cnt_b` array should be fully reset to `0` at the beginning of each test case, or a new `cnt_b` array should be created for each test case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)  # Reset cnt_b for each test case
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

# func()  # Uncomment to run the function
```

This corrected version ensures that `cnt_b` is reset for each test case, preventing the carryover of counts from previous test cases.
