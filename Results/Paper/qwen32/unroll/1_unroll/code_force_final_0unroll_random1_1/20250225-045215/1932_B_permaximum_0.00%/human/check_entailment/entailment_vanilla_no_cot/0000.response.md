To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it accurately computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules laid out in the problem description.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
2. It initializes a variable `year` to 0, which will keep track of the current year.
3. For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
   - It calculates the next occurrence of the sign by adding to `year` the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year + 1`. This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence is `year + ai`. However, since we want the next occurrence strictly after `year`, we need to add `ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence is the next multiple of `ai` after `year`. This is given by `ai - year % ai` added to `year`, which simplifies to `year + ai - year % ai` or equivalently `year + (ai - year % ai)`. But the expression `year % ai or ai` effectively computes this correctly because `year % ai` is non-zero and thus `year + (ai - year % ai)` is computed.
4. After processing all signs, the program prints the final value of `year`.

The logic of the program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, as described in the problem statement. The use of `year += year % ai or ai` is a concise way to find the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct.
