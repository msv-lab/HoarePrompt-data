Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates a value `year` for each test case based on the list of integers and prints this value. The final state of the program is that it has printed `t` values, one for each test case.**
