### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs every `a_i` years and the next sign can only occur after the previous one. The logic in the program provided seems to correctly implement this requirement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculation of the Year:**
   - The variable `year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program updates the `year` variable:
     - `year += year % ai or ai` is a compact way of saying:
       - If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means the current `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so we need to add the difference to the next multiple of `ai`. This is done by `year += ai - (year % ai)`, which is equivalent to `year += ai - year % ai`.
       - If `year % ai` is zero, it means the current `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign is exactly at `year + ai`. However, the expression `year += year % ai or ai` effectively adds `ai` in this case because `year % ai` is zero, which is treated as `False` in the `or` statement, thus `ai` is added.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all the signs for a test case, the program prints the final `year`.

The provided program correctly handles the logic for determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur by ensuring that each sign appears in the correct sequence and at the correct time. The use of the `year += year % ai or ai` expression is a concise way to find the next occurrence of each sign.
