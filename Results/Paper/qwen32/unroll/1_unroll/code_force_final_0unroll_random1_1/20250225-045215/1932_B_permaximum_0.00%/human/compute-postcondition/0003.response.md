Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer is between 1 and 1,000,000. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided list of integers for each test case.**
