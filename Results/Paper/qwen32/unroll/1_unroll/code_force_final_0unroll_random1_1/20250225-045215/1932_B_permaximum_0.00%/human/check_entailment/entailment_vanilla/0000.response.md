Let's break down the program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign i occurs every `a_i` years, and the next sign can only occur after the previous one.

### Program Analysis:
The given program follows these steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year:**
   - It initializes the `year` to 0.
   - For each sign `ai` in the list:
     - It increments `year` by the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.
     - This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. 
       - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. 
       - If `year % ai` is not zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign will be `year + (ai - year % ai)`, which can be simplified to `year + (ai - (year % ai))` or `year + ai - year % ai`. 
       - If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence is just `year + ai`.
       - The expression `year % ai or ai` effectively does this calculation succinctly:
         - If `year % ai` is non-zero, it uses `ai - year % ai` (since `year % ai` is the remainder, `ai - (year % ai)` gives the increment needed to reach the next multiple of `ai`).
         - If `year % ai` is zero, it uses `ai` directly, meaning `year` is already a multiple of `ai`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the final `year`, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities provided. It handles the sequential occurrence of signs correctly by always waiting for the next sign to occur after the previous one.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
