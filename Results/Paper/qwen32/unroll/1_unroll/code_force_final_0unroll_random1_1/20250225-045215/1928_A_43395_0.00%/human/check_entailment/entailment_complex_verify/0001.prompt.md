You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: A series of 'yes' or 'no' based on the input test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It then prints 'yes' if the rectangle can be divided into smaller rectangles of equal size where each smaller rectangle has both dimensions as even numbers, or if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the given program is correct.

**Problem Understanding:**
Bob can cut his rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then tries to form a new rectangle using the two smaller rectangles. The key point is that the new rectangle must have different dimensions than the original one (considering rotations as the same).

**Key Observations:**
- If either dimension is 1, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because the only possible smaller rectangles would be 1x1, and no new rectangle can be formed.
- If both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle (e.g., from 2x4, cut into two 2x2, form 4x2).
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, Bob can form a new rectangle (e.g., from 2x3, cut into two 2x1.5, form 3x2).
- If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles will be of the form odd x 1, and no new rectangle can be formed that is different from the original.

**Code Analysis:**
Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

- The first condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` correctly identifies that if both dimensions are even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
- The second condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. It seems to be trying to check if the dimensions are the same, but the logic is flawed. This condition doesn't correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd, which should result in "no".
- The third condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is incorrect. It will always evaluate to true for any non-zero difference between a and b because `(a - b) % 2` will either be 1 or -1, which is neither > 0 nor < 0 in the way intended.
- The `else` condition is a fallback, but due to the incorrect conditions above, it may not be reached correctly.

**Conclusion:**
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the second and third conditions. Specifically, the second condition does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd, and the third condition is incorrectly structured.

**Correctness:**
Correctness: **False**
