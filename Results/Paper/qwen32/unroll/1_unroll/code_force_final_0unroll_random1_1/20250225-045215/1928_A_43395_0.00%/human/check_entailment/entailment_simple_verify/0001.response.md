Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap

Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles of integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The goal is to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle with different dimensions (considering rotations as the same).

### Key Observations

1. **Both dimensions are even**: Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle.
2. **One dimension is even and the other is odd**: Bob can form a new rectangle.
3. **Both dimensions are odd**: Bob cannot form a new rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles will be of the form odd x 1, and no new rectangle can be formed that is different from the original.

### Code Analysis

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Annotations and Flaws

- **First Condition**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` 
  - This correctly identifies that if both dimensions are even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
  
- **Second Condition**: `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`
  - This condition is incorrect. It seems to be trying to check if the dimensions are the same, but the logic is flawed. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` will always evaluate to a tuple `(False, a)` or `(True, a)`, which is not what is intended. This condition does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd, which should result in "no".
  
- **Third Condition**: `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`
  - This condition is incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0, 1, or -1. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will always evaluate to `True` for any non-zero difference between `a` and `b` because `(a - b) % 2` will either be 1 or -1. This means that the condition does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd, which should result in "no".

- **Else Condition**: 
  - This is a fallback, but due to the incorrect conditions above, it may not be reached correctly.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed logic in the second and third conditions. Specifically:

- The second condition does not correctly identify when both dimensions are odd.
- The third condition incorrectly evaluates to `True` for any non-zero difference between `a` and `b`.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form a new rectangle for all cases.

**Final: False**
