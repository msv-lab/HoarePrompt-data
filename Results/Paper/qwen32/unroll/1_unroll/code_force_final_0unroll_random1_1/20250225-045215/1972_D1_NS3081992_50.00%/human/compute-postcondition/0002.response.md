The code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `i`, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, where `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`. `i` is 1. `ans` is 0.**
