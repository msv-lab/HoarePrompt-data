### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a permutation of length \( n \) with a specific Manhattan value \( k \). The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element in the permutation and its position in the sorted order. The provided solution involves several functions to achieve this.

1. **Function `func_4`:** 
   - Reads input values \( n \) and \( k \).
   - Checks if \( k \) is even. If not, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation can be constructed.
   - Calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \). This is determined by the formula:
     - \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if \( n \) is odd.
     - \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2}{2} \) if \( n \) is even.
   - If \( k \) exceeds this maximum value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the tuple `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_6`:**
   - Calls `func_4` to get the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is 0 (indicating an invalid case from `func_4`), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation.
   - Finally, it calls `func_5(l)` to print the resulting permutation.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Takes \( n \) and \( k \) as input.
   - Halves \( k \) because the algorithm works with half the Manhattan value.
   - Initializes a list `l` as a permutation from 1 to \( n \).
   - Iterates in reverse from \( n \) down to 1, adjusting the permutation based on the value of \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is reduced to zero, it returns the current permutation.
   - If \( k \) is less than \( i - 1 \) at any point, it calls `func_2` to make a specific swap.
   - It also calls `func_3` to swap elements in each iteration.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Takes \( c \), \( k \), and the list `l`.
   - Swaps elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - Takes \( c \) and the list `l`.
   - Swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`.

6. **Function `func_5`:**
   - Takes a list `l` and prints it as a space-separated string, prefixed by "YES".

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_4`:** It correctly handles the constraints and edge cases by checking if \( k \) is even and whether it exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
- **Correctness of `func_6`:** It correctly delegates the tasks to `func_4`, `func_1`, and `func_5` based on the input values.
- **Correctness of `func_1`:** It constructs the permutation by iteratively adjusting the list based on the value of \( k \). The algorithm seems designed to incrementally build a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
- **Correctness of `func_2` and `func_3`:** These functions perform the necessary swaps to adjust the permutation as required by `func_1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a permutation with the given Manhattan value exists and constructs such a permutation if possible. The functions work together to achieve the desired result as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
