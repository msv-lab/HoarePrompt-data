### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic of the game and the provided solution in detail.

#### Game Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns, with Alice starting.
   - On each turn, a player can optionally swap wallets with the opponent.
   - Then, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when their wallet has zero coins) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - The game is symmetric and the first player (Alice) can force a win or a loss based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`.

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice to lose.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, ensuring Alice's win.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program consists of two functions:
  - `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
  - `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

- **Logic in `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the function returns `'Bob'`, indicating Bob wins.
  - Otherwise, it returns `'Alice'`, indicating Alice wins.

This logic aligns with the winning strategy derived from the game analysis.

#### Validation Using Annotations:
The annotations describe the program's behavior at key points:
- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - Before the function call: `a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`.
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the function returns `'Bob'`.
  - Otherwise, it returns `'Alice'`.
- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, reads `a` and `b`.
  - Calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner and stores the result.
  - Prints the results for all test cases.

The annotations confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total number of coins `(a + b)`. The annotations support the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
