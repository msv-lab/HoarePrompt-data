### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight of the problem, which is that the winner of the game can be determined by the parity of the total number of coins \(a + b\). Specifically:

- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins.
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins.

The provided program implements this logic accurately in `func_1(a, b)`, which checks the parity of \(a + b\) and returns the correct winner. The `func_2()` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input, processing each test case with `func_1`, and printing the results.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly processes the inputs and produces the expected outputs based on the described logic. The annotations show that the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns 'Bob' when \(a + b\) is even and 'Alice' when \(a + b\) is odd. Similarly, `func_2()` correctly collects and prints the results for each test case.

Thus, the program correctly implements the game logic and handles all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
