### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins \(a + b\). Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis:**
   - If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins.
   - If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins.

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)`:**
   - This function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of \(a + b\).
   - If \(a + b\) is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If \(a + b\) is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This matches the key insight derived from the game analysis.

3. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_2`, which reads inputs, determines the winner using `func_1`, and prints the results.

5. **Validation Against Example:**
   - The example provided in the problem description is consistent with the program's logic.
   - For the test case `1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), so the output is 'Bob'.
   - For the test case `1 4`, the sum is 5 (odd), so the output is 'Alice'.
   - This matches the expected outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins and handles multiple test cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
