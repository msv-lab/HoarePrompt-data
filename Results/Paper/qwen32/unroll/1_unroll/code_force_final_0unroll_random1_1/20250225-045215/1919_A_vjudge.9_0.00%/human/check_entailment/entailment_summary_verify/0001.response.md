To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the game rules, the program logic, and the function summaries systematically.

### Game Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns, with Alice starting.
   - On each turn, a player can optionally swap wallets with the opponent.
   - Then, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when their wallet has zero coins) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - The critical insight is that swapping wallets does not change the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice to lose.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, ensuring Alice's win.

### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns `'Bob'`.
  - Otherwise, it returns `'Alice'`.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
  - Uses `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
  - Prints the result for each test case.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It then determines the winner based on the logic implemented in `func_1` and prints the result for each test case.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct based on the game analysis. The parity of the total number of coins `(a + b)` determines the winner.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles input and output for multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the consistent alignment between the game analysis and the logic implemented in the program, the program is correct. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
