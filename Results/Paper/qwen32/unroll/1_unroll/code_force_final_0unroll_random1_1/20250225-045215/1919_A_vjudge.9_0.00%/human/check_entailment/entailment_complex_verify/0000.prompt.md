You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns the string 'Bob'
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range of 1 to 10^9. It returns the string 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and the string 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: results is a list of length t, where each element is the result of func_1(a, b) for the corresponding test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: results is a list of length t, where each element is the result of func_1(a, b) for the corresponding test case, and each result has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It then determines the winner based on the logic implemented in `func_1` and prints the result for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and verify if it correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight
The game can be analyzed by considering the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins \(a + b\):
- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins.
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation
- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move, assuming both play optimally. This is because she will always be the one to make the last move that results in an odd number of coins, and Bob will always be able to make a move that results in an even number of coins.
- Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he cannot make a move.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the parity of \(a + b\).
2. `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'
```
- This function correctly implements the key insight: it checks if the sum of coins \(a + b\) is even or odd and returns the appropriate winner.

#### Function `func_2()`
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
- This function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all potential cases based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins \(a + b\). It handles multiple test cases and provides the correct output for every possible scenario.
