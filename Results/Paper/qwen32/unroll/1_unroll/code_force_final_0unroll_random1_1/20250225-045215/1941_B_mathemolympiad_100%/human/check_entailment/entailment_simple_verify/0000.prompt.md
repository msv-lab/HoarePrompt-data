You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        stop = False
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        if stop == True:
            continue
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:

    #State: After processing all test cases, `numTest` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `a` are modified for each test case based on the operations performed, and the output for each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Operations**: The program attempts to reduce the array elements by performing operations starting from the beginning of the array. However, it does not handle the possibility of having to perform operations from different indices multiple times or in a different order. The operations can be performed on any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) any number of times, and the program does not account for this flexibility.

2. **Handling of Negative Values**: The program checks if any element becomes negative during the operations and immediately prints "NO" if it does. While it is true that negative values indicate an invalid state, the program does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero even if no negative values are encountered.

3. **Final Check**: After performing the operations, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. However, it does not ensure that all elements are zero. The program should check if all elements in the array are zero after attempting to reduce them.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
2 4 4 4 2
```
The correct output should be "YES" because the operations can be applied as follows:
- Apply the operation at `i=2`: [2, 2, 2, 4, 2]
- Apply the operation at `i=2`: [2, 0, 0, 2, 2]
- Apply the operation at `i=3`: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- Apply the operation at `i=1`: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, the provided program will not correctly handle this case because it does not perform the operations in an optimal or flexible manner.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases and does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero using the described operations.
