Output State: **`numTest` is an integer input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `numTest` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) and their preconditions remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
