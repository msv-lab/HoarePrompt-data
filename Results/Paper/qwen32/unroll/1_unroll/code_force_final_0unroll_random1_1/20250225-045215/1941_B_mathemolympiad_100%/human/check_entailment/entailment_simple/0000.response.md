### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each element of the array (except the last two) and performing the specified operation to reduce the values. However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The program uses `opNum = a[i]` and then subtracts `opNum`, `2 * opNum`, and `opNum` from `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` respectively. This approach is flawed because it assumes that `a[i]` can be fully reduced to zero in one step, which is not necessarily true. The operation can only be applied if `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` have sufficient values to accommodate the subtraction without going negative.

2. **Negative Values Check**: The program checks if any element becomes negative after the operation, but it does not ensure that the operation is valid (i.e., that `a[i + 1] >= 2 * opNum` and `a[i + 2] >= opNum`). This check is insufficient to guarantee the correctness of the solution.

3. **Final Check**: The program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero, but it does not ensure that all elements in the array are zero. This is a critical oversight because the problem requires all elements to be zero, not just the last two.

4. **Logical Flow**: The program's logic does not correctly simulate the process of reducing the array to zero. A correct approach would involve checking if the array can be reduced to zero by simulating the operation in a way that respects the constraints and ensures all elements can be made zero.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

**Correctness: False**
