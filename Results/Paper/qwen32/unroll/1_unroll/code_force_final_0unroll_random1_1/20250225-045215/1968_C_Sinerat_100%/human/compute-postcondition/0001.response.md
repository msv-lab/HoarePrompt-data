To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand how the given code processes each test case.

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - An integer `n` is read, which represents the length of the list `a`.
   - A list `x` of `n-1` integers is read.
   - A list `a` of length `n` is initialized with all elements set to `0`.
   - The first element of `a` is set to `1000`.
   - The subsequent elements of `a` are computed by adding the corresponding elements of `x` to the previous element of `a`.
   - The list `a` is then printed.

The output state after all iterations will be the printed lists `a` for each test case. Since the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `x` is reset for each test case, the final output state will be a series of printed lists `a` corresponding to each test case.

Given the format requirement, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **For each test case, a list `a` of length `n` where `a[0]` is `1000` and `a[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n-1` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**
