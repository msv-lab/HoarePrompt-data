The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it generates and prints a list `a` of length `n` where the first element is `1000` and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
