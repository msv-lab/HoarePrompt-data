To determine the output state after executing the loop for all test cases, we need to analyze how the loop processes each test case and what it prints based on the conditions given.

The loop iterates over each test case, which consists of two integers, `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions involving `k` and `n`. Here is a breakdown of the conditions:

1. If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
2. If `k == 4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`.
3. If `k == 4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`.

The loop processes each test case independently and prints the result for each one. The output state will be the concatenation of all these printed results, one per line.

Since the problem specifies that the first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, the loop will process exactly `t` test cases. The output state will thus consist of `t` lines, each containing the result of the corresponding test case.

Given that the loop does not modify any global state or variables outside of its scope, and it only prints results based on the input, the output state is simply the sequence of outputs for each test case.

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is the sequence of results printed for each test case, one per line.

Output State: **the sequence of results printed for each test case, one per line.**
