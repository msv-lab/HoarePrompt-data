You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
def func():

        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: the sequence of results printed for each test case, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of a square grid and an integer `k` representing the minimum number of diagonals that should contain at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition on `k` diagonals.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the solution fails to account for all edge cases and the correct logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color.

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
```

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The provided code attempts to handle this by checking specific conditions for `k`:

1. If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
2. If `k == 4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`.
3. If `k == 4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`.

However, this logic is not correct for all values of `k`. For example, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 5
```

According to the problem description, we need to color cells such that at least 5 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The correct answer for this case is 3, as we can color cells (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) to cover 5 diagonals. However, the provided code will output `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`, which is correct for this specific case, but the logic is not robust for all cases.

Let's consider another test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 6
```

The correct answer for this case is 3 as well, but the provided code will output `math.ceil(6 / 2) = 3`, which is correct for this specific case, but the logic is not robust for all cases.

However, let's consider a more complex test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 10
```

The correct answer for this case is 5, as we can color cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), and (1,4) to cover 10 diagonals. However, the provided code will output `math.ceil(10 / 2) = 5`, which is correct for this specific case, but the logic is not robust for all cases.

The provided code does not handle the general case correctly, especially when `k` is close to `4 * n - 2`. The logic needs to be more comprehensive to handle all possible values of `k` correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
