You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of 2x2 grids required to cover all the icons.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding

- We have screens of size 5 x 3 (15 cells).
- We have two types of icons: 
  - 1x1 icons (occupy 1 cell each)
  - 2x2 icons (occupy 4 cells each)
- We need to place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (x) and 2x2 icons (y).

#### Key Steps in the Program

1. `z = (y + 1) // 2`
   - This line calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the 2x2 icons. The formula `(y + 1) // 2` effectively rounds up `y / 2` because it needs to account for any leftover 2x2 icons that can't fill a screen completely.

2. `m = 15 * z - y * 4`
   - This line calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. `15 * z` is the total number of cells on `z` screens, and `y * 4` is the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons. The difference `m` is the number of cells left for 1x1 icons.

3. `if m < x:`
   - This condition checks if the remaining cells `m` are less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`. If true, it means we need additional screens for the 1x1 icons.

4. `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`
   - If the condition is true, this line calculates how many more screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` effectively rounds up `(x - m) / 15` to determine the additional screens required.

5. `print(z)`
   - This line outputs the total number of screens needed for the current test case.

### Checking the Program with Sample Input

Let's test the program with the sample input provided:

1. **Input:** 1 1
   - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
   - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
   - `m >= x` (11 >= 1), so no additional screens are needed.
   - **Output:** 1 (Correct)

2. **Input:** 7 2
   - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`

   - `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`
   - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 14`

   - **Output:** 2 (Correct)

5. **Input:** 1 0
   - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
   - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`

   - `z = 0 + (1 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0 + 15 // 15 = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Output:** 1 (Correct)

6. **Input:** 8 1
   - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
   - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
   - `m >= x` (11 >= 8), so no additional screens are needed.
   - **Output:** 1 (Correct)

7. **Input:** 0 0
   - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
   - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `m >= x` (0 >= 0), so no additional screens are needed.
   - **Output:** 0 (Correct)

8. **Input:** 2 0
   - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
   - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `m < x` (0 < 2), so additional screens are needed.
   - `z = 0 + (2 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0 + 16 // 15 = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Output:** 1 (Correct)

9. **Input:** 15 0
   - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
   - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `m < x` (0 < 15), so additional screens are needed.
   - `z = 0 + (15 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0 + 29 // 15 = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Output:** 1 (Correct)

10. **Input:** 8 2
    - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
    - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
    - `m < x` (7 < 8), so additional screens are needed.
    - `z = 1 + (8 - 7 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1 + 15 // 15 = 1 + 1 = 2`
    - **Output:** 2 (Correct)

11. **Input:** 0 9
    - `z = (9 + 1) // 2 = 5`
    - `m = 15 * 5 - 9 * 4 = 15`
    - `m >= x` (15 >= 0), so no additional screens are needed.
    - **Output:** 5 (Correct)
