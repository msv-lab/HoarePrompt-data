The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `custos`. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or `x`). The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each `i`. `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9 for each `i`. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `x` is an input integer. `custos` is an empty list.**
