The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the elements of the list `custos`. For the loop to execute, the list `custos` must contain at least one element. The initial state of `c` does not need to be set because it will be assigned the first element of `custos` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `custos` has at least one integer.

State: **`custos` is a list of integers where each integer is the computed cost for each test case and `custos` must have at least 1 integer**.
