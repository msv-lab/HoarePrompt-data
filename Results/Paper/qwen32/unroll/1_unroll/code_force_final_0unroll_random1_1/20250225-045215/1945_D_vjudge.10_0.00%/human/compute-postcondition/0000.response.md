Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each `i`. `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9 for each `i`. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `x` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the variable `x` has been assigned the value of an input integer, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial values and constraints.
