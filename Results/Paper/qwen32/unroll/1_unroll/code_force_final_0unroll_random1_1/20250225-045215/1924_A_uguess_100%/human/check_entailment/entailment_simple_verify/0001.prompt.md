You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)

    #State: `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are the values from the last test case; `cnt` is the number of complete sequences of `k` unique characters found in `s`; `cur` is the bitmask representing the last set of characters seen before the loop ended; `ans` is the constructed string if `cnt` is less than `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`.
- If not, we need to output a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Checking Subsequences:**
   - The program initializes `cnt` to count complete subsequences and `cur` to track the current subsequence.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`, updating `cur` to reflect the inclusion of the character if it hasn't been included yet.
   - When `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1` (indicating that all `k` characters have been seen in the correct order), it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.

3. **Determining the Result:**
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that is not a subsequence.

4. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program constructs a string by appending the first character that hasn't been included and then appending 'a' (`n - cnt - 1`) times.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Counting Subsequences:** The program does not correctly count all possible subsequences of length `n`. It only counts the number of times all `k` characters appear in order, which does not equate to all possible subsequences of length `n`.
- **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:** The approach to construct a missing subsequence is flawed. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
