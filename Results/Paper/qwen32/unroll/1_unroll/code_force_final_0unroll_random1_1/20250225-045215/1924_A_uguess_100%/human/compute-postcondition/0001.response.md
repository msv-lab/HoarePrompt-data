The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because the `range(t)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` does not need to be specified because it is automatically initialized by the `range` function. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**
