The code snippet `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The string `s` consists of characters `<` and `>`, but the specific sequence and length of `s` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only express the length of `s` as `len(s)`.

Since the length of `s` is now stored in `n`, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial description of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`**.
