You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.

        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: For each of the `t` lines, the output will be either `k // 2 + 1` if `k == 4 * n - 2`, or `(k + 1) // 2` otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for all cases. Let's analyze the logic and identify a case where it fails.

The program uses the formula `ceil(k / 2)` to determine the minimum number of cells to color, except when `k == 4n - 2`, in which case it prints `k // 2 + 1`. However, this approach does not account for the actual structure of the diagonals in an `n x n` grid.

### Analysis of the Program Logic
1. **Diagonal Structure**: In an `n x n` grid, there are `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and `2n - 1` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left, making a total of `4n - 2` diagonals.
2. **Coloring Strategy**: To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell, the strategy should consider the overlap of diagonals. For example, coloring a single cell at the center of the grid can cover multiple diagonals.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 5`:

- The grid is a 3x3 grid, which has `4 * 3 - 2 = 10` diagonals.
- We need to color cells such that at least 5 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The program calculates `ceil(5 / 2) = 3`, but this is not optimal.

### Optimal Coloring for `n = 3` and `k = 5`
By coloring the center cell (position (2, 2) in a 1-based index), we can cover 4 diagonals (one main diagonal and three others). We need to color one more cell to cover the fifth diagonal. So, the optimal solution is 2 cells, not 3.

### Another Counterexample
Let's consider `n = 4` and `k = 7`:

- The grid is a 4x4 grid, which has `4 * 4 - 2 = 14` diagonals.
- We need to color cells such that at least 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The program calculates `ceil(7 / 2) = 4`, but this is not optimal.

### Optimal Coloring for `n = 4` and `k = 7`
By coloring the center two cells (positions (2, 2) and (3, 3) in a 1-based index), we can cover 7 diagonals. So, the optimal solution is 2 cells, not 4.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the optimal coloring strategy for all cases. It fails to consider the overlap of diagonals and the minimal number of cells required to cover the required diagonals. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
