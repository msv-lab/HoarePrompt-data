Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify some potential cases where it fails.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Matches**: The code calculates `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`, which is correct. However, it then checks if `total_matchs > 3` which is incorrect. The maximum number of matches is not restricted to 3, as the problem does not specify a limit on the number of games played.

2. **Incorrect Check for Valid Scores**: The code checks if `p3 > total_matchs`, which is incorrect. The score `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` if there are draws. The correct check should be based on the feasibility of the scores, not just this simple comparison.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**: The formula for calculating `egalites` (draws) is incorrect. The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not correctly account for the distribution of wins and draws. It does not ensure that the calculated number of draws is feasible given the scores.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle some edge cases correctly. For example, when `p1 == p2 == p3`, the maximum number of draws should be calculated differently.

### Example of Failure:
Let's consider the test case `(1, 1, 2)`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws is 2. However, the provided code calculates it as 0.

Here is how the code executes for this test case:
- `total_points = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
- `total_matchs = 4 // 2 = 2`
- `egalites = 4 - 2 * (2 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 1) = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0`

Thus, the code incorrectly returns 0 instead of 2 for this test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
