`The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values in the given code snippet.`
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
