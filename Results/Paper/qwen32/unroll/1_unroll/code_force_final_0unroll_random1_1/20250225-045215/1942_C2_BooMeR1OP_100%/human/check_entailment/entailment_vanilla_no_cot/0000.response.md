Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Handling of Gaps**:
   - The logic for handling gaps between chosen vertices is flawed. The program attempts to sort odd and even gaps separately and then process them, but it does not correctly account for the number of additional vertices `y` that can be chosen to maximize the number of triangles.

2. **Counting Triangles**:
   - The program incorrectly counts the number of triangles. The logic for counting triangles by checking adjacent vertices and gaps does not accurately reflect the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the gaps between vertices are small or where the number of additional vertices `y` is very limited.

4. **Sorting and Processing Gaps**:
   - The program sorts the odd and even gaps separately and processes them in a way that does not guarantee the maximum number of triangles. Specifically, the program does not correctly prioritize which gaps to fill first to maximize the number of triangles.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible approach involves using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to carefully select the additional vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles. The program should also correctly handle the constraints and edge cases specified in the problem statement.
