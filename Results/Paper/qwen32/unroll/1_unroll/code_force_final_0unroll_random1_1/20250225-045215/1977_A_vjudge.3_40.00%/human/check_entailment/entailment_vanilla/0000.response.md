Let's analyze the problem statement and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add one cube to the tower.
2. Remove one cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
- After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can range from `0` (if all moves are removals) to `n` (if all moves are additions).
- The difference between the number of additions and removals must equal `m`.
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
- If `m` is less than `0`, it is impossible because the minimum number of cubes that can be in the tower is `0`.
- If `m` is equal to `n`, it is possible if all moves are additions.
- If `m` is less than `n`, it is possible if the difference between the number of additions and removals equals `m`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Program:
Let's go through the logic in the provided program:

1. **If `n == m`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if `n` moves are all additions, we end up with `m` cubes.
   
2. **If `m > n`:**
   - The program outputs "No", which is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   
3. **If `m == n - 1`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because we can add `n-1` cubes and remove `1` cube.
   
4. **If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by having an equal number of additions and removals that result in an even number of cubes.
   
5. **If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if both `m` and `n` are odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by having an equal number of additions and removals that result in an odd number of cubes.
   
6. **Else:**
   - The program outputs "No", which is correct because if the parity (odd/even nature) of `m` and `n` do not match, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes with `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement and the observations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
