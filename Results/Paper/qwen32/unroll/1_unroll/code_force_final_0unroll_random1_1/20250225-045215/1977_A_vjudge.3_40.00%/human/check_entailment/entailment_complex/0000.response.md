### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. The logic in the provided code needs to be analyzed to see if it correctly implements this logic.

Here's a breakdown of the conditions in the code and whether they correctly determine the possibility:

1. **If `n == m`:**
   - This condition correctly identifies that if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, one way to achieve this is by adding one cube per move. Hence, it prints "Yes".
   
2. **If `m > n`:**
   - This condition correctly identifies that it's impossible to have more cubes than moves since each move can only add or remove one cube. Hence, it prints "No".
   
3. **If `m == n - 1`:**
   - This condition correctly identifies that if the number of cubes is one less than the number of moves, one way to achieve this is by adding one cube per move except for one move where a cube is removed. Hence, it prints "Yes".
   
4. **If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition incorrectly assumes that if both `n` and `m` are even, it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, if `n = 4` and `m = 2`, it's possible, but if `n = 4` and `m = 0`, it's not possible because we can't end up with 0 cubes after 4 moves with the given rules.
   
5. **If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:**
   - Similar to the previous condition, this incorrectly assumes that if both `n` and `m` are odd, it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. This is also not necessarily true. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, it's possible, but if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it's not possible because we can't end up with 3 cubes after 5 moves with the given rules.
   
6. **Else:**
   - This condition prints "No" if none of the above conditions are met.

### Conclusion:

The conditions related to parity (even/odd) are not correctly implemented. The correct condition should be that the difference `n - m` should be even, which means that the number of moves to add cubes minus the number of moves to remove cubes should be even. This is because each pair of adding and removing a cube results in no net change, and any remaining moves should be all additions or all removals, which means the difference must be even.

### Correctness:

Given the incorrect conditions related to parity, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
