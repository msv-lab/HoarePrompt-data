To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the output based on the input values `n` and `m`.

The loop reads `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m` from the input. For each pair, it performs the following checks in order:
1. If `n` is equal to `m`, it prints 'Yes'.
2. If `m` is greater than `n`, it prints 'No'.
3. If `m` is equal to `n - 1`, it prints 'Yes'.
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints 'Yes'.
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints 'Yes'.
6. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.

The output state after the loop will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses corresponding to each pair of `n` and `m` read from the input.

Since the specific values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot produce a specific sequence of 'Yes' and 'No'. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the conditions that determine each output.

Output State: **A series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each pair of `n` and `m`, determined by the conditions specified in the loop.**
