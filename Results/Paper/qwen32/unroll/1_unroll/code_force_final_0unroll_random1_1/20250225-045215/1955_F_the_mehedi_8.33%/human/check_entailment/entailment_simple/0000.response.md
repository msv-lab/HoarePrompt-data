To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The core of the problem is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, which occurs when the XOR of all remaining numbers in the sequence is zero. Eve removes one number at a time, and her goal is to maximize Bob's wins.

### Key Observations

1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Conditions**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.

3. **Number Contributions to XOR**:
   - 1 contributes 001 in binary.
   - 2 contributes 010 in binary.
   - 3 contributes 011 in binary.
   - 4 contributes 100 in binary.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers have a XOR of zero as many times as possible.
   - If the count of a specific number is odd, removing one instance of that number can change the parity of the XOR.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should balance the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position (0th, 1st, and 2nd positions).

### Program Analysis

The provided program considers the following:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, Bob wins once initially. This is because the XOR of an equal number of 1s, 2s, and 3s (all odd counts) results in zero.
   
2. **Counting Half of Each Number**:
   - For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), Eve can remove half of them (rounded down) to ensure that the remaining counts of each type are even. This helps in balancing the XOR across the sequence.

3. **Summing Up**:
   - The total count of Bob's wins is the sum of the initial check (1 if the condition is met) and the number of times Eve can remove half of each type of number.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Counts: 1 one, 1 two, 1 three, 0 four.
   - Initial check: Counts of 1, 2, and 3 are equal and odd, so Bob wins once.
   - Result: 1

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Counts: 1 one, 0 two, 1 three, 2 four.
   - Initial check: Counts of 1 and 3 are equal and odd, so Bob wins once.
   - Result: 1

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Counts: 2 ones, 2 twos, 2 threes, 0 fours.
   - Initial check: Counts of 1, 2, and 3 are even, so no initial win for Bob.
   - Eve can remove half of each type: 1 one, 1 two, 1 three.
   - Result: 3

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Counts: 3 ones, 3 twos, 2 threes, 0 fours.
   - Initial check: Counts of 1 and 2 are equal and odd, so Bob wins once.
   - Eve can remove half of each type: 1 one, 1 two, 1 three.
   - Result: 3

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Counts: 0 ones, 9 twos, 9 threes, 9 fours.
   - Initial check: Counts of 2, 3, and 4 are equal and odd, so Bob wins once.
   - Eve can remove half of each type: 4 twos, 4 threes, 4 fours.
   - Result: 12

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the initial condition for equal odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s, and by calculating the number of times Eve can remove half of each type of number.

**Correctness: True**
