Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
The game is played on a sequence of integers, each of which can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero, otherwise Bob wins. Eve removes one number at a time until the sequence is empty, aiming to maximize Bob's wins.

### Key Observations:
1. XOR of a sequence is 0 if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.
2. Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can analyze the XOR for each bit position (0th and 1st bit):
   - 1 = 01 (binary)
   - 2 = 10 (binary)
   - 3 = 11 (binary)
   - 4 = 100 (binary)
3. For the XOR to be zero, the counts of 1s and 3s (which flip the 0th bit) must be even, and the counts of 2s and 4s (which flip the 1st bit) must be even.
4. Eve can remove numbers optimally to make the counts even, thus ensuring Bob wins.

### Strategy:
- If the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are all even, Bob can win with the full sequence.
- If any count is odd, Eve can remove one number to make it even, ensuring Bob wins for the reduced sequence.
- Eve can aim to create sequences with even counts for as many rounds as possible.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd. If so, Bob can win once with the full sequence.
2. For each count (of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s), it adds the floor division of the count by 2 to `cnt`. This represents the number of times Bob can win by making the counts even through Eve's optimal removals.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. It handles the conditions correctly and calculates the result as per the described logic.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
