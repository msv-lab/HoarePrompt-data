To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the code and understand what it does for each test case.

The code snippet processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \).
2. It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
3. It checks if \( p_1 = p_2 = p_3 \) and if this common value is odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1.
4. It then iterates over each of the four integers and adds the floor division of each integer by 2 to `cnt`.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

Let's break down the steps for a generic test case with integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \):

- If \( p_1 = p_2 = p_3 \) and this value is odd, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- For each of the four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \), the floor division by 2 is added to `cnt`. This means:
  - For \( p_1 \), \( \text{math.floor}(p_1 / 2) \) is added to `cnt`.
  - For \( p_2 \), \( \text{math.floor}(p_2 / 2) \) is added to `cnt`.
  - For \( p_3 \), \( \text{math.floor}(p_3 / 2) \) is added to `cnt`.
  - For \( p_4 \), \( \text{math.floor}(p_4 / 2) \) is added to `cnt`.

The final value of `cnt` for each test case is printed. Since the loop processes each test case independently, the output state after all iterations is simply a series of printed values of `cnt` for each test case.

However, the question asks for the output state in a format similar to the initial execution state. Since the output is a series of printed values and not a single state of variables, we can describe it as a series of integers, one for each test case.

Given the format requirement, we can state the output as a list of results for each test case. However, without specific test cases, we can't provide concrete values. The output state format would be a list of results for each test case.

Since the problem doesn't provide specific test cases, we can't compute exact numerical values. But we can describe the format of the output state:

Output State: **a list of integers, each representing the final value of `cnt` for each test case.**

If we hypothetically had test cases, we could compute the exact values. For example, if the test cases were:
- \( p_1 = 1, p_2 = 1, p_3 = 1, p_4 = 0 \)
- \( p_1 = 2, p_2 = 2, p_3 = 2, p_4 = 2 \)

The output would be:
- For the first test case: \( cnt = 1 + \text{math.floor}(1/2) + \text{math.floor}(1/2) + \text{math.floor}(1/2) + \text{math.floor}(0/2) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \)
- For the second test case: \( cnt = 0 + \text{math.floor}(2/2) + \text{math.floor}(2/2) + \text{math.floor}(2/2) + \text{math.floor}(2/2) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \)

So the output state would be:
Output State: **[1, 4]**

Since no specific test cases are provided, the final answer in the required format is:
Output State: **a list of integers, each representing the final value of `cnt` for each test case.**
