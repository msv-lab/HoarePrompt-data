### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires dividing the numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share any bit in their 31 least significant bits. The function seems to be counting the number of unique numbers with odd counts, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function is incorrect:

1. **Misunderstanding the Problem:**
   - The problem is about grouping numbers based on their bit representation (specifically the 31 least significant bits).
   - The function, however, focuses on counting the occurrences of numbers and determining how many appear an odd number of times.

2. **Incorrect Approach:**
   - The function uses bitwise operations to XOR each number with `((1 << 31) - 1)`, which is a bitmask with the 31 least significant bits set to 1. This operation inverts the bits of the number, but it doesn't help in grouping numbers based on the condition provided.
   - The function then counts the occurrences of these inverted numbers. If a number appears an odd number of times, it increments the result.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves using a bitmask to track the groups of numbers based on their bit patterns.
   - One possible solution is to use a bitmask to represent the groups and a dictionary to track which numbers have been placed in which groups.

### Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly solve the problem as described. It counts the number of unique numbers with odd counts, which is not the required solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
