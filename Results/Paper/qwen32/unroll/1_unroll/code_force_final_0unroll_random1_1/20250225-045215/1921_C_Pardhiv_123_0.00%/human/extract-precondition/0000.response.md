Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains four integers n, f, a, and b such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9. The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
