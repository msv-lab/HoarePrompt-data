The function `func_1` reads input values for the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. It then checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` complete sets of `k` unique letters. If it does, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and attempts to construct and print a string of length `n` using the letters found in `s` and additional 'a' characters to meet the length requirement.
