The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the given problem description. It processes each test case, calculates the year for each sign to occur sequentially, and then outputs the final year for each test case. The logic for finding the next occurrence of a sign after the current year is correctly implemented.
