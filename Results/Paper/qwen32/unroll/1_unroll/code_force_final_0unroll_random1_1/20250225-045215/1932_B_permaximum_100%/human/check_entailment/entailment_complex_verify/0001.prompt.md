You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t test cases. Each test case is a tuple (n, a), where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers representing the periodicities of the signs, with each integer a_i satisfying 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

    #The program returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the first common year when all signs change for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the first common year when all signs change for each test case, given the periodicities of the signs, and returns a list of these years.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.

### Solution Analysis:
The solution consists of a main program that reads input, processes each test case using the `func_1` function, and prints the results. Here's a breakdown of the `func_1` function:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `current_year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting point in time.

2. **Processing Each Sign**:
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign.
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. This is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - `current_year` is then updated to this next occurrence.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs, and this value is appended to the `results` list.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the first example provided:

- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing**:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- **Output**: `36`

The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs for the given example.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign and the requirement for sequential occurrences.
