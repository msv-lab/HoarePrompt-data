### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at specific intervals and must occur sequentially.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of these signs `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - For each periodicity:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be at `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next occurrence of the sign will be at the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - The `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence year.
   - After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` is added to the results list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results, which are the years in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the logic with the first example test case:
- **Input:** `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- **Processing:**
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).

The final `current_year` after processing all signs is `36`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
