### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every `a_i` years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The task is to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs.

#### Code Analysis:
The code reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case. For each test case, it calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs by iterating through each sign's periodicity and determining the next occurrence year.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the `func_1` function:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `current_year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting point in time.
2. **Processing Each Sign**:
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign.
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. This is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - `current_year` is then updated to this next occurrence.
3. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` is the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, and this value is appended to the `results` list.

#### Function Summary:
The function calculates the first common year when all signs change for each test case, given the periodicities of the signs, and returns a list of these years.

#### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
The function summary provided is not entirely accurate. The function does not calculate the "first common year when all signs change simultaneously." Instead, it calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs sequentially after each previous sign has occurred.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the first example provided:

- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing**:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- **Output**: `36`

The program correctly computes the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs for the given example.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign and the requirement for sequential occurrences. The function summary was misleading, but the implementation is correct.

**Correctness: True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
