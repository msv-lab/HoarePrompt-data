Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t test cases. Each test case is a tuple (n, a), where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers representing the periodicities of the signs, with each integer a_i satisfying 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.**
