Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the code and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`. This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Logic for Finding the Year of the N-th Sign**:
   - The program initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year (`next_year`) based on the current year and the periodicity of the sign.
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of the periodicity `ai`, the next occurrence is simply `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - It then updates `current_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.
   - This process ensures that the signs occur in sequence as required by the problem statement.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program outputs the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

The program handles all edge cases, such as:
- When all signs have a periodicity of 1, the n-th sign will occur in the n-th year.
- When the periodicities are different, the program correctly calculates the year based on the sequence of occurrences.

The provided examples in the problem statement also work correctly with this program, and no counterexamples can be found that would make the program incorrect. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
