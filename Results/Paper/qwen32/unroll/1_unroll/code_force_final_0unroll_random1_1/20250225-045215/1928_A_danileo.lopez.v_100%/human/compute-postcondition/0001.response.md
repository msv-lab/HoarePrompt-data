The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, so no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes.

Since the loop variable `_` does not need any specific state (it is just a placeholder), and the loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is at least 1, we do not need to adjust any state related to `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
