### Reasoning:

The task is to determine if a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, it checks if the resulting two smaller rectangles can form a different rectangle by ensuring that the resulting dimensions are not the same as the original dimensions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading two integers `a` and `b` for each test case.
2. **Even Check**: For each test case, it checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
   - If `a` is even, it checks if `a // 2` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `b` is even, it checks if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`.
3. **Output**: If either condition is satisfied, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis:

The logic is correct based on the problem description. If `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and potentially form a new rectangle unless the resulting dimensions are the same as the original dimensions. For example:
- If `a` is even, cutting it into two `a/2 x b` rectangles can form a `b x a` rectangle if `a/2` is not equal to `b`.
- Similarly, if `b` is even, cutting it into two `a x b/2` rectangles can form an `a x b` rectangle if `b/2` is not equal to `a`.

The program correctly implements this logic. It ensures that if the resulting dimensions after the cut are not the same as the original dimensions, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

**Correctness: True**
