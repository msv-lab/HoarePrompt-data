You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Input

    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6

    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the program will print either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `a` and `b` will be re-assigned for each iteration, but `t` will remain unchanged. The state of `t` and any other variables not involved in the loop body will remain the same as the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` can be split into two equal parts such that neither part is equal to the other integer, and 'No' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a logical flaw in handling the cases where either `a` or `b` is even. Specifically, it does not correctly evaluate all scenarios where a rectangle can be formed from the two resulting rectangles after a cut.

Let's analyze the code logic:

1. **Check if either `a` or `b` is even:**
   - If `a` is even, it divides `a` into two equal parts and checks if the new dimensions `(a//2, b)` are different from `(a, b)`.
   - If `b` is even, it divides `b` into two equal parts and checks if the new dimensions `(a, b//2)` are different from `(a, b)`.

2. **If both `a` and `b` are odd:**
   - It directly prints "No" because it assumes no other rectangle can be formed, which is incorrect.

However, the code does not handle cases where the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles of different sizes and then rearranged to form a new rectangle. For example, consider the case `a = 6` and `b = 3`:

- The rectangle can be cut into two `3x3` rectangles.
- These two `3x3` rectangles cannot form a new rectangle, but the code should handle this correctly.
- However, the code does not handle cases where the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of different sizes and then rearranged.

Another example is `a = 4` and `b = 3`:

- The rectangle can be cut into a `2x3` and a `2x3`.
- These can be rearranged to form a `3x4` rectangle, which is different from `4x3`.

The code should handle all such cases where the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle. The current code only checks for even dimensions and does not handle the general case where the dimensions can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Test Case to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
1
4 3
```
The expected output is:
```
Yes
```
But the code will output:
```
No
```
This is because the code does not handle the rearrangement of the two `2x3` rectangles to form a `3x4` rectangle.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
