Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). The function processes up to `t` test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided integers `n` and `m`.**
