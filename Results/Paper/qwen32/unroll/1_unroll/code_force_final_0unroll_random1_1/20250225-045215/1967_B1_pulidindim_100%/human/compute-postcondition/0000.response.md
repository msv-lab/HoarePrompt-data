The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state mentions that `t` is the number of test cases, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this line of code since they are not mentioned in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state will only reflect the value of `t` being set by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` and `m` are each positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6) for each test case.**
