Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value `ans` based on the provided integers `n` and `m`. The function handles up to `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input.**
