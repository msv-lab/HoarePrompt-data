The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, composed only of digits from 1 to 9. For each test case, it generates and prints two numbers: one formed by taking the maximum digit at each position from `x` and `y` until they differ, then the minimum digit thereafter, and the other formed by taking the minimum digit at each position from `x` and `y` until they differ, then the maximum digit thereafter.
