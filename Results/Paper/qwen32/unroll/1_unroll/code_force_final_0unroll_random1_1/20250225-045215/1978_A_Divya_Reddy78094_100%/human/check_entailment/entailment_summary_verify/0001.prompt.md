You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Output

    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of books and a list of `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the maximum number of pages from the first `n-1` books and the number of pages in the last book.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Alice has `n` books, each with a certain number of pages. She wants to divide these books into two non-empty piles and read the book with the maximum number of pages from each pile. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages she reads.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the number of pages for each book. The program then calculates the sum of the maximum number of pages in all books except the last one (`max(nums[:-1])`) and the number of pages in the last book (`nums[-1]`).

### Flaws in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Pages**: The program does not correctly determine the maximum pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. It simply takes the maximum of all books except the last one and adds the last book's pages. This does not guarantee the maximum sum of the highest pages from two non-empty piles.
   
2. **Non-Optimal Solution**: The program does not explore different ways to divide the books into two piles to find the optimal solution. It only considers a specific division that is not necessarily the best one.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Sort the books by the number of pages in descending order.
- Consider different ways to split the sorted list into two non-empty piles.
- Calculate the sum of the maximum pages from each pile for each possible split.
- Choose the split that gives the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not explore all possible ways to divide the books into two piles and does not guarantee the maximum pages Alice can read.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
