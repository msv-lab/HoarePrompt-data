Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program always takes the last book and the maximum of all books except the last one, which is not the optimal strategy for maximizing the total number of pages Alice can read.

To solve the problem correctly, Alice should divide the books into two piles such that the sum of the highest number of pages in each pile is maximized. The optimal strategy is to find the two largest numbers in the list and sum them, as these represent the highest number of pages Alice can read from each pile.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        print(nums[-1] + nums[-2])

func()
```

This program sorts the list of books by the number of pages and then sums the two largest numbers, which is the correct approach to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read.
