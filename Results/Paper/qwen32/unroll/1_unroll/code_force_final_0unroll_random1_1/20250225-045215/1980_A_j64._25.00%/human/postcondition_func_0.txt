The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (number of problems), an integer `m` (number of upcoming rounds), and a string `a` (problem difficulties). The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of additional problems needed for the corresponding test case.
