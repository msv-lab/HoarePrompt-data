The provided code snippet is a function definition but does not include the actual implementation of the function. Therefore, the code does not modify any variables or perform any operations that would change the initial state. The function is intended to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create based on the given test cases, but it does not execute any logic to do so in the provided snippet.

Given the initial state and the fact that no operations are performed, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
