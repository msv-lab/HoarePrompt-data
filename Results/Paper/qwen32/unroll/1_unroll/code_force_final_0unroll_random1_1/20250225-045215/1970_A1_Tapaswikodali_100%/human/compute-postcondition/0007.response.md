To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. `n` is the length of `s`.
3. `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `position` in descending order for objects with the same `balance`.
4. `balance` is initialized to 0.
5. `result` is a string formed by joining the `character` attributes of `balance_info` objects in the specified order.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String `s`:** Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, for every opening parenthesis "(", there is a corresponding closing parenthesis ")".
2. **List `balance_info`:** This list contains `BalanceInfo` objects. Each `BalanceInfo` object has at least two attributes: `character` (which is either "(" or ")") and `balance` (which represents the net balance of parentheses up to that point in the sequence).
3. **Sorting of `balance_info`:** The list is sorted primarily by `balance` in ascending order. For entries with the same `balance`, the sorting is done by `position` in descending order.
4. **Result Construction:** The `result` string is formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of the `BalanceInfo` objects in the sorted order of `balance_info`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `balance_info` is sorted by `balance` in ascending order, the `BalanceInfo` objects with the lowest `balance` values will appear first in the list.
- For a balanced parentheses sequence, the `balance` will start at 0, increase by 1 for each "(", and decrease by 1 for each ")".
- The sorting by `position` in descending order for objects with the same `balance` means that for the same balance value, the later characters in the original string `s` will appear first in the `balance_info` list.

### Example:
Let's consider a simple example where `s = "(()())"`:
- The `balance_info` list might look something like this:
  - `BalanceInfo(character='(', balance=1, position=0)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character='(', balance=2, position=1)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character=')', balance=1, position=2)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character='(', balance=2, position=3)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character=')', balance=1, position=4)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character=')', balance=0, position=5)`
- After sorting by `balance` (ascending) and `position` (descending) for the same balance, the list would be rearranged:
  - `BalanceInfo(character=')', balance=0, position=5)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character=')', balance=1, position=4)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character=')', balance=1, position=2)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character='(', balance=1, position=0)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character='(', balance=2, position=3)`
  - `BalanceInfo(character='(', balance=2, position=1)`
- The `result` string formed by joining the `character` attributes in this order would be `"))(()("`.

### General Case:
For any balanced parentheses sequence `s`, the `result` string will be a rearrangement of the characters in `s` based on the specified sorting criteria.

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will output the `result` string, which is a rearrangement of the characters in `s` based on the sorting of `balance_info`.

Output: **result (where result is the string formed by joining the `character` attributes of `balance_info` objects in the specified order)**
