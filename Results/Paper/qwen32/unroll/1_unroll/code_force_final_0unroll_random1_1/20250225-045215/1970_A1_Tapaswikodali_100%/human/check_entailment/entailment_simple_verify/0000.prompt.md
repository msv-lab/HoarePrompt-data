You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:

- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix of a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of a character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix of a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of a character in the input sequence. Additionally, the balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns 0.

            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and the string represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance at each index `i` of `s` and the character at that index; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string formed by joining the `character` attributes of `balance_info` objects in the specified order)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it accurately performs the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code step-by-step and verify if it meets all the requirements.

### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(infoA, infoB)`**:
   - This function is intended to be used as a custom comparator for sorting.
   - It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance values first, and if they are equal, it compares their positions in decreasing order.

2. **Function `func_2(s)`**:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information of prefixes and a variable `balance` to keep track of the balance of the current prefix.
   - **Building Balance Information**: It iterates over the string `s`, appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` for each character, updating the balance accordingly.
   - **Sorting**: It sorts the `balance_info` list using the custom comparator `func_1`.
   - **Generating Result**: It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.

### Key Points to Verify

- **Correctness of the Comparator**: The comparator should correctly sort the `BalanceInfo` objects based on the balance and position as specified.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The code should handle edge cases such as the shortest balanced sequence and sequences with the maximum possible length (500,000).

### Verification

1. **Comparator Function `func_1`**:
   - The comparator correctly sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal. This ensures that the balanced shuffle operation is performed correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The balance calculation and storage are correct.
   - The sorting step uses the comparator correctly.
   - The result string is generated by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Testing

Let's test the code with the provided example and a few additional edge cases.

#### Example Test Case
```python
s = "(()(()))"
# Expected Output: "()(()())"
```

#### Additional Test Cases
1. **Shortest Balanced Sequence**:
   - Input: `"()"`
   - Expected Output: `"()"`
   
2. **Longest Balanced Sequence**:
   - Input: `"(" * 250000 + ")" * 250000`
   - Expected Output: `"(" * 250000 + ")" * 250000`

3. **Complex Balanced Sequence**:
   - Input: `"((()))"`
   - Expected Output: `"((()))"`

### Conclusion

After analyzing and testing the code, it appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The comparator function correctly sorts the balance information, and the result string is generated accurately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the balance information for each prefix, sorts it using the specified comparator, and constructs the balanced shuffle of the input sequence. The code handles various test cases, including edge cases, correctly.
