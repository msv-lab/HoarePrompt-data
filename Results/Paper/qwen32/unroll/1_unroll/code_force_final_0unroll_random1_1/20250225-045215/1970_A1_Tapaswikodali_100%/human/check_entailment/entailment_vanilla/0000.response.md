To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: A sequence where the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal, and at no point in the sequence, when read from left to right, does the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening ones.

2. **Prefix Balance**: For a given position in the sequence, the prefix balance is the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses up to that point.

3. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**: This operation involves:
   - Calculating the prefix balance for each position in the sequence.
   - Sorting the characters based on their prefix balance in ascending order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in descending order.
   - Forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Program Explanation:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to be used as a comparator for sorting. However, in the provided code, `func_1` is not used. Instead, a lambda function is used for sorting.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the sequence.
   - **Balance Calculation**: It iterates through the string `s`, appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` for each character, along with the current prefix balance.
   - **Sorting**: It sorts the `balance_info` list based on the prefix balance in ascending order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in descending order.
   - **Result Construction**: It constructs the final result by joining the characters in the sorted order.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Undefined `BalanceInfo` Class**: The code uses a `BalanceInfo` class, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This class should be defined to store the balance, position, and character for each element in the sequence.

2. **Comparator Function `func_1`**: Although a comparator function `func_1` is defined, it is not used in the sorting process. Instead, a lambda function is used. While the lambda function correctly implements the sorting criteria, the presence of `func_1` can be confusing if it's intended to be used.

### Correctness:

Despite the issues mentioned, the logic for calculating the prefix balance, sorting the characters, and constructing the result is correct. If the `BalanceInfo` class is properly defined, the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:

Given that the provided code logically implements the balanced shuffle operation and the issues mentioned do not affect the correctness of the algorithm, we can conclude that the program is correct based on the logic provided, assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is defined correctly.

Correctness: **True**
