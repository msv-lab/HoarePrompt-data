i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks, respectively. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited. coef is a list of integers used to assign coefficients for bipartite checking. tot is an integer used to accumulate the total of the coefficients. bipartite is a boolean variable used to check if the graph formed by the disks is bipartite.
