The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The current state of other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, `ok`) does not affect whether the loop executes or not, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 (which it will be automatically in the first iteration of the loop).

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `y` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `r` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `visited` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`**
