The code snippet provided is `visited = [False] * n`. This line reassigns the `visited` list to a new list of size `n` with all elements set to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `y` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `r` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `visited` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of size `n` initialized to `None`.**
