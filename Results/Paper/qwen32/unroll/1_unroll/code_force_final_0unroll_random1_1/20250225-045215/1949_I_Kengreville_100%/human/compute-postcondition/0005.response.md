The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` reassigns `coef` to a new list of size `n` with all elements set to `None`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, as these variables are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `y` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `r` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `visited` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`.**
