### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The program uses two main lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative distances the pinball travels based on the direction characters ('<' and '>').

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the execution process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the directions.

2. **Processing '>' Directions**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` to calculate the cumulative distance for each '>' character.
   - It uses the `A` list to store these cumulative distances and `idx_A` to store the indices of '>' characters.
   - The cumulative distance `x` is calculated based on the previous cumulative distance and the number of '>' characters encountered so far.

3. **Processing '<' Directions**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` in reverse to calculate the cumulative distance for each '<' character.
   - It uses the `B` list to store these cumulative distances and `idx_B` to store the indices of '<' characters.
   - The cumulative distance `x` is calculated based on the previous cumulative distance and the number of '<' characters encountered so far.

4. **Calculating Final Positions**:
   - The program iterates through each position in the string `s` to calculate the final position of the pinball.
   - Depending on whether the character at the current position is '>' or '<', it uses the cumulative distances stored in `A` and `B` to calculate the final position.
   - The final position is printed for each starting position.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the logic for both '>' and '<' directions.
- It uses cumulative distances to efficiently calculate the final position of the pinball for each starting position.
- The logic for handling the boundary conditions (pinball leaving the grid) seems to be correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Given the provided execution summary and the problem constraints, the program seems to be functioning as expected.

**Correctness: True**
