To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In the provided `for` loop statement:

```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(0, n)` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `B` is `[0, 1]`
- `idx_B` is `[1, 0]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `2`

The variables `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only variable that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`B` is [0, 1], `idx_B` is [1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
