The code snippet provided initializes a new list `idx_B` as an empty list. The initial state includes several variables: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is [0, 2, 6], `idx_A` is [0, 2, 4], and `B` is an empty list. The only change made by the code is the creation of `idx_B` as an empty list. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is [0, 2, 6], `idx_A` is [0, 2, 4], `B` is [], `idx_B` is [].**
