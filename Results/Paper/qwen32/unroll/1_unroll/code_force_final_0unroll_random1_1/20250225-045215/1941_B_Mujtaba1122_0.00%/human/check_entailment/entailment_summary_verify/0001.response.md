### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical logical error in the implementation of the operation within the `func_2` function. Let's break down the detailed analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is correctly implemented. It checks if all elements of the list are zero and returns `True` if they are, otherwise it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The primary task of `func_2` is to attempt to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation requires choosing an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) and performing the following:
     - Decrease `a[i-1]` by 1.
     - Decrease `a[i]` by 2.
     - Decrease `a[i+1]` by 1.
   - The current implementation of the operation within `func_2` is incorrect. Instead of performing the above steps, the code incorrectly subtracts `a[i-1]` times 1 from `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` times 2 from `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` times 1 from `a[i+1]`. This results in an incorrect transformation of the array elements.

3. **Logical Error**:
   - The logical error in the implementation of `func_2` means that the function does not correctly apply the operation as described in the problem statement. This incorrect application can lead to incorrect results, making the program unable to determine whether it is possible to reduce all elements of the array to zero.

### Conclusion:
Given the logical error in `func_2`, the program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment correctly identifies this error and concludes that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
