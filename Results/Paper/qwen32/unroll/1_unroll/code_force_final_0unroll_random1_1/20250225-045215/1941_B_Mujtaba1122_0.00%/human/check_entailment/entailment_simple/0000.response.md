Reasoning: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iteratively applying the described operation to the array elements. However, there are some issues with the implementation that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Decrement Logic**: In the `func_2` function, the decrement logic inside the while loop is incorrect. The current implementation subtracts `list[i - 1]` times the respective values from `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]`. Instead, it should decrement `1` from `list[i - 1]`, `2` from `list[i]`, and `1` from `list[i + 1]`.

2. **Condition Check for While Loop**: The condition inside the while loop should ensure that `list[i] >= 2` (since we need to subtract `2` from `list[i]`), not `list[i] > 1`.

3. **Final Check with `func_1`**: The `func_1` function is intended to check if the first `n` elements of the list are zero. However, the `func_2` function does not guarantee that the entire list will be zero after the operations, only the first `n` elements. This might not be a problem in this context because the input constraints ensure that `n` is the length of the list, but it is still an important consideration.

Given these issues, the program as written does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

Correctness: **False**
