Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `lst` of `n` integers.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros. If any element is not zero, it returns `False`. If all are zeros, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to modify the list such that the first `n` elements become zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates over the list from the second element to the second last element (`i` from 1 to `n-2`).
   - For each element `i`, it repeatedly applies the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - However, the operation inside the while loop is incorrect. Instead of decrementing `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, it incorrectly multiplies these values by `list[i-1]` before subtracting.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if the first `n` elements of the list are zeros and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

The critical issue is in the logic of the operation inside `func_2`. The operation should be:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```
But the provided code incorrectly does:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```
This will cause incorrect behavior and the function will not be able to properly reduce the elements to zero as intended.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to the flawed operation inside `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
