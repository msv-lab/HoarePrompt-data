### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code and compare it with the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
- An operation can be performed at index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`):
  - `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
  - `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
  - `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation any number of times.

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to apply the operations to the list and then check if all elements can be made zero.
   - The core issue lies in the implementation of the operations:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     This code incorrectly modifies the elements. It should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
   - The current implementation incorrectly subtracts multiples of `list[i - 1]` from the elements, which is not aligned with the problem's operation rules.
   - Due to this incorrect operation, the function cannot correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary suggests that `func_2` modifies the first `n-2` elements of the list under certain conditions and then checks if the modified list satisfies a specific condition using `func_1`.
- However, the summary does not account for the incorrect operation implementation in `func_2`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the code:
  - The incorrect implementation of the operation.
  - The logic does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero.
- The example provided in the assessment correctly demonstrates that the current implementation fails to produce the correct result.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
