In the given program state, the `while` loop condition is `while queue:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. The `queue` is initially a `deque` containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Since `queue` is not empty (it contains one element), the loop can proceed without any modification to the state.

Therefore, the state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list stored in the variable tree, which is a dictionary where keys are node integers and values are lists of neighboring node integers, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.**
