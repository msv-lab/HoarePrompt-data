Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v (1 <= u, v <= n), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed (1 <= start <= n), and `tree` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes. `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node in the tree. `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`. `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers.**
