Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the structure of a tree and the distances from a starting node to two leaf nodes. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of edges represented as tuples), and `start` (the starting node). The function returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances from the starting node to any two leaf nodes is odd, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.**
