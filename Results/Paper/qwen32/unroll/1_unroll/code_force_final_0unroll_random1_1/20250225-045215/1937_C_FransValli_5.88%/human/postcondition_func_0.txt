The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of integers. It interactively queries the system to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The function's purpose is to identify and output a pair of indices for each test case such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized.
