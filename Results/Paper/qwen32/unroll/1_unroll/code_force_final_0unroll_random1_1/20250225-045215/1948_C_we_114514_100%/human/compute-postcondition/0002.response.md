The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified, and the initial conditions of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length n consisting of the characters '<' and/or '>', `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list.**
