### Reasoning

The original assessment accurately identifies a significant flaw in the logic of `func_1`. The program's approach focuses on specific conditions where the robot could get trapped, but it does not account for all possible paths that the robot could take to reach the target cell (2, n). Let's break down the issues further:

1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if there is a left arrow (`<`) at an odd index in `row1` and a left arrow (`<`) at either the corresponding even index or the next even index in `row2`. If this condition is met, it returns 'No'.
   - It also checks if the last cell in `row1` has a left arrow (`<`) and the second last cell in `row2` has a left arrow (`<`). If this condition is met, it returns 'No'.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Counter-example**:
   - The provided counter-example grid is:
     ```
     >>><
     ><>>
     ```
   - For `n = 4`, the program will incorrectly return 'No' because it will encounter the condition `row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')` when `i = 0` (i.e., checking `row1[1]` and `row2[0]` or `row2[2]`), but this does not mean the robot is trapped. The robot can move as follows:
     - (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)

3. **Generalization**:
   - The logic does not consider scenarios where the robot can zigzag between the rows using right arrows (`>`) to eventually reach the target cell (2, n). The function's logic is too restrictive and does not account for all possible paths the robot could take.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach (2, n) for all possible grid configurations. The logic in `func_1` is incomplete and can lead to incorrect results for certain grid configurations.

**Final: False**
