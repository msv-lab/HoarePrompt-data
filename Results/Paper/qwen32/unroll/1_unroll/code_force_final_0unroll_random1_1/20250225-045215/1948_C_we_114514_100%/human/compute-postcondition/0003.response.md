In the given for loop, the only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the integer `t`. The loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`. The variables `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `results` do not affect whether the loop will execute or not; they are used within the loop body.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The current state specifies that `t` is an input integer, but it does not specify its value. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length n consisting of the characters '<' and/or '>', `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**.
