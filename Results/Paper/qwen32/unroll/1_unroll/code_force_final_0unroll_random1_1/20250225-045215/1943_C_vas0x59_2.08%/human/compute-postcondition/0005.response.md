To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1(d)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only make assumptions based on the typical operations that might be performed on a list of distances in a graph context.

Given that `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the graph, a common operation might involve processing or transforming these distances in some way. However, without the exact definition of `func_1`, we can only assume that `func_1(d)` returns a new list `a` based on the distances in `d`.

For the sake of this task, let's assume that `func_1(d)` performs a simple operation, such as doubling each distance in the list `d`. This is just an assumption to illustrate the process. If `func_1` performs a different operation, the output state would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Let's assume:
```
def func_1(d):
    return [2 * dist for dist in d]
```

Given this assumption, the new list `a` would contain each distance in `d` multiplied by 2.

Output State: **a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices directly connected to the corresponding vertex, representing an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the graph; `a` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the graph, where each distance is twice the value in `d`.**

In simpler terms:
Output State: **The graph represented by the list of lists remains unchanged; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `a` is a list of distances where each distance is twice the corresponding distance in `d`.**
