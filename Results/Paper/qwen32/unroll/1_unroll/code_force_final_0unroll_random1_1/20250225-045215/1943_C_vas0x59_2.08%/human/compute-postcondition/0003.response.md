To determine the output state, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop runs `n - 1` times, and in each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `u` and `v` from the input, decrements both by 1, and then appends `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs` and `u` to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`. 

This process effectively builds an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. Each vertex is represented by an index in the `u2vs` list, and the list at each index contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to it.

Given that the loop runs `n - 1` times, it will process `n - 1` edges. After the loop completes, `u2vs` will contain the adjacency list of the graph.

Since the exact input values of `u` and `v` are not provided, we can only describe the general structure of the output state. The output state will be a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex.

Output State: **a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices directly connected to the corresponding vertex, representing an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges.**
