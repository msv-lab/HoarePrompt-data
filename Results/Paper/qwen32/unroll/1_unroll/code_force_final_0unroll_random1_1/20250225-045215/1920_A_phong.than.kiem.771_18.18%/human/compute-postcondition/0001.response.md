The code assigns the value of `string.find(substring)` to the variable `index`. The `find` method returns the lowest index in the string where the substring is found, or -1 if the substring is not found. The values of `string` and `substring` remain unchanged, and `indices` is still an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `indices` is an empty list, and `index` is the result of `string.find(substring)`.

Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `indices` is an empty list, `index` is the result of `string.find(substring)`**
