Output State: **`lst` and `rev` are defaultdicts where `lst[a]` contains all `b` such that a pair (a, b) was read, and `rev[b]` contains all `a` such that a pair (a, b) was read. `z` is an input integer.**
In natural language: The `lst` and `rev` defaultdicts remain unchanged. A new variable `z` is assigned the value of an input integer.
