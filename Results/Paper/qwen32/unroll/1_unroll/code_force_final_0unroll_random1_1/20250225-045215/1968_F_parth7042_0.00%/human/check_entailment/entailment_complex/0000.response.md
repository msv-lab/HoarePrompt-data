### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether subarrays of a given array are "interesting" based on the criteria that the array can be split into parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program reads multiple test cases, each containing an array and a set of queries. For each query, it checks if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings for easier processing.
   - It then iterates through each test case, extracting the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the i-th element.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that value occurs.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the entire subarray has an XOR of 0, and the subarray can trivially be split into parts with equal XOR (each part being the entire subarray).
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there exist indices in the prefix XOR array such that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR:
     - It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.
     - If such indices are found, it appends "YES" to the results; otherwise, it appends "NO".

4. **Output:**
   - The results for all queries across all test cases are printed, with each test case's results separated by a newline.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly computed, and it allows efficient calculation of the XOR of any subarray.
  
- **Correctness of Query Processing:**
  - The program correctly checks if the XOR of the subarray is 0, which indicates that the subarray can be trivially split.
  - For non-zero XOR values, the program correctly uses the prefix XOR array and the dictionary `mp` to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
  - The use of binary search ensures that the program efficiently finds the required indices.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as subarrays with a single element correctly (though such cases are not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, they are implicitly handled by the logic).
  - The program also handles cases where the subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if subarrays are interesting based on the given criteria. The use of prefix XOR and a dictionary for quick lookups ensures efficiency, which is crucial given the constraints.

**Correctness:** **True**
