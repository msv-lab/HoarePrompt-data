Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `a` contains `n` integers, and each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes each query and returns the sum of the elements in the subarray `a[l-1:r]` for each query.**
