The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. This affects the variable `t` but does not impact any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
