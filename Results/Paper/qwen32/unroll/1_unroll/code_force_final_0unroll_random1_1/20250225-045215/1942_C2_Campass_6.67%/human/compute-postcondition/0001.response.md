The code snippet `t, = R()` reads a single integer from the input, which is assigned to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen remain unchanged as they are not mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer.**
