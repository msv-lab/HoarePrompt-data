Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a list `res` where each element `res_i` is calculated as `mex - ar_i`, with `mex` starting at `n` and updating based on the values in `a`.**
