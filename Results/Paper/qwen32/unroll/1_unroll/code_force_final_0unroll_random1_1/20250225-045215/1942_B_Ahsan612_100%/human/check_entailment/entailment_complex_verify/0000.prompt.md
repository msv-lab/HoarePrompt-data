You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a list `res` of n integers is printed where each integer `res_i` is calculated as `mex - ar_i` with `mex` starting at `n` and decreasing as the loop progresses.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a list `res` where each element `res_i` is calculated as `mex - ar_i`, with `mex` starting at `n` and updating based on the values in `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a` according to the problem description. Here is a detailed analysis of the issues:

The program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. For each element `ar[i]` in `a`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates the `mex` if necessary. However, this approach does not guarantee that the constructed `p` will be a valid permutation, and it does not correctly maintain the `mex` value.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:
Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the provided code will produce:
```
5 4 7 3 1
```

Explanation of the incorrect output:
1. The program starts with `mex = 5`.
2. For `i = 4`, `ar[4] = 2`, so `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3` and `mex` becomes `3`.
3. For `i = 3`, `ar[3] = 1`, so `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2` and `mex` becomes `2`.
4. For `i = 2`, `ar[2] = -2`, so `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4` and `mex` becomes `4`.
5. For `i = 1`, `ar[1] = 1`, so `res[1] = 4 - 1 = 3` and `mex` becomes `3`.
6. For `i = 0`, `ar[0] = 1`, so `res[0] = 3 - 1 = 2` and `mex` becomes `2`.

The resulting `res` is `[2, 3, 4, 2, 3]`, which is not a valid permutation and does not match the expected output.

The correct approach would involve maintaining a set of available numbers (initially all numbers from `0` to `n-1`) and updating this set as we construct the permutation `p`. For each `a_i`, we calculate `p_i` as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_{i-1}) - a_i` and remove `p_i` from the set of available numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        available = set(range(n))
        for i in range(n):
            mex = min(available)
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            available.remove(res[i])
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that `res` is a valid permutation and meets the requirements of the problem description.
