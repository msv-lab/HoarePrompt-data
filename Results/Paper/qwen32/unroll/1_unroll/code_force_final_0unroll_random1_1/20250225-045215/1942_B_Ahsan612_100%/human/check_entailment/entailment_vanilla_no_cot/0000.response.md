Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The issue lies in the way the MEX value is being updated and used to construct `p`.

Let's analyze the program's logic:
- The program initializes `mex` to `n` (which is the maximum possible value of MEX for an array of length `n`).
- It then iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first.
- For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
- It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

However, this approach does not correctly maintain the MEX value as the construction progresses. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`, and this needs to be dynamically updated as elements are added to `p`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly calculates the MEX value and constructs the permutation `p`:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = 0
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- `mex` is initialized to `0` (the smallest possible MEX value).
- A set `used` is maintained to keep track of the numbers that have been used in `p`.
- For each element `ar[i]`, `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, and this value is added to the `used` set.
- `mex` is then incremented until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.

This ensures that the MEX value is correctly maintained and updated as the permutation `p` is constructed.
