n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where 'F' indicates a funny transition video, 'S' indicates a scary transition video, '?' indicates an undecided transition video, and '.' indicates that i equals j. The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. There are at most floor(n/2) characters that are either 'F' or 'S'.
