Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of a symmetric matrix (2 <= n <= 24), and a matrix of size n x n where each element is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The function returns a result based on the distribution of 'F' and 'S' characters in the matrix, ensuring there are at most floor(n/2) of these characters.**
