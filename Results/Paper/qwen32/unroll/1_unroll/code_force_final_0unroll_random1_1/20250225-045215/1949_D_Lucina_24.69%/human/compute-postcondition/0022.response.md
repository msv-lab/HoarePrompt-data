Functionality: **The function reads a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where each element is 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and replaces '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each row. It prints the modified matrix, ensuring that '?' characters are replaced according to specific rules involving nodes with only 'F' or only 'S'.**
