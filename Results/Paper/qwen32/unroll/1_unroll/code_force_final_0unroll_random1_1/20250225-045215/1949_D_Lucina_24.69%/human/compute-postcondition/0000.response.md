Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where 'F' denotes a funny transition video, 'S' denotes a scary transition video, '?' denotes an undecided transition video, and '.' denotes the same scenario (i.e., i=j). The input is symmetric, meaning the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line. There are at most floor(n/2) characters in the input that are either 'F' or 'S'.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. All other conditions and constraints regarding the input matrix remain unchanged as the code snippet only reads the value of `n`.
