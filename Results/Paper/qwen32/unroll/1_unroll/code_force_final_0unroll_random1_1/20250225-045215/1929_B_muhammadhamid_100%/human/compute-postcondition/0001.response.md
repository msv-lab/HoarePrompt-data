Output State: **The function will output the number of colored cells needed for each test case based on the given conditions. For each test case, if k is 1, it outputs 1. If k is less than or equal to 2 * (n + (n - 2)), it outputs the ceiling of k divided by 2. Otherwise, it outputs k divided by 2 plus 1. The state of variables not involved in the loop remains unchanged.**
