Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers, `n` and `k`. Here, `n` represents the size of a square grid, and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. For each test case, the function calculates and outputs the minimum number of colored cells required to meet the condition on `k`.**
