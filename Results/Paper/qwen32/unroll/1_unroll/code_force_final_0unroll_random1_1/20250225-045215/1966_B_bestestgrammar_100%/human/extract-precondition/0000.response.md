Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. Following these integers, there are n lines, each containing a string of m characters ('W' or 'B') representing the initial colors of the squares in the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
