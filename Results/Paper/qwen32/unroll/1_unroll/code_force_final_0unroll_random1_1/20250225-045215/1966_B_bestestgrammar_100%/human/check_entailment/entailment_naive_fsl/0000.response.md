Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. The program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same and then checks if all the squares in the first row and the first column are the same. If these conditions are not met, it concludes that it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. However, this is an incorrect assumption.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
3 3
WBB
BWB
BBW
```

For this input, the program will output "NO" because the top-left corner ('W') is not the same as the bottom-right corner ('W'), and the first row and column do not have all the same color. However, it is actually possible to make the entire grid the same color using the allowed operations. Here's how:

1. Select positions (1, 2) and (3, 2) (both 'B') and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to 'B'. The grid becomes:
   ```
   WBB
   BBB
   BBB
   ```
2. Select positions (1, 1) and (1, 3) (both 'B') and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to 'B'. The grid becomes:
   ```
   BBB
   BBB
   BBB
   ```

Thus, the correct output for this input should be "YES", but the program outputs "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
