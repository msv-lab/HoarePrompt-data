### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by checking if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Initial Check on Top-Left and Bottom-Right Cells:**
   - The program first checks if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are of the same color. If they are not, it proceeds to check if the entire grid can be made uniform by verifying the consistency of colors in the first and last rows and columns.
   
2. **Checking Consistency in Rows and Columns:**
   - If the top-left and bottom-right cells are of different colors, the program then checks whether each row and each column is uniform (all cells in a row or column are of the same color). This is done by iterating through each row and column and checking if adjacent cells have the same color.
   - If any row or column is not uniform, it sets `impossible` to `False`, indicating that it's not possible to make the entire grid uniform by the given operations.
   
3. **Final Decision:**
   - If `impossible` remains `True` after checking the rows and columns, the program concludes that it's not possible to make the entire grid uniform and outputs 'NO'.
   - If `impossible` is `False`, or if the top-left and bottom-right cells were initially the same color, the program outputs 'YES'.

### Correctness:

The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that if the first and last rows and columns are uniform, the entire grid can be made uniform. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows and columns are uniform, but there is a different color in the middle that cannot be changed to match the rest using the given operations.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the flaw:
```
3 3
WBB
BWB
BBW
```
In this grid, the first and last rows and columns are uniform, but the entire grid cannot be made uniform using the given operations. The program would incorrectly output 'YES' for this case.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
