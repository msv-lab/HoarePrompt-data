Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing the allowed operations. The logic in the program is flawed and does not cover all cases. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks only the corners of the grid and the adjacent cells in the first row and column. It does not check the entire grid for the possibility of making all cells the same color.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program incorrectly assumes that if the corners are different, and the adjacent cells in the first row and column are the same, then it is not possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is not necessarily true. There could be a way to make the entire grid the same color even if the corners are different.

3. **Simpler Solution**: A simpler and correct approach is to check if all cells in the grid are the same or if all cells can be made the same by checking if all cells are either 'W' or 'B'. If there is at least one 'W' and at least one 'B', then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        has_w = False
        has_b = False
        for i in range(n):
            row = input()
            gr.append(row)
            if 'W' in row:
                has_w = True
            if 'B' in row:
                has_b = True
            if has_w and has_b:
                break
        if has_w and has_b:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected program checks if there is at least one 'W' and at least one 'B' in the grid. If both are present, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. Otherwise, it prints "YES".
