To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step according to the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. The key observation is that if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have different colors, then there must be a way to separate the grid into two distinct regions of different colors that cannot be unified using the described operations.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (n, m) and the grid itself.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have the same color, the program immediately concludes that it is possible to make the entire grid the same color and sets `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Detailed Check:**
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, the program performs a more detailed check.
   - It checks if all the cells in the first row are the same color and if all the cells in the last row are the same color.
   - It also checks if all the cells in the first column are the same color and if all the cells in the last column are the same color.
   - If both the first and last rows or both the first and last columns are uniform in color, the program concludes that it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color and sets `ans` to 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis:
The logic in the program is based on the observation that if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, then there must be a separation along either the rows or columns that cannot be unified using the allowed operations. However, this is not a comprehensive check. There could be scenarios where the grid can still be unified even if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, provided there are no "crossings" of different colors that cannot be resolved.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
W B
B W
```
Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors ('W' and 'W' respectively), but the grid can be made uniform by selecting (1,1) and (2,2) and then (1,2) and (2,1). This scenario is not handled by the program, leading to an incorrect 'NO' response.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios, and there are cases where it will incorrectly output 'NO' when it should output 'YES'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
