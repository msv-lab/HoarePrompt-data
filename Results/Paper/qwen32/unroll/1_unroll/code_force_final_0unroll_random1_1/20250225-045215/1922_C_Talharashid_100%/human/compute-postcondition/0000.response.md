The loop head in the given code snippet is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute based on the integer value provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is the input that will be provided to the loop, which corresponds to the variable `t` in the problem description.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input to the loop is within this range to make sure the loop executes the correct number of times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
