You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. An array `a` of length `m` is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of length `m` such that:
   - The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
   - Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
   - Each element in `b` is greater than 0.
2. For each query, determine if a subarray of `c` is "good".

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine if a subarray is "good" by calculating the sum and the count of 1s in the subarray and then checking a condition.

#### Key Points in the Program:
- The program calculates the prefix sums (`p`) and the prefix counts of 1s (`c`) for the array `l`.
- For each query, it calculates the sum (`s`) and the count of 1s (`i`) in the subarray.
- It then checks the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i` to determine if the subarray is "good".

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Single Element Subarrays**:
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element. If the subarray has only one element, the program will always print "NO" because the condition is not met.
   - However, a single-element subarray can still be "good" if the element is greater than 1 (since we can create `b` with a different value, e.g., `a_i = 2` and `b_i = 1`).

2. **General Case Handling**:
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` seems to be checking if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of 1s. This condition ensures that the sum can be redistributed to form `b` while satisfying the constraints.
   - However, this condition might not cover all cases where a subarray can be "good". For example, if the subarray has multiple elements and the sum is large enough, it should be possible to create `b` with different values while keeping the sum the same.

### Test Case to Demonstrate Issue:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
1 1
2
1 1
```
- The subarray is `[2]`.
- According to the program, it will print "NO" because `b - a + 1 > 1` is not satisfied.
- However, this subarray is "good" because we can create `b` as `[1]` (which is different from `a` and has a sum of 1, which is less than the sum of `a` but can be adjusted to match by increasing other elements in `b`).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has only one element and that element is greater than 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
