To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration.

The loop processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \).
2. It converts each of these integers to the nearest smaller even number using the lambda function `lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2`. This means it effectively floors the number to the nearest even integer.
3. It then checks if the first three numbers (after flooring) have an odd count of odd numbers. This is done with `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`.
4. It calculates the sum of the floored numbers and divides it by 2.
5. It prints the result of the logical condition (which is either 0 or 1) plus the sum of the floored numbers divided by 2.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the output for each test case is printed immediately, the overall "state" after all iterations is simply the sequence of outputs for each test case.

Given that the problem asks for the output state in a format similar to the initial state, and since the output is not stored but printed, we can describe the output state as a sequence of the printed values for each test case.

However, since the problem asks for a single output state in the format provided, and since the output is a sequence of values rather than a single set of values, we need to understand that the output state is a series of outputs for each test case.

For the sake of providing a concrete answer in the requested format, let's assume we have a single test case for demonstration. If the input is `1 2 3 4`, the floored values would be `0 2 2 4`, the sum of the first three numbers modulo 2 would be `0`, and the sum of the floored numbers divided by 2 would be `4`. The output for this test case would be `0 + 4 = 4`.

If we had multiple test cases, the output state would be a sequence of such results.

Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases and asks for a single output state, we can assume a single test case for simplicity.

Given a single test case `1 2 3 4`:
- Floored values: `0 2 2 4`
- Sum of first three modulo 2: `0`
- Sum of floored numbers divided by 2: `4`
- Output: `0 + 4 = 4`

Output State: **4**

If there are multiple test cases, the output state would be a sequence of such results. For the sake of a single output state in the requested format, we assume a single test case.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Since the problem does not specify multiple test cases and asks for a single output state, we will assume a single test case for demonstration purposes. If there are multiple test cases, the output state would be a sequence of such results.

Given the problem constraints and the need for a single output state, we will assume a single test case for simplicity.
