To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, we need to understand the values of `s` and `m`. Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `n` is an integer value provided as input.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the return values from the function `func_2(a)`. Specifically, `s` is the first return value, and `m` is the second return value.

Since the function `func_2(a)` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `m`. However, we can describe them in terms of what they represent based on the function's return values.

Thus, the print statement `print(s, m)` will output the values of `s` and `m` as returned by `func_2(a)`.

Output: **s, m (where s and m are the first and second return values of func_2(a), respectively)**
