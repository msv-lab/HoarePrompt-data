You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies the array `a` by setting elements within a specified subarray range `[l, r]` to a specific value based on a condition. If the sum of the elements in the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, all elements in that subarray are set to the length of the subarray. Otherwise, the function recursively processes subarrays divided by the maximum element's position within the current range.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, processes the list using `func_2`, and prints the sum `s` and maximum `m` of the list, followed by a series of operations `ops`. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged after the function concludes.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. 

1. **Function `func_2` does not pass `a` and `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly:**
   ```python
   def func_2(a):
       n = len(a)
       ops = []

       recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)  # 'a' and 'ops' are not passed here
       return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)
   ```
   The `recursive_maximize_sum` function should receive `a` and `ops` as parameters, but they are not being passed. This will result in a `NameError` as `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined correctly:**
   ```python
   def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
       s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
       if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
           func_1(a, l, r, ops)
           ops.append((l, r))
           for i in range(l, r + 1):
               a[i] = r - l + 1
       else:
           mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
           pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
           if pos != l:
               recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
           if pos != r:
               recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
   ```
   The `recursive_maximize_sum` function is supposed to maximize the sum of the array `a` within the range `[l, r]` using the operations described. However, it does not properly handle the `ops` list, which is not passed as a parameter. Additionally, the logic for determining when to apply `func_1` and when to recursively split the array seems flawed.

3. **Function `func_1` has incorrect logic:**
   ```python
   def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
       if l == r:
           if a[l] != 0:
               ops.append((l, l))
               a[l] = 0
           return
       func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
       if a[l] != r - l + 1:
           ops.append((l, r))
           for i in range(l, r + 1):
               a[i] = r - l + 1
           func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
   ```
   The `func_1` function is supposed to set the values in the range `[l, r]` to the MEX of the range. However, the logic for setting the values and the recursive calls seems incorrect. Specifically, setting `a[l] = 0` when `l == r` and `a[l] != 0` does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum. Additionally, the recursive calls and the logic for setting the values to `r - l + 1` are not correctly implemented to achieve the desired result.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. There are multiple cases where the program will not produce the expected output. For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program may not correctly identify the operations needed to maximize the sum to `105` as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
