### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and setting all its elements to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) of that subarray. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array while ensuring that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\).

Let's break down the logic and correctness of the given program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for modifying the array `a` in a specific way. It recursively processes the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero and sets it to zero if necessary.
   - If `l != r`, it first processes the subarray starting from `l + 1` to `r` recursively.
   - Then, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets the entire subarray from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and then returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - However, there is a critical issue: `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the `ops` list, which is necessary to store the operations. This means that the `ops` list will not be updated, and `func_2` will always return an empty list of operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function checks if the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays on either side of the maximum value.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints the results.
   - Due to the issue in `func_2`, `func_3` will not print the correct operations.

### Issues in the Program:
- The primary issue is that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list to it, so the operations are not recorded.
- The function `func_2` should pass the `ops` list to `recursive_maximize_sum` and ensure that the operations are correctly stored and returned.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly record or return the operations, which means it cannot provide the correct sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
