Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It returns (0, 0) in two unspecified cases. In the third case, it returns a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and a non-negative even integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) such that `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`. Here, `max_k` is `(n - 1) / 2` if `n` is odd, and `n` if `n` is even.**
