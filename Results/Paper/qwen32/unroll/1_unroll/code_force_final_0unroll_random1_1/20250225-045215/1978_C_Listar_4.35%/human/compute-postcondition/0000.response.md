The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_2()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the specific implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k` after the function call. However, we know that `n` will still be a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` will still be a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, as these constraints are part of the precondition and are not affected by the function call itself.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.**
