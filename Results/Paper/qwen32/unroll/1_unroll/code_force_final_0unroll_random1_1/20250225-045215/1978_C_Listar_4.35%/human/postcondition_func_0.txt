The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` as inputs. It returns a list of integers from 1 to `n` that has been modified based on the value of `k`. The modifications involve rearranging the elements of the list according to specific conditions derived from the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the list in its original order. Otherwise, elements are moved within the list following a specific pattern until `k` is reduced to 0 or all possible rearrangements are performed.
