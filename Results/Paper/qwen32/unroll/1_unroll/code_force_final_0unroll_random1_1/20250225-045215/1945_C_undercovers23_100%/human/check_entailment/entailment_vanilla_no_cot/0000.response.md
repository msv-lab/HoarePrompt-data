Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`:** The variable `pk` is supposed to represent the middle position of the village, which is `n // 2` for integer division, not `n / 2`. The latter would result in a floating-point number, which is not needed here.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentage:** The code calculates the percentage of zeros and ones in a way that does not align with the problem's requirement. Instead of calculating percentages, the code should check if the number of zeros on the left side is at least `ceil(i / 2)` and the number of ones on the right side is at least `ceil((n - i) / 2)`. The current implementation uses integer division and multiplication by 100, which is not appropriate.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The code does not correctly handle cases where the road is laid before the first house or after the last house. The logic for these cases is incorrect.

4. **Sorting and Selecting the Minimum:** The code sorts the list `final` but does not handle the case where `final` is empty correctly. It should consider the edge cases of laying the road before the first house or after the last house.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 and one >= (o - one) // 2:
                lst.append(i)
        if not lst:
            if z >= (n + 1) // 2:
                lst.append(0)
            elif o >= (n + 1) // 2:
                lst.append(n)
        lst.sort(key=lambda x: abs(n // 2 - x))
        print(lst[0])

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for placing the road and handles the edge cases correctly.
