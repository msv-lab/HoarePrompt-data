Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of houses and a string indicating the residents' preferences for living on either side of the street. For each test case, it calculates and prints the optimal position to split the houses such that at least 50% of the residents on each side of the split want to live on that side. If no such split exists, it prints either 0 or the total number of houses, depending on which side has a majority of residents.**
