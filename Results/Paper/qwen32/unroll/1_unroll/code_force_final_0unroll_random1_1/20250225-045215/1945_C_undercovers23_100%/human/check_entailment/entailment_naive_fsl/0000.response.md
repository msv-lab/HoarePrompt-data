Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description. Here are several issues:

1. **Percentage Calculation**: The program calculates percentages instead of checking the number of zeros and ones. Specifically, the conditions `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` are incorrect. The program should be checking whether the number of zeros is at least the ceiling of half the number of houses on the left side, and the number of ones is at least the ceiling of half the number of houses on the right side.

2. **Ceiling Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the ceiling of half the number of houses. Instead of using the ceiling function, the program uses integer division and percentage calculations, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house. Specifically, the program does not check if laying the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the conditions.

4. **Optimal Position Calculation**: The program does not correctly find the optimal position that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle of the village. The program uses a list to store valid positions and then finds the minimum difference, but this can be done more efficiently without storing all valid positions.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  001
  ```
- Expected Output: `0` (since laying the road before the first house satisfies the condition)
- Actual Output: `1` (the program incorrectly suggests laying the road after the first house)

To fix these issues, the program should:
1. Correctly count the number of zeros and ones on each side of the road.
2. Use the ceiling function to check the required number of zeros and ones.
3. Correctly handle edge cases where the road is laid before the first house or after the last house.
4. Efficiently find the optimal position that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle of the village.
