To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates from 1 to \( N-1 \) (which is 200000 in this case). For each iteration \( i \), it performs two main operations:

1. It adds the value of `pd[i-1]` to `pd[i]`.
2. It converts the integer \( i \) to a string, iterates over each character in that string, converts it back to an integer, and adds it to `pd[i]`.

Let's break down the steps:

- For \( i = 1 \): 
  - `pd[1] += pd[0]` → `pd[1] = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - `pd[1] += 1` → `pd[1] = 0 + 1 = 1`

- For \( i = 2 \):
  - `pd[2] += pd[1]` → `pd[2] = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `pd[2] += 2` → `pd[2] = 1 + 2 = 3`

- For \( i = 10 \):
  - `pd[10] += pd[9]` → `pd[10] = 0 + 45 = 45` (assuming `pd[9]` has been computed correctly)
  - `pd[10] += 1` → `pd[10] = 45 + 1 = 46`
  - `pd[10] += 0` → `pd[10] = 46 + 0 = 46`

This pattern continues up to \( i = 200000 \).

After all iterations, `pd[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of all the previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to \( i \).

Thus, the output state will be a list `pd` where each `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of all the previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to \( i \).

Output State: **`pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of all the previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to `i`, for `i` from 1 to 200000, and `pd[0]` remains 0.**
