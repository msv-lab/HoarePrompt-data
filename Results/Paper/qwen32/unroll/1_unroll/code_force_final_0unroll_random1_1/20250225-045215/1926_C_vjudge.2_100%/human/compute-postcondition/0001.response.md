Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `N` is 200001.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The conditions on `t` (1 <= `t` <= 10^4) and the other variables (`n` and `N`) remain unchanged.
