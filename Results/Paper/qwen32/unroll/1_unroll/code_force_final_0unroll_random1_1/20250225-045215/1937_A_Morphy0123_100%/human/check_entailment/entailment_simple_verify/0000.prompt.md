You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array \( a \) where initially \( a_i = i \) for each \( 1 \le i \le n \).
- We perform the operation `swap(k)` for each \( k \) from 2 to \( n \).
- In `swap(k)`, we find the largest divisor \( d \) of \( k \) (not equal to \( k \)) and swap \( a_d \) and \( a_k \).
- The goal is to find the position \( j \) such that \( a_j = 1 \) after performing all these operations.

### Key Observations:
- If \( n = 1 \), the array is `[1]`, and no operations are performed. So, the position of 1 is 1.
- For \( n \geq 2 \), the position of 1 will be influenced by the swaps. However, the final position of 1 is determined by the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \). This is because the swaps will eventually move 1 to the position corresponding to the largest power of 2.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \( n \). If \( n = 1 \), it correctly outputs 1. For \( n \geq 2 \), it calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( n \) and outputs \( 2^{\text{power}} \).

### Code Analysis:
```python
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Logarithm Calculation**: The code uses `log2(n)` to determine the power. However, `log2(n)` returns a floating-point value. The loop increments `power` until it is greater than or equal to `n` (which is a float), and then checks if `power` is exactly equal to `n`. This can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues.
2. **Integer Power Calculation**: The code should directly compute the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 2^k \leq n \). This can be done more reliably using integer arithmetic.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with floating-point arithmetic and the potential for incorrect results, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all inputs.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider \( n = 128 \):
- The correct largest power of 2 less than or equal to 128 is 7 (since \( 2^7 = 128 \)).
- The program calculates `log2(128) = 7.0` and correctly outputs 128.
- However, for \( n = 129 \):
  - `log2(129) ≈ 7.0038` and the loop increments `power` to 8, then decrements it to 7, outputting 128.
  - The correct largest power of 2 less than or equal to 129 is 7 (since \( 2^7 = 128 \)).

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect due to potential floating-point precision issues and incorrect handling of the largest power of 2 for certain values of \( n \).
