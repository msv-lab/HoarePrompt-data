Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems such that the sum of their difficulties equals `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of all sub-problem difficulties.

### Correct Approach

To maximize the balance, we need to find the largest integer `d` such that:
1. `d` divides `x` (i.e., `x % d == 0`).
2. We can form `n` sub-problems, each with a difficulty of at least `d`, and the sum of these difficulties equals `x`.

The key insight is that if `d` divides `x`, then `x = k * d` for some integer `k`. To form `n` sub-problems, we need to check if we can distribute the total difficulty `x` into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `d`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
1. It checks if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. This condition ensures that if we create `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `i`, the remaining difficulty can also be divided into multiples of `i`.
2. It also checks the same conditions for the corresponding quotient `x // i`.

If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the maximum balance `ans` with the current divisor `i` or `x // i`.

### Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case (x = 10, n = 3):**
   - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - Checking `i = 1`: `10 - 3 * 1 = 7` (not divisible by 1, but we can form 3 sub-problems with difficulty 1 and one with difficulty 7, but this does not maximize the GCD)
   - Checking `i = 2`: `10 - 3 * 2 = 4` (divisible by 2, so we can form 3 sub-problems with difficulty 2 and one with difficulty 4, but this does not satisfy the sum condition directly)
   - Checking `i = 5`: `10 - 3 * 5 = -5` (not valid)
   - Checking `i = 10`: `10 - 3 * 10 = -20` (not valid)
   - Checking `x // i = 10`: `10 - 3 * 1 = 7` (not divisible by 10)
   - Checking `x // i = 5`: `10 - 3 * 2 = 4` (divisible by 2, but not by 5)
   - Checking `x // i = 2`: `10 - 3 * 5 = -5` (not valid)
   - Checking `x // i = 1`: `10 - 3 * 10 = -20` (not valid)
   - The maximum valid `i` is 2, which can be verified by forming sub-problems with difficulties 4, 2, and 4.

2. **Second Test Case (x = 5, n = 5):**
   - Divisors of 5: 1, 5
   - Checking `i = 1`: `5 - 5 * 1 = 0` (valid, so we can form 5 sub-problems with difficulty 1)
   - Checking `i = 5`: `5 - 5 * 1 = 0` (valid, but we cannot form 5 sub-problems with difficulty 5)
   - The maximum valid `i` is 1, which can be verified by forming sub-problems with difficulties 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1.
