### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to decode a string `b` that was encoded based on a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a string `r` of unique characters from `b` in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from `r`. The task is to reverse this process and retrieve the original string `s`.

However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly perform this decoding process. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function attempts to replace characters in `s` by iterating through `s` and replacing each character with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` in reverse order. However, this replacement logic is flawed because it modifies the string `s` as it iterates over it. This means that subsequent characters in `s` that were originally the same as previously replaced characters will be replaced again, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The function incorrectly assumes that characters in `s` are replaced in a way that maintains the order of their first appearance. Instead, it should map each character in the encoded string `b` to its corresponding character in `r` (the unique characters in alphabetical order) and then use this mapping to decode `b` back to the original string `s`.

3. **Incorrect Return Value**: The function returns the concatenation of all unique characters in `s` in the order they were first encountered, which is not the original string `s`.

### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve creating a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character and then using this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the current implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
