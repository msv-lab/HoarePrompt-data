You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m <= n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost required to reach a specified final position, considering the costs provided in lists `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue with the minimum cost. The cost includes:
- `a_i` to swap directly with the person at position `i`.
- `b_k` for each person between positions `j` and `i` when swapping with the person at position `j`.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution iterates backwards from the last person in the queue to the first, calculating the total cost of moving Kirill to each position. It keeps track of the minimum cost to reach a position that is within the first `m` positions.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, representing the cumulative cost.
   - `best` is initialized to a very large number, representing the minimum cost found to reach a position within the first `m` positions.

2. **Loop through positions:**
   - The loop runs from the last person in the queue (`na_frente`) to the first person (`0`).
   - If the current position `v` is within the first `m` positions (`v <= pos_final`):
     - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the best cost found so far (`best`). If so, it updates `best`.
     - It adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost.
   - If the current position `v` is not within the first `m` positions:
     - It adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the `best` variable contains the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions, which is then printed.

### Issues in the Solution:
The main issue with the provided solution is that it does not correctly account for the cost of passing through people (`b_k`) when swapping with someone at position `j`. The current implementation adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost, but this does not accurately reflect the cost of swapping and passing through people.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the cost of swapping with a person at position `j` and the cost of passing through all people between `j` and `i`. A more appropriate approach would involve a dynamic programming solution or a greedy algorithm that correctly calculates the cost of each possible swap and pass-through.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed cost calculation logic.

**Correctness: False**
