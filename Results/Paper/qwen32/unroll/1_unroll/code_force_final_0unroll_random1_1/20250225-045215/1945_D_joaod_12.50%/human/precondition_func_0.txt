t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000. a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i. b is a list of n integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for each i. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
