You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order:
  - First, all odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
  - Next, all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest.
  - Then, all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest, and so forth.
- We need to determine the k-th card laid down for given n and k.

### Program Analysis:
The given program seems to be trying to determine the k-th card laid down by simulating the process described in the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).

2. **Generating the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` is generated based on the number of cards `n`. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current set.
   - `n` is then reduced by `m`, and `m` is appended to the list `L`.

3. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - `tot` is initialized to 0, and `pow` is initialized to 1.
   - The program iterates over the list `L` to find the range in which `k` falls.
   - If `tot < k <= tot + a`, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - `tot` is incremented by `a`, and `pow` is doubled in each iteration.

### Verification:
- The logic for generating the list `L` seems to be correct in terms of counting the number of odd-numbered cards at each step.
- The formula used to calculate the k-th card seems to be correct as well. It correctly identifies the position of `k` within the current set of cards and scales it appropriately based on the multiplier `pow`.

### Testing:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For `n = 7` and `k = 1` to `k = 7`, the program should output `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4` respectively, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the given program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
