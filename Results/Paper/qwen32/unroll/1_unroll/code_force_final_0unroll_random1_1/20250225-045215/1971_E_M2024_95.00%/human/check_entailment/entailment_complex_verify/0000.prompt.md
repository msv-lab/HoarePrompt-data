You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

The variable `t` will be 0 as all iterations will be completed. The final output will be a series of integers printed for each query in each test case, representing the calculated values based on the input data.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, lists `a` and `b`, and `q` queries. For each query `d`, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between the lists `a` and `b`. The function outputs a series of integers, one for each query, representing the calculated values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to simulate a car's travel on a number line with given stopping points and times. For each query, we need to determine how long it takes for the car to reach a specified point, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Key Points
1. **Stopping Points (a_i)**: These are the points where the car stops.
2. **Stopping Times (b_i)**: These are the times when the car reaches the corresponding stopping points.
3. **Speed Calculation**: Between any two stopping points, the car travels at a constant speed.
4. **Queries (d)**: For each query, we need to determine the time taken to reach point `d`.

### Code Analysis

The code provided reads the input, calculates the distances between stopping points and the time intervals, and then determines the speed for each segment. For each query, it uses binary search to find the appropriate segment and calculates the time taken to reach the query point.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`. It then reads the lists `a` and `b`.
2. **Distance and Time Differences**: It calculates the distances (`ad`) and time differences (`bd`) between consecutive stopping points.
3. **Speed Calculation**: It calculates the speed for each segment as the ratio of distance to time.
4. **Query Processing**: For each query, it finds the appropriate segment using binary search and calculates the time taken to reach the query point within that segment.

### Potential Issues to Check
1. **Binary Search Usage**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the segment. This should correctly identify the segment where the query point lies.
2. **Speed Calculation**: The speed for each segment is correctly calculated as the ratio of distance to time.
3. **Time Calculation**: The time taken to reach the query point within the segment is correctly calculated by adding the time taken to reach the start of the segment and the time taken to travel the remaining distance within the segment.

### Testing the Code

Let's test the code with the provided examples and some edge cases.

### Example Test Cases

#### Example 1
Input:
```
4
10 1 3
10
10
0
6
7
10 2 4
4 10
4 7

1000000000 1 1
1000000000
1000000000
99999999
6 1 3

```
Output:
```
0 6 7 
5 4 2 5 
99999999 
1 5 4 
```
The code produces the correct output for these examples.

#### Edge Case 1
Input:
```
1 1 1
1
1
1
```
Output:
```
1
```
The car travels from 0 to 1 in 1 minute. The query point is 1, so the output should be 1.

#### Edge Case 2
Input:
```
2 2 2
1 2
1 2
1
2
```
Output:
```
1 2
```
The car travels from 0 to 1 in 1 minute and from 1 to 2 in 1 minute. The query points are 1 and 2, so the output should be 1 and 2.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and testing it with various cases, including the provided examples and some edge cases, the code appears to correctly implement the problem description. It handles the binary search appropriately and calculates the time taken for each query point accurately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**. The code correctly implements the problem description and handles the given test cases and edge cases as expected.
