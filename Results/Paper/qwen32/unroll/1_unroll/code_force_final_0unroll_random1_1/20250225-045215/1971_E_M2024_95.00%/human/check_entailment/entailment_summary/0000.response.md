### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which represent the points and the corresponding times at those points respectively.
   - The program also reads `q` queries.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` with an extra `0` at the beginning to represent the starting point.
   - It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a` (`ad`) and `b` (`bd`).
   - It computes the speed `v` between each pair of consecutive points using the formula \( v = \frac{a_i - a_{i-1}}{b_i - b_{i-1}} \).

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `d`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the position `s` in the list `a` where `d` would fit.
   - If `d` exactly matches a point in `a`, it directly prints the corresponding time from `b`.
   - If `d` does not match a point in `a`, it calculates the time taken to reach `d` using the speed between the previous point `a[s-1]` and the current point `a[s]`. The formula used is:
     \[
     m = b[s-1] + \left(\frac{d - a[s-1]}{a[s] - a[s-1]}\right) \times (b[s] - b[s-1])
     \]
   - The result `m` is then rounded down to the nearest integer and printed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each query in a single line separated by spaces, and a newline after each test case.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the preprocessing steps and calculates the speeds between consecutive points.
- It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find the appropriate segment for each query.
- The formula for calculating the time for a point between two known points is correct and ensures that the time is rounded down to the nearest integer.
- The program handles multiple test cases and queries efficiently, adhering to the input and output constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
