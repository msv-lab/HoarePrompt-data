You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all strings b across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the mirrored characters from the `encoded` list based on the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a list of strings where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string formed by joining the mirrored characters from each string in the `encoded` list based on a predefined `mapping` dictionary.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string formed by joining the mirrored characters from the `encoded` list based on the `mapping` dictionary.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
