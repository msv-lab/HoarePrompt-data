Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the input list.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`) from the first element of the input list.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`).

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to decode a single encoded string.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first creates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` (the first character of `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second from the end, and so on).
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings for all test cases are collected in the `results` list.
   - The program prints the decoded strings, each on a new line.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Creating the Auxiliary String `r`:**
  - The program correctly constructs the string `r` by taking the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them alphabetically. This matches the problem's description.

- **Mapping Characters:**
  - The program creates a dictionary `mapping` that correctly maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This ensures that each character in the encoded string `b` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r` to form the original string `s`.

- **Decoding the Encoded String:**
  - The program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character in `b` using the `mapping` dictionary. This process reverses the encoding process described in the problem, thus correctly restoring the original string `s`.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program processes each test case independently and collects the results, which are then printed in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

**Correctness: True**
