Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Here are a few issues and a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The function `func_1` calculates the closest city incorrectly. It only checks the immediate neighbors and does not properly determine the closest city for each city. For example, if the cities are `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`, the closest city to city 1 (0) should be city 2 (8), but the function may not correctly determine this for all cases.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix Sums**: The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated using the incorrect values from `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not correctly identifying the closest cities, the prefix sums will be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

3. **Handling of Queries**: The program assumes that the cost to travel between cities can be calculated using the prefix sums derived from the incorrect closest city calculations. This will result in incorrect minimum coin calculations for the queries.

### Counterexample

Consider the input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:

```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the provided program will likely produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:

1. Determine the closest city for each city correctly.
2. Use these closest cities to calculate the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.
3. Handle the queries efficiently using these precomputed values.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided program does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
