### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates in ascending order, and the number of queries `m`.
   - For each query, it reads two cities `x` and `y`.

2. **Finding Closest Cities:**
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to determine the cost of moving to the closest city for each city.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost for each city to move to its closest city.
     - If the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, it sets the cost to `1`.
     - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.
   - The function is called twice: once for the original order of cities and once for the reversed order to get the cost of moving to the closest city in both directions.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the costs to move to the closest city in both forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to move to the closest city in the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to move to the closest city in the backward direction.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `x` to city `y`.
   - If `x < y`, it uses the forward prefix sums to calculate the cost.
   - If `x > y`, it uses the backward prefix sums to calculate the cost.

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue with the program is the logic in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to determine the cost of moving to the closest city, but it incorrectly calculates the cost for the last city in the list. Specifically:

- For the last city, the function sets `prog_cities[n-2]` to `1` because `forward` is set to `99999999`, which is always greater than `abs(cities[i] - back)`. This is incorrect because the last city does not have a next city, and its closest city should be the previous city.

### Correct Implementation for `func_1`:

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = cities[i - 1] if i > 0 else -99999999
        forward = cities[i + 1] if i < n - 2 else 99999999
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function. The corrected version of `func_1` should be used to ensure the program works as intended.

Correctness: **False**
