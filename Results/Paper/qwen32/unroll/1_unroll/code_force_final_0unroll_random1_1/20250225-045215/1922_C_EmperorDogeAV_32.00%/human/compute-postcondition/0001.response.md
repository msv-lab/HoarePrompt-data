In the given for loop, the loop variable is `i` and the range is `n - 1`. Therefore, the only states that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n - 1` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once). The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as the range function in Python starts from 0 by default.

The state of `cities`, `prog_cities`, and the queries are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted in this context.

State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities in each test case, `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1**.
