You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities in each test case. Additionally, each test case includes m queries, where m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` where `prog_cities[0]` is `cities[1] - cities[0]`, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if `cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i-1]`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `cities[i+1] - cities[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns `prog_cities`, a list of length `n - 1` where `prog_cities[0]` is `cities[1] - cities[0]`, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if `cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i-1]`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `cities[i+1] - cities[i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and an integer `n` representing the number of cities in each test case. The function calculates and returns `prog_cities`, a list of length `n - 1` where each element represents the minimum travel cost between consecutive cities based on specific conditions. Specifically, `prog_cities[0]` is the difference between the second and first city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if the difference between the next and current city is less than the difference between the current and previous city; otherwise, it is the difference between the next and current city.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `prog_cities`, a list of length `n - 1` where `prog_cities[0]` is `cities[1] - cities[0]`, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if `cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i-1]`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `cities[i+1] - cities[i]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
