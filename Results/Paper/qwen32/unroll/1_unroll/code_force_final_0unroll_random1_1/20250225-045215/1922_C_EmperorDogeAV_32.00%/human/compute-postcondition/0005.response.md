Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and an integer `n` representing the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` of length `n - 1`, where each element indicates the minimum travel cost between consecutive cities based on specific conditions. Specifically, `prog_cities[0]` is the difference between the second and first city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if the difference between the next and current city is less than the difference between the current and previous city; otherwise, it is the difference between the next and current city.**
