You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities in each test case. Additionally, each test case includes m queries, where m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` where `prog_cities[0]` is `cities[1] - cities[0]`, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if `cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i-1]`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `cities[i+1] - cities[i]`.

    #The program returns `prog_cities`, a list of length `n - 1` where `prog_cities[0]` is `cities[1] - cities[0]`, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if `cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i-1]`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `cities[i+1] - cities[i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and an integer `n` representing the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` of length `n - 1`, where each element indicates the minimum travel cost between consecutive cities based on specific conditions. Specifically, `prog_cities[0]` is the difference between the second and first city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if the difference between the next and current city is less than the difference between the current and previous city; otherwise, it is the difference between the next and current city.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query, which consists of two city indices `a` and `b`.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city.
   - For each city `i`, it determines the closest city by comparing the distances to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the next city is closer, it assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]` (indicating a cost of 1 coin to travel to the closest city). Otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the costs to travel to the closest city in both forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to travel to the closest city starting from the first city.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to travel to the closest city starting from the last city.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sums; if `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sums.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City:**
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the closest city costs. It should only consider the closest city in terms of the unique closest city constraint provided in the problem.
  - The current implementation does not correctly handle the unique closest city constraint. For example, if a city is equidistant from two other cities, it should not assign a cost of 1 coin.
  
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum calculation assumes that the cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin or the distance to the next city. This is incorrect based on the problem description.
  - The correct approach should involve calculating the shortest path using the unique closest city constraint.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
