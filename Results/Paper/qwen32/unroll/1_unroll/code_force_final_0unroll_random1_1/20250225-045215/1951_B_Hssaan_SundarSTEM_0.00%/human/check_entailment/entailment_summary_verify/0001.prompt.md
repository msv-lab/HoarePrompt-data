You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It then performs specific swaps and calculations to determine the maximum number of consecutive elements less than or equal to the element at the k-th position after the swaps. The function outputs this maximum number for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Setup:** 
   - There are `n` cows, each with a unique Cowdeforces rating.
   - The tournament consists of `n-1` matches where the winner of each match moves on to the next round.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of wins for the cow at position `k` by optionally swapping it with another cow once.

2. **Approach:**
   - The program considers two scenarios:
     - **Scenario 1:** The cow at position `k` is swapped with the cow at position 1.
     - **Scenario 2:** The cow at position `k` is swapped with the cow that would have lost to the cow at position `k` in the first scenario.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the position `k` of the cow in question.
   - It then reads the list of ratings.
   - **Scenario 1:**
     - Swap the cow at position `k` with the cow at position 1.
     - Simulate the tournament to count the number of wins for the cow at position `k`.
     - Swap back to the original positions.
   - **Scenario 2:**
     - Identify the cow that would have lost to the cow at position `k` in the first scenario.
     - Swap the cow at position `k` with this identified cow.
     - Simulate the tournament to count the number of wins for the cow at position `k`.
   - The program outputs the maximum number of wins from the two scenarios.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Scenario 1:**
  - The program correctly simulates the tournament after swapping the cow at position `k` with the cow at position 1.
  - It counts the number of wins correctly for this scenario.

- **Scenario 2:**
  - The program identifies the cow that would have lost to the cow at position `k` in the first scenario.
  - It then swaps the cow at position `k` with this identified cow.
  - The simulation logic for counting wins is similar to Scenario 1 but might have some issues.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Scenario 2:**
  - The logic for identifying the cow that would have lost to the cow at position `k` in the first scenario is flawed.
  - The program uses `j` to find the position where the cow at position `k` would have lost in the first scenario, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where the cow at position `k` wins all matches.
  - The swap and subsequent simulation logic in Scenario 2 might not correctly simulate the tournament due to incorrect handling of positions and ratings.

### Example:
Let's consider the second test case from the problem statement:
- `n = 6`, `k = 5`
- Ratings: `7 2 727 10 12 13`
- In Scenario 1, the cow at position 5 is swapped with the cow at position 1.
  - The cow at position 5 (rating 12) is now at position 1.
  - Simulation results in 2 wins for the cow at position 5.
- In Scenario 2, the program identifies the cow that would have lost to the cow at position 5 in the first scenario.
  - The cow at position 5 (rating 12) is now at position 3 (since the cow at position 1 loses to the cow at position 3).
  - The simulation logic might not correctly simulate the tournament due to incorrect handling of positions and ratings.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly Scenario 2, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
