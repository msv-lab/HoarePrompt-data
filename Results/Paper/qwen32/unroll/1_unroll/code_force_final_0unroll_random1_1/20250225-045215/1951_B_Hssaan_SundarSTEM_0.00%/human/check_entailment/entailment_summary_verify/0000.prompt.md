You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):

        s = list(map(int, input().split()))

            else:
                ans += 1
        p = j
        (s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])
        ans1 = 0

        z = 0

                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        print(max(ans, ans1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It then performs specific swaps and calculations to determine the maximum number of consecutive elements less than or equal to the element at the k-th position after the swaps. The function outputs this maximum number for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for cow k, either by doing nothing or by making one optimal swap. Let's go through the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Initial Swap Handling**:
   - The program swaps cow k with the first cow (index 0) and then calculates the number of wins for this scenario. However, this swap might not be optimal, and the program does not consider other possible swaps that might yield more wins.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic for Counting Wins**:
   - The loop for counting wins after the initial swap is incorrect. It breaks the loop when it encounters a cow with a higher rating, which is correct, but the logic for counting wins when the cow has the highest rating so far is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the cow's rating is the highest in the sequence.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Subsequent Swaps**:
   - After calculating the wins for the initial swap, the program attempts to swap cow k with the cow at position `p` (the last position where cow k could have won) and then calculates the number of wins. However, this logic is incorrect and does not consider other possible swaps that might yield more wins.

4. **Lack of Consideration for All Possible Swaps**:
   - The program does not consider all possible swaps that could result in the maximum number of wins for cow k. It only considers swapping with the first cow and with the cow at position `p`, which might not be optimal.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a test case where the program will fail:

**Test Case**:
```
3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1
2
0
```

**Program Output**:
The program might not output the expected results for all test cases due to the issues mentioned above.

**Counterexample**:
Consider the following test case:
```
3
6 2
10 12 11 8 3 14
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Explanation**:
- If cow 2 (with rating 12) is swapped with cow 5 (with rating 14), the sequence becomes [10, 14, 11, 8, 3, 12].
- The matches will be:
  1. 10 vs 14 (14 wins)
  2. 14 vs 11 (14 wins)
  3. 14 vs 8 (14 wins)
  4. 14 vs 3 (14 wins)
  5. 14 vs 12 (14 wins)
- Cow 2 (originally with rating 12) wins 0 matches in this scenario.
- However, if cow 2 (with rating 12) is swapped with cow 3 (with rating 11), the sequence becomes [10, 11, 12, 8, 3, 14].
- The matches will be:
  1. 10 vs 11 (11 wins)
  2. 11 vs 12 (12 wins)
  3. 12 vs 8 (12 wins)
  4. 12 vs 3 (12 wins)
  5. 12 vs 14 (14 wins)
- Cow 2 (originally with rating 12) wins 2 matches in this scenario.
- The program might not consider this optimal swap and might output an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
