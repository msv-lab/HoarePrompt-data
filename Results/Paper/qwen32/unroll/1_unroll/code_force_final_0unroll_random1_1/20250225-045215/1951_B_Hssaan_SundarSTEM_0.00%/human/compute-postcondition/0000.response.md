In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which is not explicitly named but is used to determine the number of iterations.

Let's break down the requirements and the state adjustments needed:

1. **Variable `_`**: This is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range. It does not need any specific state adjustment as it is automatically assigned by the `range` function.

2. **`int(input())`**: This part of the loop head is responsible for determining the number of iterations. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `input()` returns a string representation of an integer within this range.

Given that the state before the loop starts includes `t` as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input function returns a string representation of `t` for the loop to execute correctly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input function must return the string representation of `t`**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, as required by the problem statement.
