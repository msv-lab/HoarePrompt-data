Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, it accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500. It returns the result for each test case based on the content of the string `s`.**
