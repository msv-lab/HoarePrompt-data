Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The sequence `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]` (which is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`) allows for the formation of any sum that is a combination of its elements, including the sum `k`. This means that it fails to meet the requirement that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.

To solve the problem correctly, the sequence needs to be constructed in a way that avoids forming the sum `k` while still allowing for all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) to be formed by subsequences. This requires a more sophisticated approach than simply using powers of 2.
