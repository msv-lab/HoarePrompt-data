To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the list `cases`, which contains tuples of integers `(n, k)`. The loop will execute if `cases` contains at least one tuple.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `sequence` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216].

The loop will execute if `cases` has at least one tuple `(n, k)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `cases` is not empty.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `cases` must contain at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `sequence` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]**
