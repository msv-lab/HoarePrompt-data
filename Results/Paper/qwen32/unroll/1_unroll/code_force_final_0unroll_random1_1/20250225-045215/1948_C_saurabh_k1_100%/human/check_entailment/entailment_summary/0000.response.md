### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the movement rules described in the problem. However, the logic implemented in the program does not fully capture the necessary conditions for the robot to reach the target. The current program checks for a specific pattern of '<' and '>' characters but does not account for all possible valid paths the robot could take.

The program iterates over the columns with an odd index and checks if there are '<' characters at positions where they would cause a conflict (i.e., both the current and next/previous positions in the same column or adjacent column have '<'). If such a conflict is found, it prints "No". If no conflicts are found, it prints "Yes". However, this logic does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the rules:
1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. It must make a move (left, right, up, or down).
3. It then follows the arrow in the cell it lands in.
4. The process repeats until the robot either reaches (2, n) or enters a cycle (indicating it cannot reach the target).

The provided program does not simulate these steps and only checks for a specific pattern of '<' and '>' characters, which is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.
