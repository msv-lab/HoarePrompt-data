You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly n characters, each of which is either '<' or '>'. There are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: a sequence of "Yes" and "No" responses, one for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing '<' and '>' characters. It determines if it's possible to pair each '<' with a '>' without any crossing arrows and outputs "Yes" if possible, otherwise "No" for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The robot starts at position (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The robot can move either left, right, up, or down, and then it must follow the arrow in the cell it lands in. The goal is to determine if there exists a sequence of moves that allows the robot to reach (2, n).

### Key Observations:
1. The robot can move to (2, 1) from (1, 1) by moving down.
2. From (2, 1), the robot can only move right or left and then follow the arrow.
3. The robot needs to ensure that it can eventually reach (2, n) by navigating through the grid following the arrows.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks for specific conditions in the grid to determine if the robot can reach (2, n). Specifically, it iterates through the columns (starting from the second column and skipping every other column) and checks for certain configurations of arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching (2, n).

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic Flaw**: The program only checks for specific configurations of arrows (i.e., `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`) and concludes that the robot cannot reach (2, n) if these configurations are found. However, this logic is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios where the robot might be able to reach (2, n).
   
2. **Missing Cases**: The program does not consider other possible moves and configurations that could allow the robot to reach (2, n). For example, it does not account for scenarios where the robot might need to move up or down multiple times or follow a different sequence of arrows.

3. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The program prints 'No' and 'yes' (with different cases), which is acceptable according to the problem statement, but the logic inside the program needs to be correct first.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
