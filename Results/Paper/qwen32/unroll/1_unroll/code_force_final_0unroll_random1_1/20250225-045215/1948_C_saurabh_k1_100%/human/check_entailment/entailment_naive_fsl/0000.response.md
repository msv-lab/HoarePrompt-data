Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The current implementation only checks for a specific condition related to arrows at odd indices and their neighbors, but it does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid as described in the problem statement.

Here is a counterexample where the given program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><>>
><><
```
**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```
**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

Explanation for the counterexample: 
The robot can start at (1, 1) and follow the path (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4). This path shows that the robot can reach (2, 4). However, the given program will print "NO" for this input because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and instead only checks for a specific condition that is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

The program needs to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the rules provided in the problem description.
