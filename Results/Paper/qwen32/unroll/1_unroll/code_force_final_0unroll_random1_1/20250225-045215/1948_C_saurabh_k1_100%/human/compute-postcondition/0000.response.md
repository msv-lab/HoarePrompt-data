Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly n characters, each of which is either '<' or '>'. There are no arrows pointing outside the grid.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The constraints on `t` and the conditions for `n` and the grid remain the same as in the initial state.
