You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts at the minimum cost. The options are:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles (promotion price).

The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

The logic in the program is as follows:
1. If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, then it is always cheaper or equal to buy yogurts in pairs at the promotion price. Therefore, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, then Maxim can buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and the last yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Steps of the Program
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It checks if `2 * a < b` to determine if it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually.
- If `n` is even, it calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b`.
- If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example.

**Test Case 1:**
- `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price: cost = `9`.

**Test Case 2:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually: cost = `9 + 5 = 14`.

**Test Case 3:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `3 * 5 = 15`.

**Test Case 4:**
- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly computes the minimum cost for all test cases.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts considering the promotion price.

Correctness: **True**
