Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem statement requires us to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.

Here's a breakdown of the logic the program uses:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts).

2. **Determining the Minimum Cost:**
   - The program first checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`). If it is, it means buying yogurts at regular price is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `n * a` and prints it.
   - If the above condition is not met, it then checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price, so the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost for the largest even number of yogurts less than `n` and adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price. This is done by calculating `(n // 2) * b + a`.

Let's verify this logic against the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `2 * a = 10` is greater than `b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `2 * 9 = 18 / 2 = 9` (correct).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `2 * a = 10` is greater than `b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14` (correct).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `3 * 5 = 15` (correct).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `4 * 5 = 20` (correct).

However, there is a mistake in the code. The logic `if B * 2 < C` should actually be `if a * 2 <= b` because if the regular price for two yogurts is less than or equal to the promotional price, it's more economical to buy them regularly. This ensures that the program correctly handles the scenario where the regular price for two yogurts is exactly equal to the promotional price.

Given the above analysis, the program's logic is mostly correct, but it has a small mistake in the condition check for regular price vs promotional price. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
