Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.

### Problem Analysis Recap
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts at the minimum cost, given the following options:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles (promotion price).

### Program Analysis Recap
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion). The logic is as follows:
1. If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, it is always cheaper or equal to buy yogurts in pairs at the promotion price. Therefore, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and the last yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Steps of the Program Recap
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It checks if `2 * a < b` to determine if it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually.
- If `n` is even, it calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b`.
- If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example.

**Test Case 1:**
- `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price: cost = `9`.

**Test Case 2:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually: cost = `9 + 5 = 14`.

**Test Case 3:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `3 * 5 = 15`.

**Test Case 4:**
- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `4 * 5 = 20`.

However, there is a mistake in the original assessment for Test Case 3 and Test Case 4. Let's re-evaluate these cases:

**Test Case 3 (Re-evaluated):**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually: cost = `11 + 5 = 16`. But the correct logic should be to buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually: cost = `11 + 5 = 16`. However, the correct cost should be `11 + 5 = 16` but the provided output is `15`. This means the program logic should be rechecked.

**Test Case 4 (Re-evaluated):**
- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price twice: cost = `11 * 2 = 22`. But the correct logic should be to buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price twice: cost = `11 * 2 = 22`. However, the correct cost should be `11 * 2 = 22` but the provided output is `20`. This means the program logic should be rechecked.

### Correct Implementation
The correct implementation should be:
1. If `2 * a <= b`, buy all yogurts individually: cost = `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even and `2 * a > b`, buy all yogurts in pairs: cost = `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd and `2 * a > b`, buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and the last yogurt individually: cost = `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Program Code Re-evaluation
The program code should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a <= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                print((n // 2) * b)
            else:
                print(((n - 1) // 2) * b + a)
```

### Conclusion
The original assessment is incorrect because the logic for determining the minimum cost is flawed. The correct logic should be used as described above.

Final: **False**
