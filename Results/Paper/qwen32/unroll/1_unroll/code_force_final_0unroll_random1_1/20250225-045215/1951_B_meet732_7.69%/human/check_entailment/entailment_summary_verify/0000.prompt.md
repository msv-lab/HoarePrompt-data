You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if k == 14:
        print(ind)
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of the number of cows `n`, the 1-based index `k` of a specific cow, and a list of the cows' ratings. For each test case, the function identifies up to two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k`. Based on the indices of these cows, it returns a value representing the position of the cow with the next higher rating relative to the cow at index `k`, or the total number of cows minus one if no such cow exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are some specific problems and counterexamples:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Index Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `a` but `n` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`. This will result in a `NameError`.
   - The variable `k` is decremented by 1 to convert it to a 0-based index, but the function `func_1` does not receive `k` as a parameter, which means it cannot determine the original position of the cow `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Wins**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It tries to find the first two cows with ratings greater than the cow at position `k` and then makes decisions based on their positions. This does not correctly simulate the tournament process and does not account for the possibility of swapping the cow `k` with another cow to maximize wins.
   - The logic does not correctly handle the scenario where cow `k` is in position 1 or position `n`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where cow `k` is already in the best possible position to win the maximum number of matches.
   - The code does not consider the possibility of swapping cow `k` with another cow to improve its chances of winning more matches.

4. **Incorrect Output for Sample Test Cases**:
   - For the first sample test case:
     ```
     6 1
     12 10 14 11 8 3
     ```
     The expected output is `1`, but the code does not produce this output.
   - For the second sample test case:
     ```
     6 5
     7 2 727 10 12 13
     ```
     The expected output is `2`, but the code does not produce this output.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the tournament process, considering both the scenario where cow `k` does not swap and the scenario where cow `k` swaps with another cow to maximize its wins. The program should then return the maximum number of wins possible for cow `k` in either scenario.
