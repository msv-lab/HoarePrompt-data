Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of the number of cows `n`, the 1-based index `k` of a specific cow, and a list of the cows' ratings. For each test case, the function identifies up to two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k`. Based on the indices of these cows, it returns a value representing the position of the cow with the next higher rating relative to the cow at index `k`, or the total number of cows minus one if no such cow exists.**
