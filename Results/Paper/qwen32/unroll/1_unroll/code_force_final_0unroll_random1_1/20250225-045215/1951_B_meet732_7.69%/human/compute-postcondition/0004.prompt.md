Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two parts: the first part is a list `[n, k]` where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is your cow's 1-based index, and the second part is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is assigned the value `a[k]` for each test case. `ind` is an empty list. `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
