Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, an integer `k` representing a specific condition or parameter related to the list, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**
