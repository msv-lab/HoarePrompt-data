Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which appear to be related to modular arithmetic, specifically for finding modular inverses. However, these functions do not directly address the problem description, which requires counting the number of permutations based on given prefix and suffix maximums.

The problem description requires a more complex algorithm to determine the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. The provided functions do not implement this logic and thus do not solve the problem as described.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to use dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics to count the valid permutations based on the given constraints.

Here is a brief outline of the steps that would be required to solve the problem correctly:

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the details for each test case.
2. For each test case, determine the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
3. Use combinatorial techniques or dynamic programming to count these permutations.
4. Output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
