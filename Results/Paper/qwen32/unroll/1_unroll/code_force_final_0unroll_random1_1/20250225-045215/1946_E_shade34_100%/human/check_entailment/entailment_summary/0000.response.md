### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. Let's break down the logic and the correctness of the program based on the provided execution summaries and the problem description.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m1`, `m2`, the list of prefix maximum indices `p`, and the list of suffix maximum indices `s`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `p[-1]` is equal to the first suffix maximum index `s[0]`, the first prefix maximum index `p[0]` is `1`, and the last suffix maximum index `s[-1]` is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints `0` because it's impossible to have such a permutation.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - The program uses precomputed factorials stored in the `facts` list to perform combinatorial calculations.
   - It calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the suffix maximums using the combination formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`.
   - It also calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the prefix maximums in a similar manner.
   - It multiplies these combinations together to get the total number of valid permutations for each test case.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - All calculations are done modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.

#### Analysis of the Functions:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function calculates the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for two numbers `a` and `b`, which is used in modular inverse calculations.
- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function calculates the modular inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` and multiplies it with `a` to perform division under modulo.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the initial checks to ensure the feasibility of the permutation.
- It uses the combination formula correctly to count the number of valid permutations.
- The modular arithmetic is applied consistently throughout the calculations.
- The precomputed factorials (`facts` list) are used efficiently, which is crucial given the large constraints (`n` up to `2 * 10^5`).

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
