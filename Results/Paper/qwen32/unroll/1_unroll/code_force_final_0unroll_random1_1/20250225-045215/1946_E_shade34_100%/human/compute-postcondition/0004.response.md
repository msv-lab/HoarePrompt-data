To solve this, we need to understand the function `func_1(b, a)` and how it affects the values of `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we will assume a common scenario where `func_1` might perform a typical operation such as division and modulus, which is a common pattern in functions dealing with two integers.

Assuming `func_1(b, a)` returns the quotient and remainder of `b` divided by `a`, we can proceed with the following:

- `c` will be the quotient of `b` divided by `a`.
- `d` will be the remainder of `b` divided by `a`.

Given the initial state that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is less than `b`, we can calculate the output state as follows:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is less than `b`; `c` is the quotient of `b` divided by `a`; `d` is the remainder of `b` divided by `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `a` and `b` remain non-negative integers with `b` not equal to 0 and `a` still less than `b`. The variable `c` is assigned the quotient when `b` is divided by `a`, and `d` is assigned the remainder of that division.
