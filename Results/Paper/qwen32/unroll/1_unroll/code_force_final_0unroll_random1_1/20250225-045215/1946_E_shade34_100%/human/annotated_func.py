        #The program returns a tuple where the first element is the remainder of `b` divided by `a` (which is `d`), and the second element is the quotient of `b` divided by `a` (which is `c`).

    if (a % b == 0) :

    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, the function returns either (1, 0) if `b` is 0, or a tuple representing the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for `a` and `b`. Specifically, it returns a tuple `(x, y)` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the value of `c * a % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and `a` is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes a value by multiplying `a` with the first value returned from `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and then takes the result modulo 1000000007. The function returns this computed value.
