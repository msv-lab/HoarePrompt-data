To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(b, a % b)` returns. Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we can infer the return values `c` and `d` based on the given context and typical use cases.

Given the context, `func_1` might be implementing a recursive function similar to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). In such a case, `func_1` would return the GCD and some coefficient values. However, without the exact definition, we can only assume that `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.

The task is to return `d` and `c - a // b * d`. Since we don't have the exact values of `c` and `d`, we will express the output in terms of `c` and `d`.

Let's break it down:

1. `a // b` is the integer division of `a` by `b`.
2. `a % b` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
3. `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.

Given these points, the return statement `return d, c - a // b * d` will return `d` and the calculated value `c - a // b * d`.

Output State: **The program returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`**.
