You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program:
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        array2 = []
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the differences in the list `m` and compares it to `f`. It prints 'Yes' if the calculated sum plus a penalty term is less than `f`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The input values remain unchanged after processing each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown
Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific times `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` with his phone, which has an initial charge `f`. The phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time and `b` units of charge each time it is turned off and on. The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through each test case and checking if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumed by sending messages without turning the phone off and on.
   - It then iterates through the list of message times:
     - For the first message, it checks if the time to send the message is less than `b/a`. If true, it calculates the charge consumed by sending the message at that time and appends it to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages, it checks if the time gap between consecutive messages is less than `b/a`. If true, it calculates the charge consumed by sending the message at that time and appends it to `array2`.
   - After processing all messages, it calculates the total charge consumed by summing the charges in `array2` and adding the charge consumed by turning the phone off and on for the remaining messages (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).
   - It then checks if the total charge consumed is less than the initial charge `f`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The program does not account for the possibility of turning the phone off and on at optimal times to minimize charge consumption. It only considers turning the phone off and on when the time gap between messages is less than `b/a`. This is incorrect because Stepan can choose to turn the phone off and on at any time to optimize charge usage.
   - The program does not consider the initial charge `f` and the charge consumption `a` and `b` in a way that optimizes the sequence of actions (turning on/off and sending messages).

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the process of sending messages and managing the phone's charge. It does not account for the possibility of running out of charge between messages or at any point.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of sending messages and manage the phone's charge. At each message time, we should decide whether to turn the phone off and on or to keep it on based on the remaining charge and the charge consumption.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.
