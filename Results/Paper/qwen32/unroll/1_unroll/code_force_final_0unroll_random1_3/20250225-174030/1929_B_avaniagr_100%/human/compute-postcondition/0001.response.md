To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each line of input and what it prints based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Here's a breakdown of the loop logic:

1. For each line of input (excluding the first line which is the number of test cases `t`), the values of `n` and `k` are read.
2. Depending on the value of `k`, the loop prints different results:
   - If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - If `k == 4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`.
   - If `k == 4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`.

The initial state describes `t` test cases, each with specific values of `n` and `k`. The output state will be a series of print statements, one for each test case, reflecting the computed result based on the conditions above.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the output state will be a list of integers, each corresponding to the output of a test case.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided in the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the format and the logic applied.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case based on the given conditions.**
