In the given task, the for loop iterates over the number of input datasets provided through standard input. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which indicates the number of iterations (sets of input data) to process.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that there is at least one set of input data available for processing. Therefore, the number of datasets read from standard input must be greater than 0.

State: **The number of datasets (from `int(sys.stdin.readline())`) must be greater than 0**.
