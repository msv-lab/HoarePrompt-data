### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, using at most `3n` queries. The provided program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. 

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function takes four indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and sends a query to the interactor. It then reads the comparison result (`<`, `=`, or `>`) and returns it.
- This function is correctly implemented as per the problem's requirements.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function takes two indices `a` and `b` and prints the answer in the specified format.
- This function is also correctly implemented as per the problem's requirements.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Initialization**:
  - Reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.
  - If `n` is 2, it directly calls `func_2(0, 1)` because the maximum XOR for a permutation of two elements is always 1.
- **Finding the maximum index**:
  - Iterates through all indices and compares the bitwise OR of `p[0]` and `p[max_index]` with `p[0]` and `p[i]` for each `i`.
  - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_index` to `i`. This step is intended to find the index with the maximum value in the permutation.
- **Finding the minimum index**:
  - Initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
  - Iterates through all indices and compares the bitwise OR of `p[max_index]` and `p[min_indices[0]]` with `p[max_index]` and `p[i]` for each `i`.
  - If the result is `<`, it resets `min_indices` to `[i]`. If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`. This step is intended to find the indices with the minimum value in the permutation.
  - Further iterates through `min_indices` to find the exact minimum index `min_index` by comparing `p[min_index]` with `p[i]` for each `i` in `min_indices`.
- **Output**:
  - Calls `func_2(max_index, min_index)` to print the indices that maximize the XOR.

#### Analysis:
- The logic for finding the maximum index and the minimum index seems flawed. The goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized, not necessarily the maximum and minimum values in the permutation.
- The XOR operation is maximized when the two numbers have the most differing bits. The current approach does not guarantee that the selected indices will have the maximum XOR value.
- The provided code does not seem to implement a strategy that ensures the maximum XOR value is found within the constraint of `3n` queries.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee finding the indices that maximize the XOR value of the permutation elements.

**Correctness: False**
