Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
2. \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Mathematical Insight

The condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) can be rewritten as:
\[ \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \in \mathbb{Z} \]

Let's denote \( \gcd(a, b) = d \), then \( a = dx \) and \( b = dy \) where \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). The condition becomes:
\[ \frac{dx + dy}{dy \cdot d} = \frac{x + y}{dy} \in \mathbb{Z} \]
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy} \]

This means that \( y \) must be a divisor of \( x + y \) and \( x \) must be a multiple of \( d \).

### Analysis of the Program

The provided program has a different approach and logic. Let's break it down:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   count = 2
   ans = n
   ```
   - `count` starts at 2, and `ans` is initialized to `n`, which means it counts pairs where \( b = 1 \).

2. **Loop**:
   ```python
   while count <= m:
       countmins = int(count - 1)
       g = int(n / count)
       if g < countmins:
           break
       g -= countmins
       ans += int(g / count) + 1
       count += 1
   ```
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `count` (which seems to represent `b`).
   - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - `g` is decremented by `countmins`.
   - `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(int(ans))
   ```

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
- **Initialization**: The initial value of `ans` being set to `n` is incorrect as it does not account for all valid pairs where \( b = 1 \) and \( a + 1 \) is a multiple of \( 1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) \) (which is always true).
- **Loop Condition**: The loop condition and the logic inside the loop do not correctly iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` to check the given condition.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic inside the loop and the initialization of `ans` are incorrect, and the program does not properly count all valid pairs (a, b).

Correctness: **False**
