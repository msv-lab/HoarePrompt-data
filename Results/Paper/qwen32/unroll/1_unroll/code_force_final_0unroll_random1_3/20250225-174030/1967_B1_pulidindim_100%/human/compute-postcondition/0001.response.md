The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`, and the loop will iterate over these numbers. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts; it will be initialized by the `range` function during the first iteration.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
