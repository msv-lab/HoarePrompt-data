You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Provided Program Analysis
The program provided is:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
    - `ans = n` initializes the count of valid pairs with \( b = 1 \), because for any \( a \) from 1 to \( n \), \( a + 1 \) is a multiple of \( 1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1 \).

2. **Loop for \( b \geq 2 \)**:
    - The loop starts from \( count = 2 \) and goes up to \( m \).
    - For each \( b = count \), it calculates `countmins = count - 1`.
    - It then calculates `g = n // count`, which represents the maximum possible \( a \) such that \( a + b \) could be a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
    - If `g < countmins`, it breaks out of the loop, implying that no valid \( a \) can be found for this \( b \) (since the maximum possible \( a \) is less than the minimum required \( a \)).
    - Otherwise, it subtracts `countmins` from `g` and adds the integer division of `g // count + 1` to `ans`.

### Checking for Correctness
The provided program seems to be based on a specific logic for counting valid pairs. However, it is not immediately clear if this logic correctly counts all valid pairs for all possible values of \( n \) and \( m \).

### Testing the Program with Examples
Let's test the program with the provided example inputs to see if it produces the correct outputs.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Example 2:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Program Output: `3` (Correct)

#### Example 3:
- Input: `3 5`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Program Output: `4` (Correct)

#### Example 4:
- Input: `10 8`
- Expected Output: `14`
- Program Output: `14` (Correct)

#### Example 5:
- Input: `100 1233`
- Expected Output: `153`
- Program Output: `153` (Correct)

#### Example 6:
- Input: `1000000 1145141`
- Expected Output: `1643498`
- Program Output: `1643498` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program seems to produce the correct output for the provided examples. However, the logic of the program is not straightforward and it's not entirely clear if it handles all edge cases correctly without an in-depth mathematical proof or additional testing.

### Edge Case Consideration
Let's consider a few edge cases:

#### Edge Case 1:
- Input: `1 2`
- Expected Output: `2` (Pairs: (1,1), (1,2))
- Program Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Edge Case 2:
- Input: `2 1`
- Expected Output: `2` (Pairs: (1,1), (2,1))
- Program Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Edge Case 3:
- Input: `10 1`
- Expected Output: `10` (Pairs: (1,1), (2,1), ..., (10,1))
- Program Output: `10` (Correct)

### Final Verdict
Based on the provided examples and edge cases, the program appears to be correct. However, without a rigorous mathematical proof or additional extensive testing, we cannot be 100% certain. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program seems to work correctly.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for the provided examples and edge cases. While a rigorous proof of correctness is not provided, the results match the expected outputs for various test cases.
