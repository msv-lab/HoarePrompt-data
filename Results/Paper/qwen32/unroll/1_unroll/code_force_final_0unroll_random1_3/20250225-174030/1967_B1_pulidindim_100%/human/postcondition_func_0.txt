The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer `ans` based on a specific algorithm involving division and summation operations. The final state of the program is a series of printed integers, each corresponding to the result of the calculation for a respective test case.
