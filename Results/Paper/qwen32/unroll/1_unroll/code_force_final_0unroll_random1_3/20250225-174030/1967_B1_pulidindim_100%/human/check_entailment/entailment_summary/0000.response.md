### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the implementation in the program does not correctly address the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. The value of `ans` is initialized to `n` because every number \(a\) paired with \(b=1\) will satisfy the condition \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

2. The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`, then computes `g` as the integer division of `n` by `count`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.

3. If `g` is not less than `countmins`, it subtracts `countmins` from `g` and adds the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1 to `ans`.

4. The loop increments `count` and continues until `count` exceeds `m`.

The logic in the loop does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly checked. Instead, the program performs a series of operations that do not correspond to the problem's constraints.

Given the provided example outputs, it is clear that the program does not produce the correct results. For instance, for the input `10 8`, the correct output should be `14`, but the program does not produce this output.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect as it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
