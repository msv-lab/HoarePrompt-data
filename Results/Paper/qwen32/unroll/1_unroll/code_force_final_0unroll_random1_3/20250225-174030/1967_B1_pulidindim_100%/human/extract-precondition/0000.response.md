Precondition: **Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test cases exceeds 2 · 10^6.**
