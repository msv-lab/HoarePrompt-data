You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string, subtracting one if there is at least one '01' transition.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a binary string, determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that can be cut from it such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).
- Each character must lie in exactly one piece.
- The pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string.
- All pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Explanation of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 1 because at least one piece is needed.
   - `flag` is used to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
   
2. **Loop through the string**:
   - The loop iterates through the string from the first character to the second last character.
   - If a transition from '0' to '1' is found, the `flag` is set to `True`.
   - If a change in character is found (i.e., `s[j] != s[j + 1]`), it increments the `count` by 1.
   
3. **Adjust count based on flag**:
   - If a '0' to '1' transition is found (`flag` is `True`), it decrements the `count` by 1.
   - This adjustment is based on the assumption that the last piece can be merged with the previous piece if it starts with '1' and the previous piece ends with '0'.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic of adjusting `count` based on the `flag` seems flawed. The program assumes that if there is a '0' to '1' transition, the last piece can always be merged with the previous piece, which is not always true.
- Consider the case where there are multiple transitions, and the string is something like "010101". The program would incorrectly reduce the count by 1, leading to an incorrect result.

### Test Cases:
Let's check a few test cases to see if the program works correctly.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `11010`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Program Output: `3` (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `00000000`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `10`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: `0001111`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: `0110`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Test Case 7:
- Input: `010101`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Program Output: `2` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the test case `010101`. The expected output is `3`, but the program outputs `2`. This indicates that the program does not handle all cases correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly reduces the `count` by 1 if there is a '0' to '1' transition, which is not always valid. This leads to incorrect results for certain inputs, such as `010101`.
