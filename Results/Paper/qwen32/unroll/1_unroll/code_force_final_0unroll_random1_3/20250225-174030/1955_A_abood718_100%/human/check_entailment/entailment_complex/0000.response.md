### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts in promotion).

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - **Condition 1**: If the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. In this case, the cost is `n * a`.
   - **Condition 2**: If `n` is even, then it's optimal to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion price. The cost in this case is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - **Condition 3**: If `n` is odd, then the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion price and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price. The cost in this case is `(n // 2) * b + a`.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not implement the first condition correctly. Instead of checking `if 2 * a < b`, it checks `if B * 2 < C`. This is likely a typo, and it should be `if 2 * A < C` to correctly compare the regular price of two yogurts with the promotion price.
   - The second and third conditions seem to be implemented correctly. If `n` is even, it calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b`. If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(n // 2) * b + a`.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program has a typo in the first condition. It should be `if 2 * A < C` instead of `if B * 2 < C`. As it stands, the program is not correct due to this typo.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
