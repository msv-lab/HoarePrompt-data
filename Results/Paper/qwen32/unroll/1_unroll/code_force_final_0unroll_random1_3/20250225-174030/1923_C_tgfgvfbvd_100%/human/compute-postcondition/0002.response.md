Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `c` of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `c` contains `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9. For each query, it accepts two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range within the list `c`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query.**
