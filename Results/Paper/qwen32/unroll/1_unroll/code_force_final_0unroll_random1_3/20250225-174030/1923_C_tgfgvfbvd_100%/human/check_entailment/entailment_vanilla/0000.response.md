Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray of the given array `c` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if:
1. There exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that the sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program uses prefix sums to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray. It also keeps track of the count of `1`s in the subarray using another prefix sum array.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - `p`: Stores the prefix sum of the array `c`.
   - `c`: Stores the prefix count of `1`s in the array `c`.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the sum (`s`) and the count of `1`s (`i`) in the subarray using the prefix sums.
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element, which is necessary for condition 2 (since we need at least two different elements).
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is used to determine if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array `b`. This condition essentially checks if there is enough "extra" sum (after subtracting the number of elements in the subarray) to make all elements in `b` different from `c` and still positive.

#### Reasoning Behind the Condition:
- `s` is the sum of the subarray.
- `(b - a + 1)` is the number of elements in the subarray.
- `s - (b - a + 1)` is the remaining sum after subtracting the number of elements. This remaining sum must be at least as large as the count of `1`s in the subarray (`i`) because each `1` in `c` must be increased to at least `2` in `b` to satisfy conditions 2 and 3. If there are other elements in the subarray, they can be adjusted accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the provided conditions. The use of prefix sums ensures that the program can handle the large input sizes efficiently.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
