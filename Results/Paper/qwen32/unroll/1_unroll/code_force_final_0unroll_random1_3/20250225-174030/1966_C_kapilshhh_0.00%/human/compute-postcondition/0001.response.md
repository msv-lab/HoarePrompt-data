The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which stands for the number of test cases. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `tc` is `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases and is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is guaranteed to be within this range, it is already greater than 0, and no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); the number of piles `n` and the number of stones in each pile `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case are still to be read.**
