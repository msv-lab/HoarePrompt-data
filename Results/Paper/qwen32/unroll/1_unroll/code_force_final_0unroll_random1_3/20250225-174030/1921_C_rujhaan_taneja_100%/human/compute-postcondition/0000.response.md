Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input by the user, such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `f`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9. `m` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `m_i` <= 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i + 1}`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `test_cases` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which represents the number of test cases to be processed. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m`) are still described as per the initial state since they have not been affected by the executed code.
