Output State: **The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all unique characters from the list `s` in reverse order of their first encounter in `s`.**

Explanation: The `unique_chars` list contains all unique characters from `s` in the order they were first encountered. The return statement reverses this order and joins the characters into a single string.
