Output State: **`s` is a list of strings, where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\). The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and \(10^4\). The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the list `s`. `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that the variables `i` and `j` have been initialized to 0 and the last index of `unique_chars`, respectively. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
