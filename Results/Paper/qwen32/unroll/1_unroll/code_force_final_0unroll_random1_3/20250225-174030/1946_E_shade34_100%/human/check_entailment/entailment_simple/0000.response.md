### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of counting permutations based on given prefix and suffix maximum indices. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `200001` modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is necessary for combinatorial calculations like binomial coefficients.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m1`, `m2`, the list of prefix maximum indices `p`, and the list of suffix maximum indices `s`.

3. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if the first prefix maximum index is `1`, the last suffix maximum index is `n`, and the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index. If any of these conditions fail, the program outputs `0` because such a permutation is impossible.

4. **Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.
   - It uses the function `func_2` to compute the modular inverse of a number, which is used in calculating binomial coefficients.

5. **Binomial Coefficients**:
   - The program calculates binomial coefficients using precomputed factorials. The function `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse of the denominator in the binomial coefficient formula.

6. **Prefix and Suffix Calculations**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix and prefix maximum indices to compute the number of valid permutations.
   - It uses the binomial coefficient to count the ways to arrange elements between the given indices.

7. **Final Output**:
   - After all calculations, the program prints the result for each test case.

### Function Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and also finds coefficients `c` and `d` such that `a*c + b*d = GCD(a, b)`.
  - This is used to compute modular inverses.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function computes the modular inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` using `func_1` and then multiplies it by `a` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Conclusion:

The program logically follows the problem requirements and correctly implements the necessary combinatorial calculations. It handles edge cases and ensures that the final result is computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Correctness: **True**
