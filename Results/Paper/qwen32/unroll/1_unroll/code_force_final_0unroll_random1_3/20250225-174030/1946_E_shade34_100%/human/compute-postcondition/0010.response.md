To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables. The code snippet calls a function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`, and assigns the return values to `c` and `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.

The function `func_1` is not defined in the snippet, so we will assume it returns two values based on its parameters. For the sake of this task, let's assume `func_1(x, y)` returns `(y, x)` as an example (since the actual function is not provided, this is a reasonable assumption to proceed with the task).

Thus, `c` will be assigned the value of `a % b` and `d` will be assigned the value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` is `a % b`, `d` is `b`.**

This output state includes all the preconditions that are still valid after the code has been executed, with the updated values of `c` and `d`.
