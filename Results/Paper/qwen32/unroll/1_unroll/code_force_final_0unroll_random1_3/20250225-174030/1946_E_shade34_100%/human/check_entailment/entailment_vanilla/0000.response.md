To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the problem and the provided functions in detail. The problem requires us to find the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximum indices.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Prefix Maximums**: These are indices in the permutation where the element at that index is greater than all elements before it.
2. **Suffix Maximums**: These are indices in the permutation where the element at that index is greater than all elements after it.
3. **Output**: We need to output the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Functions Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and also finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - The return value `(c, d)` corresponds to the coefficients `x` and `y`.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` and then multiplies it by `a`, taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - The modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` is a number `x` such that `b * x â‰¡ 1 (mod 10^9 + 7)`.

### Correctness of the Program

The provided code does not directly solve the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, it includes functions that are typically used for modular arithmetic operations, such as computing the modular multiplicative inverse.

To solve the problem correctly, we would need to:
- Use combinatorial techniques to count the number of valid permutations.
- Ensure that the prefix and suffix maximum conditions are satisfied.
- Use the modular arithmetic functions to handle large numbers and ensure results are modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The given code does not include any logic to handle the prefix and suffix maximum conditions or to count permutations. Therefore, the provided code is not correct for solving the given problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
