### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires counting permutations based on specific prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic and careful handling of constraints. The given code, however, only includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that appear to be related to modular arithmetic, specifically for computing modular inverses. These functions do not address the core logic needed for solving the problem.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting permutations of length `n` such that the given indices are prefix and suffix maximums.
   - This involves combinatorial counting and careful handling of constraints.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function appears to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is a common utility in modular arithmetic but does not directly solve the problem of counting permutations.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function computes `(a * modular_inverse(b, 1000000007)) % 1000000007`. This is also a utility function for modular arithmetic but does not address the problem of counting permutations.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The code does not include any logic for generating or counting permutations.
   - It does not check if a permutation meets the criteria for having the specified prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It does not count and return the number of valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
