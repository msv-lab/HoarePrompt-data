The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The current state already satisfies this condition since `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is an empty list**
