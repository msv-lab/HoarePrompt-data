Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the required remainders of the product of the array elements as per the problem description. The main issue lies in the way the program handles the product of the array elements. The program incorrectly appends elements to the list `b` based on the commands and then calculates the product in reverse order, which does not reflect the correct sequence of array states as commands are processed.

Here's a brief explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Array State Representation**: The program is supposed to calculate the product of the current state of the array `a` and output the remainder when divided by `m` before removing an element based on the command. However, it incorrectly appends elements to `b` based on the commands and then calculates the product in reverse order, which does not match the sequence of operations described in the problem.

2. **Inefficient Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which does not reflect the correct state of the array `a` after each command. It should calculate the product of the current state of `a` and then remove an element based on the command.

To fix this, the program should maintain the product of the current array state and update it as elements are removed based on the commands. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements in the array modulo m
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    result = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        result.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[left], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            left += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[right], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            right -= 1
    
    print(*result)
```

In the corrected version, the product of the array elements is maintained and updated as elements are removed based on the commands. The `pow(a[i], m - 2, m)` is used to compute the modular multiplicative inverse, which effectively removes an element from the product modulo `m`.
