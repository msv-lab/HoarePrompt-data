Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to move chips to form a contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. Each operation consists of moving a chip to the nearest free cell to its left.

### Key Observations

1. **Identify the leftmost and rightmost chips**: The minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block is determined by the distance between the leftmost and rightmost chips and the free cells in between.
2. **Count the free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips**: The number of operations needed is equal to the number of free cells (`0`s) between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program to see if it aligns with the above observations.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of the ribbon as a string of `0`s and `1`s.

2. **Finding the Leftmost and Rightmost Chips**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first `1` (leftmost chip).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first `1` from the end (rightmost chip). Since the string is reversed, we need to adjust this index to the original string by using `n - y - 1`.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between the Chips**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This slice is supposed to capture the substring from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip. However, `n - y` is incorrect here because `y` is already adjusted for the reversed string. The correct slice should be `arr[x:n - y - 1]` or simply `arr[x:n - y]` if we consider the reversed string's index directly.
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the substring, which is the minimum number of operations required.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Slice Calculation**: The slice `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. The correct slice should be `arr[x:n - y - 1]` to account for the reversed index adjustment, or the program should directly use the reversed index without adjusting it.
- **No Adjustment for Reversed Index**: The program does not correctly adjust the reversed index `y` to the original string's index.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y - 1]  # Corrected slice
        print(z.count('0'))

# or alternatively

def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = n - arr[::-1].find('1') - 1  # Correctly adjusted reversed index
        z = arr[x:y + 1]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the slice to count the free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Correctness: **False**
