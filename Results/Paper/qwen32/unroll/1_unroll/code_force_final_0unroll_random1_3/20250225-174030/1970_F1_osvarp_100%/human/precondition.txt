N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99. The field is a 2D list of strings with dimensions N x M, where each string is either "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", or ".Q". There is at least one "RG" and one "BG" in the field. There is exactly one ".Q" in the field. T is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. Each action in the list of T actions is a valid action as described in the problem statement.
