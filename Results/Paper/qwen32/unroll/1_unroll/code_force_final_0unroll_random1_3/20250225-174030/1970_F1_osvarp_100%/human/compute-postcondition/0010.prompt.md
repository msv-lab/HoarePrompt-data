Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, representing the dimensions of the field; `grid` is a list of lists representing the parsed input lines; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including any players and goals; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle, initialized to `False` for each player; `goal` is a list of lists where `goal[0]` contains the positions of blue team goals and `goal[1]` contains the positions of red team goals, categorized based on the input; `points` is `[0, 0]`; `t` is an integer read from the input representing the number of steps in the game; `command` is a list of strings representing a command where the first element is the entity performing the action, the second element is the action, and if the action is 'C', the third element is the ball being caught.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
