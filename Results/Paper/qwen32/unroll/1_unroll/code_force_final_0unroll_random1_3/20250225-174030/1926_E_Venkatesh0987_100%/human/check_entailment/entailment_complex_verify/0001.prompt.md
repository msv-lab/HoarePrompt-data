You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: The output is a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of the computation for each test case. The exact values depend on the input values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is greater than half of `n` plus one, it performs a series of calculations involving halving and powers of two to determine the output. Otherwise, it directly computes `2 * k - 1`. The output is a series of integers, each corresponding to a test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to understand its logic and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Odd Numbers (First Group):** Vladislav lays down all odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
2. **Multiples of Odd Numbers:** Next, he lays down multiples of odd numbers in ascending order (2 * odd, 3 * odd, 4 * odd, etc.).

### Key Observations
- **Odd Numbers:** The first (n + 1) // 2 cards are odd numbers.
- **Multiples of Odd Numbers:** For each subsequent group of multiples, the number of cards is halved each time (since we're only taking multiples of odd numbers that haven't been used yet).

### Program Analysis
Let's walk through the program to see if it correctly implements the above logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (position of the card to find).

2. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   s = 0
   i = 0
   d = n
   h = n
   p = 1
   g = 0
   ```
   - `s` is used to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - `i` represents the current group number (starting from 0).
   - `d` and `h` are used to keep track of the remaining cards in the current group.
   - `p` is a counter for the groups.
   - `g` is used to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down in previous groups.

3. **Handling k > (n + 1) // 2:**
   ```python
   if k > (n + 1) // 2:
       while s < k and d > 0:
           s += (d + 1) // 2
           d -= (d + 1) // 2
           i += 1
       while p <= i - 1:
           g += (h + 1) // 2
           h -= (h + 1) // 2
           p += 1
       f = k - g
       y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
       print(y)
   ```
   - If `k` is greater than the number of odd numbers, the program calculates which group `k` falls into and computes the `k`-th card in that group.
   - `s` accumulates the count of cards laid down until it reaches or exceeds `k`.
   - `i` keeps track of the group number.
   - `d` and `h` are used to calculate the number of cards left in each group.
   - `g` accumulates the count of cards in previous groups.
   - `f` is the position of the card within the current group.
   - `y` is the `k`-th card, calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

4. **Handling k <= (n + 1) // 2:**
   ```python
   else:
       print(2 * k - 1)
   ```
   - If `k` is within the range of odd numbers, the program directly computes the `k`-th card as `2 * k - 1`.

### Correctness Verification
- The program correctly identifies the group for `k` and computes the `k`-th card based on the group.
- It handles the case where `k` is within the range of odd numbers by directly computing the card.
- The logic for handling `k` in subsequent groups is correct, as it calculates the position within the group and computes the card based on the group number.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
