Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The program is attempting to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue, but it does so in a way that does not consider all possible optimal paths. Specifically, the program does not keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position in the queue, which is necessary to find the overall minimum cost to reach any of the first `m` positions.

Here are some key issues with the program:
1. It does not maintain a dynamic programming or greedy approach to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.
2. The logic for deciding whether to add `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost is flawed and does not consider all scenarios.
3. The `best` variable is not updated correctly and does not reflect the minimum cost to reach any of the first `m` positions.

To correctly solve this problem, one would typically use a priority queue or a dynamic programming approach to efficiently find the minimum cost path for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
