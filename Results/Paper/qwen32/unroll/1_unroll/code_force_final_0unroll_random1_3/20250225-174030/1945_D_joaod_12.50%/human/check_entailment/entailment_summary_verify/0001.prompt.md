You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to reach a final position from a starting position, given two lists of costs associated with two different actions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people. He can bribe people to swap positions, paying `a_i` to swap with person `i` and `b_k` for each person `k` he passes through during the swap. The goal is to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve his goal.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Index Adjustments**: The code adjusts `n` and `m` by subtracting 1 to make them zero-based indices.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The code iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, calculating the total cost of bribes needed to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.
4. **Best Cost Tracking**: The code keeps track of the best (minimum) cost encountered that allows Kirill to be within the first `m` positions.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Loop and Conditionals**: The code iterates from the last person in the queue (`na_frente`) to the first (`-1`). For each person, it checks if the current position `v` is within the first `m` positions.
2. **Cost Updates**: 
   - If `v` is within the first `m` positions, it updates the `best` cost if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with person `v` (`total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current `best`.
   - It then adds the cost of either swapping with person `v` or passing through person `v` to the total cost, depending on which is cheaper.
3. **Output**: After processing all people, the code prints the best cost found.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Logic Error**: The current logic does not correctly account for the cost of passing through people when Kirill is not within the first `m` positions. Specifically, the code adds the cost of passing through people to the total cost even if it does not help Kirill reach one of the first `m` positions.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The code incorrectly adds the cost of passing through people to the total cost when it should only add the cost of swapping with the person if it helps Kirill reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the code does not correctly determine the minimum number of coins Kirill will have to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
