Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they satisfy the conditions 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k` is 1, `ans` is `[2, 3]` followed by `2`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from `2^(lk)` to `2^(l-1)`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.**
