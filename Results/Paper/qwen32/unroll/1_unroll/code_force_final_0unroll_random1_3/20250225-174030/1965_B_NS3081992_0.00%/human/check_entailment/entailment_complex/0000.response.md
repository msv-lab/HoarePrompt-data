### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic and output of the function `func_14()`, which is responsible for generating the sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements. The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it outputs the size of the sequence and the sequence itself.

Let's break down the logic of `func_14()`:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `n` and `k` are read from the input.
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n`.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.

2. **Case when `k == 1`**:
   - If `n == 2`, the function returns the sequence `[1, 2]`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`.

3. **Case when `k != 1`**:
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k`.
   - `lk` is the length of `bk`.
   - The function constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
   - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from `2^(lk)` to `2^(l-1)`.

### Verification Against the Problem Statement:

- **Condition 1: No subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`**:
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3]` (or `[1, 2]` when `n == 2`) does not contain any subsequence that sums to `1`.
  - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed such that no combination of elements sums to `k`. This is ensured by the specific values added to the sequence (`k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`), which prevent any subsequence from summing to `k`.

- **Condition 2: For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`**:
  - The sequence includes powers of 2, which can form any sum up to `2^(l-1) - 1` (inclusive) by combining different elements.
  - The additional elements (`k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`) ensure that all sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by combining the elements appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_14()` correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. The program reads the input, processes each test case using `func_14()`, and outputs the results.

### Your response:

Reasoning: The function `func_14()` correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. The program reads the input, processes each test case using `func_14()`, and outputs the results.
