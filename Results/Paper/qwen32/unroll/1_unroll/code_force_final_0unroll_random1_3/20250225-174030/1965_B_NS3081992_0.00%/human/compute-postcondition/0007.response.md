The code snippet provided initializes a list `ans` with the values `[2, 3]`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they satisfy the conditions 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `k` is 1; `n` is not equal to 2; `ans` is [2, 3]**.
