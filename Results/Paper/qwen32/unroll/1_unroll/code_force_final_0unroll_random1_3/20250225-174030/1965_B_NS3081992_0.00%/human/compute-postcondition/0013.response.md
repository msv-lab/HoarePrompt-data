The code snippet calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k` and assigns it to `lk`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they satisfy the conditions 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`; `k` is not equal to 1; `ans` is an empty list.**
