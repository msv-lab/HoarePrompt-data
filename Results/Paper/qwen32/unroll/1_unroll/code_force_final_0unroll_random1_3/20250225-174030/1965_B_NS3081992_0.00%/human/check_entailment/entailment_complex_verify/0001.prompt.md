You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of several functions, but the core logic lies in `func_14()` which generates the sequence for a given `n` and `k`. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

#### Handling `k == 1`
- If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`.
- Otherwise, for `k == 1`, the sequence is `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Handling `k > 1`
- For `k > 1`, the sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
- It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
- It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
- Finally, it adds powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Verification of Conditions
1. **No subsequence sums to `k`**:
   - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that no combination of the initial powers of 2 can sum up to `k` because it fills the gap between the sum of the initial powers of 2 and `k - 1`.
   - The terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are chosen to be outside the range that could sum to `k`.

2. **Subsequences sum to all `v` where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`**:
   - The initial powers of 2 allow for all sums up to `2^l - 1` where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` fills in any gaps up to `k - 1`.
   - The remaining powers of 2 allow for sums up to `n`.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for all given test cases. The logic ensures that there is no subsequence that sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n`.

### Response
Reasoning: The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements by ensuring no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible.
Correctness: **True**
