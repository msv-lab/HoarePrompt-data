Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`**.

This means that `n` and `k` retain their values as returned by `func_4()`, with the additional information that `n` is not equal to 0. The variable `l` is now assigned the value that `func_1(n, k)` returns.
