Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length composed of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if there exists a specific pattern of '<' characters that violates a certain condition. If such a pattern is found, it outputs 'No' for that test case; otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without altering the input variables beyond the last test case processed.**
