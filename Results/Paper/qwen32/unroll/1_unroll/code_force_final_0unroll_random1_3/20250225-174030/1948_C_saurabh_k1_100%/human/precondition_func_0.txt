The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) where n is even, followed by two strings each of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
