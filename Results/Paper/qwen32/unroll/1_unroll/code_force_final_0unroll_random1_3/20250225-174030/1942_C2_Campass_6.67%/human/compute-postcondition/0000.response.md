The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is not executed in the snippet, so no variables are directly assigned or modified. The variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.**
