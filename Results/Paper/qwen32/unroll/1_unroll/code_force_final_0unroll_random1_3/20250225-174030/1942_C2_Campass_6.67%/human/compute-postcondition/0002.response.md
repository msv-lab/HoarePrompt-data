For the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. This loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero integer. Since `t` is described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it is guaranteed that `t` is non-zero and the loop can certainly execute one time.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.**
