You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it processes two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters. It determines if there is at least one position in both strings where the characters are the same ('<' or '>'). If such a position exists, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No". The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem involves a robot on a 2xN grid where the robot can move according to specific rules:
1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. Every second, the robot performs two moves:
   - First, it can move left, right, up, or down, but it can't move outside the grid.
   - Then, it must follow the arrow in the cell it ends up in.

The robot's goal is to reach cell (2, N). The arrows in the grid dictate the robot's movement in the second step of each second.

### Key Observations:
- The robot starts in the first row.
- To reach the second row, the robot must move down at some point.
- Once the robot moves down, it can only move right or follow the arrows.
- If the robot is in the second row, it must be able to move right towards (2, N).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution checks the following conditions:
1. For every pair of columns (2*i, 2*i+1) in the first row, if the arrow in column 2*i+1 points left (`<`), it checks if the arrows in columns 2*i and 2*i+2 in the second row both point left (`<`). If so, it returns 'No'.
2. It also checks if the arrow in the last column of the first row points left (`<`) and the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row points left (`<`). If so, it returns 'No'.

### Flaws in the Provided Solution:
- The solution does not consider all possible scenarios for the robot's movement.
- It specifically checks for a very narrow set of conditions that might not cover all cases where the robot could get stuck.
- For example, it does not account for scenarios where the robot could move up and down multiple times or where the arrows in the second row could be arranged in a way that prevents the robot from reaching (2, N) even if the conditions in the provided solution are not met.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not cover all possible scenarios and might incorrectly return 'No' for cases where the robot can actually reach (2, N). Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
