Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it processes two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters. It determines if there is at least one position in both strings where the characters are the same ('<' or '>'). If such a position exists, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No". The results for all test cases are printed, each on a new line.**
