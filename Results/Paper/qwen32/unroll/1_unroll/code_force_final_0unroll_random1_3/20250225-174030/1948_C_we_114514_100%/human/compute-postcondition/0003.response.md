To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable that can be adjusted here is `t`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The variables `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `results` are not directly part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n`, `row1`, `row2`, `results`) do not need adjustment based on the loop head.

### State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**.
