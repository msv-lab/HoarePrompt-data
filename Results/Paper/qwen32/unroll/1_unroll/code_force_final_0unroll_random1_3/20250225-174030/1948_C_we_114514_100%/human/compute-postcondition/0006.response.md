Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `row1` and `row2`, which are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters, and an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a value based on the comparison of corresponding characters in `row1` and `row2`. If there exists at least one position where both characters are '<' or both are '>', the function returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".**
