Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem involves a robot on a 2xN grid where the robot can move according to specific rules:
1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. Every second, the robot performs two moves:
   - First, it can move left, right, up, or down, but it can't move outside the grid.
   - Then, it must follow the arrow in the cell it ends up in.

The robot's goal is to reach cell (2, N). The arrows in the grid dictate the robot's movement in the second step of each second.

### Key Observations:
- The robot starts in the first row.
- To reach the second row, the robot must move down at some point.
- Once the robot moves down, it can only move right or follow the arrows.
- If the robot is in the second row, it must be able to move right towards (2, N).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution checks the following conditions:
1. For every pair of columns (2*i, 2*i+1) in the first row, if the arrow in column 2*i+1 points left (`<`), it checks if the arrows in columns 2*i and 2*i+2 in the second row both point left (`<`). If so, it returns 'No'.
2. It also checks if the arrow in the last column of the first row points left (`<`) and the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row points left (`<`). If so, it returns 'No'.

### Flaws in the Provided Solution:
- The solution does not consider all possible scenarios for the robot's movement.
- It specifically checks for a very narrow set of conditions that might not cover all cases where the robot could get stuck.
- For example, it does not account for scenarios where the robot could move up and down multiple times or where the arrows in the second row could be arranged in a way that prevents the robot from reaching (2, N) even if the conditions in the provided solution are not met.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not cover all possible scenarios and might incorrectly return 'No' for cases where the robot can actually reach (2, N). Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
