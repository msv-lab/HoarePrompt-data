The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `balance_info`. This action does not affect the existing variables `s` and `n`. Therefore, the string `s` remains a balanced parentheses sequence, and `n` retains its value as the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list.**
