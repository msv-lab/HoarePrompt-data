The code sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance at the start of each character's position in `s` in ascending order. If two elements have the same balance, they are sorted by their position in descending order. This means that for the same balance, the character that appears later in the string will come first in the sorted list.

Since the sorting operation does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `balance`, these remain unchanged. The only change is in the order of the `balance_info` list.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for elements with the same balance; `balance` is 0.**
