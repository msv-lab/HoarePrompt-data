Let's systematically evaluate the given program based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Balance Calculation**: For each character in the input string, compute the balance of the prefix before that character.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, sort them in decreasing order of their positions.
3. **Result Construction**: Construct the final string from the sorted list of characters.

### Provided Program Breakdown:
1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance for each prefix by iterating through the string and updating the balance based on whether the current character is '(' or ')'.
2. **Sorting**: The program uses a lambda function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)` to sort the characters. This lambda function sorts primarily by the balance and secondarily by the negative position (to achieve the decreasing order of positions when balances are the same).
3. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the final string by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Class Definition:
The program references a class `BalanceInfo` which is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the usage, it is assumed that `BalanceInfo` is a class with attributes `balance`, `position`, and `character`.

### Verification:
- The balance calculation is correct.
- The sorting criteria match the problem description.
- The result construction is correct.

### Function Summary Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function is defined but not used in the provided code. It seems to be intended for sorting purposes, but the lambda function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)` is used instead.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly calculates the balance for each character, sorts the characters based on the balance and position, and constructs the final string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the steps described in the problem. The sorting criteria match the problem description, and the result construction is correct. The fact that `func_1` is defined but not used does not affect the correctness of the program as long as the sorting is correctly handled by the lambda function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
