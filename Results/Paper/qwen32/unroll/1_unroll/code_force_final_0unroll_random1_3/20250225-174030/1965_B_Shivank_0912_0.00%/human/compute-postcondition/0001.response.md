The code snippet creates a list named `sequence` that contains 25 elements, where each element is a power of 2, specifically \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 24. The other variables `t`, `cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each element in `cases` is a tuple (n, k) where n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. `results` is an empty list. `sequence` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216].**
