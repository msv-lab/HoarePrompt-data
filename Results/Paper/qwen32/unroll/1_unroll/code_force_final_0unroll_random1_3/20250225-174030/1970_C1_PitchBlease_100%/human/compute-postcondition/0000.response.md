Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, both within the range of 1 to n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`**

Natural Language: The variable `queue` has been initialized as a deque containing a single tuple, where the first element of the tuple is the starting node `start` and the second element is `0`. All other variables (`start`, `target`, `tree`) remain unchanged.
