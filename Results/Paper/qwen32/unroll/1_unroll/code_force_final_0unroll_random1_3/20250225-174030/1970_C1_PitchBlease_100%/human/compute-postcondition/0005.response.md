Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v with 1 <= u, v <= n, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed such that 1 <= start <= n, `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node by an edge, `leaves` is a list of nodes in `tree` that have exactly one connection, `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`, `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`.**

In this output state, the variable `dist2` has been added and is assigned the shortest distance from the `start` node to the second leaf node in the `leaves` list, `leaves[1]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
