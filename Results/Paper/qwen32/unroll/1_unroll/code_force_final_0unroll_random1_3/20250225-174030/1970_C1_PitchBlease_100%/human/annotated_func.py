#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v with 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v with 1 <= u, v <= n, and `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed such that 1 <= start <= n. `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node by an edge.`

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the shortest path from a starting node to two different leaf nodes in an undirected tree. It accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of nodes; `edges`, a list of edges connecting the nodes; and `start`, the starting node. The function returns 'Ron' if at least one of the shortest paths from the starting node to any two leaf nodes has an odd length, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
