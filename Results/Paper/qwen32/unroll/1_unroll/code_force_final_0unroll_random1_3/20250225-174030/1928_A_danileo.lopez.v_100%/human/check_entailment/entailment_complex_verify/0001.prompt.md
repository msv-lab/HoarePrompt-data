You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Input

Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

            if a % 2 == 0:

                if a1 != b:

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each being either "Yes" or "No", depending on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints "Yes" if either `a` or `b` can be split into two equal parts such that neither part equals the other integer, otherwise it prints "No". The function outputs `t` lines, each being either "Yes" or "No", depending on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and he wants to cut it into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he wants to form another rectangle using the two resulting rectangles. If the new rectangle has different dimensions (ignoring rotation), Bob can obtain another rectangle.

### Key Points:
1. If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size along the even dimension.
2. If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
3. If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
4. After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side or one on top of the other.
5. The new rectangle should have different dimensions compared to the original `a x b` rectangle. For example, if he cuts a `2 x 6` rectangle into two `2 x 3` rectangles, he can form a `4 x 3` rectangle, which is different from `2 x 6`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
4. If `a` is even, it calculates two `a/2 x b` rectangles and checks if `a/2` is not equal to `b`.
5. If `b` is even, it calculates two `a x b/2` rectangles and checks if `b/2` is not equal to `a`.
6. If either condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly. Specifically, if both `a` and `b` are even, the program will only check one of the conditions (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`) and print "Yes" if that condition is met, even if the resulting rectangle has the same dimensions as the original when rotated.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly. For example, a `4 x 4` rectangle can be cut into two `4 x 2` rectangles, and then these can be rearranged to form a `2 x 8` rectangle, which is different from `4 x 4`. However, the program will print "No" for a `4 x 4` rectangle because it only checks one of the even conditions.

### Corrected Logic:
The correct logic should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly.

Correctness: **False**
