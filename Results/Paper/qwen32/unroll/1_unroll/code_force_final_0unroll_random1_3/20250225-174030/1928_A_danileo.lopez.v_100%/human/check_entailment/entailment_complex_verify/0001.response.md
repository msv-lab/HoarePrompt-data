### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given program to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then wants to form another rectangle using the two resulting rectangles. The new rectangle should have different dimensions (ignoring rotation).

#### Key Points:
1. If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size along the even dimension.
2. If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
3. If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
4. After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side or one on top of the other.
5. The new rectangle should have different dimensions compared to the original `a x b` rectangle. For example, if he cuts a `2 x 6` rectangle into two `2 x 3` rectangles, he can form a `4 x 3` rectangle, which is different from `2 x 6`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
4. If `a` is even, it calculates two `a/2 x b` rectangles and checks if `a/2` is not equal to `b`.
5. If `b` is even, it calculates two `a x b/2` rectangles and checks if `b/2` is not equal to `a`.
6. If either condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Issues in the Program:
The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly. Specifically, if both `a` and `b` are even, the program will only check one of the conditions (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`) and print "Yes" if that condition is met, even if the resulting rectangle has the same dimensions as the original when rotated.

However, the original assessment suggests that the program is incorrect due to not handling the case where both `a` and `b` are even. Let's review this more closely. 

- If `a` is even, Bob can form a new rectangle by cutting it into two `a/2 x b` rectangles. The new dimensions would be `(a/2) x (2b)`, which is different from `a x b` unless `a/2` equals `b`.
- If `b` is even, Bob can form a new rectangle by cutting it into two `a x b/2` rectangles. The new dimensions would be `(2a) x (b/2)`, which is different from `a x b` unless `b/2` equals `a`.

The program correctly checks these conditions. If either `a` or `b` is even, and the resulting dimensions are different, it prints "Yes". If both `a` and `b` are odd, it correctly prints "No".

#### Correctness:
The program is correct because it correctly handles all cases:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, it checks if the resulting dimensions are different and prints "Yes" if they are.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it correctly prints "No".

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct.

Final: **True**
