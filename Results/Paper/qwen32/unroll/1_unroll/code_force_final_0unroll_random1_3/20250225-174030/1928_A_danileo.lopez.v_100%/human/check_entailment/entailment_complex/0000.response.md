### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key insight is that:

1. If either `a` or `b` is even, it can be split into two equal parts. 
2. If the resulting parts can form a new rectangle that is different from the original, the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it is "No".

The provided code checks if either `a` or `b` is even:
- If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal parts `a1` and `a2`, and checks if `a1` is not equal to `b`.
- If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal parts `b1` and `b2`, and checks if `b1` is not equal to `a`.
- If neither condition is met, it returns "No".

However, the code logic is flawed because it only checks one of the possible splits for `a` or `b` and does not consider all possible ways to form a new rectangle. Specifically:

- If `a` is even, splitting `a` into two equal parts `a1` and `a2` and checking if `a1 != b` is correct, but it should also consider the possibility of forming a new rectangle by using the split parts in different configurations.
- Similarly, if `b` is even, splitting `b` into two equal parts `b1` and `b2` and checking if `b1 != a` is correct, but it should also consider the possibility of forming a new rectangle by using the split parts in different configurations.

The correct approach should be:
- If `a` is even, check if `a/2` is not equal to `b` (which is already done).
- If `b` is even, check if `b/2` is not equal to `a` (which is already done).
- If both `a` and `b` are even, it should also check if `a/2` and `b/2` can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, it is always possible to form a new rectangle unless the resulting parts are the same as the original dimensions.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the current logic does not cover all cases correctly. For example, a `2 x 4` rectangle can be split into two `2 x 2` rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a `1 x 4` rectangle, which is different from the original.

### Correctness:
**False**
