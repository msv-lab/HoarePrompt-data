To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, two integers `a` and `b` are read.
3. The loop checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
   - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal parts (`a1` and `a2`). If `a1` (which is equal to `a2`) is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next iteration.
   - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal parts (`b1` and `b2`). If `b1` (which is equal to `b2`) is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next iteration.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "No".
4. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints "No".

Since the loop only prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions and does not modify any variables outside its scope, the only state that changes is the output itself. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each iteration, so they do not retain any state after the loop finishes.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each being either "Yes" or "No", depending on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after the loop finishes.**
