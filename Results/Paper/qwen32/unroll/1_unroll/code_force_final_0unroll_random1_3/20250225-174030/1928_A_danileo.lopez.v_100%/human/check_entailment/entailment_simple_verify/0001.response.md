### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he wants to form another rectangle using the two resulting rectangles. The new rectangle should have different dimensions compared to the original `a x b` rectangle, ignoring rotation.

### Key Points:
1. If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size along the even dimension.
2. If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
3. If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
4. After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side or one on top of the other.
5. The new rectangle should have different dimensions compared to the original `a x b` rectangle. For example, if he cuts a `2 x 6` rectangle into two `2 x 3` rectangles, he can form a `4 x 3` rectangle, which is different from `2 x 6`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
4. If `a` is even, it calculates two `a/2 x b` rectangles and checks if `a/2` is not equal to `b`.
5. If `b` is even, it calculates two `a x b/2` rectangles and checks if `b/2` is not equal to `a`.
6. If either condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the program: it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly. Specifically, if both `a` and `b` are even, the program will only check one of the conditions (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`) and print "Yes" if that condition is met, even if the resulting rectangle has the same dimensions as the original when rotated.

However, the original assessment also suggests that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly. But let's re-evaluate this:

- If both `a` and `b` are even, the program will still correctly identify that at least one of the dimensions is even and proceed to check if the resulting rectangle has different dimensions.
- Specifically, if `a` is even, it will check if `a/2 != b`. If `b` is even, it will check if `b/2 != a`. If either of these conditions is true, it will print "Yes".

### Correctness:
The program is actually correct because:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, it can always form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly. However, the program does handle this case correctly by checking if either `a/2 != b` or `b/2 != a`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct.

Final: **True**
