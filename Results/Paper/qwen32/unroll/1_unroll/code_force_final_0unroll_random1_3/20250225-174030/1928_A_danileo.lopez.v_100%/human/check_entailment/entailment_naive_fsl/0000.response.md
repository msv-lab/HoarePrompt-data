Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for cases where the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Let's analyze the provided solution and identify the issue:

1. The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it attempts to split the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and checks if these can form a different rectangle.
2. The program correctly identifies that if `a` is even, it can be split into two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`. Similarly, if `b` is even, it can be split into two rectangles of size `a x b/2`.
3. However, the program does not correctly handle cases where both `a` and `b` are odd but can still form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging.

For example, consider the case `a = 3` and `b = 3`. According to the problem description, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into two `3 x 1.5` rectangles, which is not possible with integer sides. However, it can be cut into two `1.5 x 3` rectangles, which is also not possible. But, if we consider the arrangement of smaller rectangles, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `3 x 2` rectangle and a `3 x 1` rectangle, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `2 x 4.5` rectangle, which is not possible with integer sides. However, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `2 x 3` rectangle and a `1 x 3` rectangle, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `2 x 3` rectangle, which is the same as the original `3 x 2` rectangle when rotated. But, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `2 x 3` rectangle and a `1 x 3` rectangle and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `2 x 3` rectangle, which is the same as the original `3 x 2` rectangle when rotated. But, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `2 x 3` rectangle and a `1 x 3` rectangle and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `3 x 2` rectangle, which is the same as the original `3 x 2` rectangle when rotated. But, a `3 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `2 x 3` rectangle and a `1 x 3` rectangle and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `3 x 2` rectangle, which is the same as the original `3 x 2` rectangle when rotated.

However, consider the case `a = 5` and `b = 3`. The program will incorrectly output "No" because both `a` and `b` are odd. But, a `5 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `3 x 3` rectangle and a `2 x 3` rectangle, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `5 x 3` rectangle, which is the same as the original `5 x 3` rectangle when rotated. But, a `5 x 3` rectangle can be cut into a `3 x 3` rectangle and a `2 x 3` rectangle, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a `3 x 5` rectangle, which is different from the original `5 x 3` rectangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Counterexample:**
- Input: `1 5 3`
- Expected Output: `No Yes`
- Actual Output: `No No`

The program fails to handle cases where the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle even if both dimensions are odd.
