The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `vis` as an empty set. This does not affect the existing variables `arr`, `nums`, and `start`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
