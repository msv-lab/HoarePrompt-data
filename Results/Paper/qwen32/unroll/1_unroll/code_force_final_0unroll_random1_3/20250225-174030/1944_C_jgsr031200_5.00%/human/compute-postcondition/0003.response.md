To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `nums.get(start, 0)`. This condition checks if the count of the integer `start` in the `Counter` object `nums` is greater than 0.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is an empty set.

The loop condition `nums.get(start, 0)` will be true if the count of `start` (which is 0) in `nums` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `nums` must have a count of at least 1 for the integer 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition**:
   - The only variable in the loop condition is `start`, which is currently 0.
   - The `Counter` object `nums` is also relevant because it provides the count of `start`.

2. **Determine the Necessary Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `nums.get(start, 0)` is greater than 0.
   - Since `start` is 0, `nums.get(0, 0)` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - To ensure `nums.get(0, 0)` is greater than 0, the `Counter` object `nums` must have a count of at least 1 for the integer 0.
   - This means that the list `arr` must contain at least one occurrence of the integer 0.

### Conclusion:
To make sure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, the list `arr` must contain at least one occurrence of the integer 0. This will ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `arr` contains at least one 0; `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr` and has a count of at least 1 for the integer 0; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**
