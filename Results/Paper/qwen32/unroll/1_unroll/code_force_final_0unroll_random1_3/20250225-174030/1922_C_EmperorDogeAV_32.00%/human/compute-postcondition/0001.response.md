The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop iterates over the range `(n - 1)`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n - 1` must be at least 1 for the loop to run).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 2, and `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts. The state of `cities` and `prog_cities` does not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i) representing the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 0**
