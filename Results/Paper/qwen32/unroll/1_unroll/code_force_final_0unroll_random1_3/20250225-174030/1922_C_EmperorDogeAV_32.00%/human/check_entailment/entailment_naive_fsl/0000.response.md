Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` and how the prefix sums are calculated do not correctly determine the minimum cost to travel between cities using the closest city strategy.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine the cost to move to the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly calculates the cost for moving to the closest city. It should return the cost of moving to the closest city, which is always 1 coin, instead of the distance to the closest city.
   - The current implementation calculates the distance to the closest city, but it should always return 1 if the closest city is chosen.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect values returned by `func_1`. Since `func_1` does not return 1 for the closest city, the prefix sums will not correctly represent the cumulative cost to move to the closest city repeatedly.

### Correct Approach:

- For each city, determine the closest city and the cost to move to it (which is always 1).
- Calculate the prefix sums based on the cost to move to the closest city repeatedly.
- For each query, determine the minimum cost to travel from city `x` to city `y` using the closest city strategy or direct travel.

### Example of Failure:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The program will incorrectly calculate the prefix sums based on the distances to the closest cities instead of the cost of 1 coin to move to the closest city. This will lead to incorrect results for the queries.

### Corrected Code Snippet:
Here is a snippet of how `func_1` and the prefix sum calculation should be corrected:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [1] * (n - 1)  # Always 1 coin to move to the closest city
    return prog_cities

# Rest of the code remains the same
```

With this correction, the program should correctly handle the problem as described. However, the original code does not meet the requirements, hence the correctness is **False**.
