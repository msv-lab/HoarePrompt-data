Precondition: **cities is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i) representing the queries. n is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of cities, and m is an integer (1 <= m <= 10^5) representing the number of queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.**
