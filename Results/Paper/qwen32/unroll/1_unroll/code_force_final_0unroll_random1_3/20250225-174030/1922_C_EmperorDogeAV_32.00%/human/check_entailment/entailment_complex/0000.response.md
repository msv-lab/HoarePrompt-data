### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the minimum cost to travel between cities, where the cost can be either 1 coin to travel to the closest city or the actual distance in coins to travel directly to another city. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program correctly parses the input to get the number of cities, their coordinates, the number of queries, and the queries themselves.
2. **Closest City Calculation:** The function `func_1` calculates the closest city or the distance to the closest city for each city. This is done by comparing the distance to the previous and next city.
3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:** The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward closest city distances. This helps in efficiently calculating the cost to travel between any two cities using the closest city strategy.
4. **Query Processing:** For each query, the program determines the cost to travel from one city to another using the precomputed prefix sums.

However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

- **Function `func_1` Logic:** The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the closest city. It should determine the closest city based on the unique closest city condition provided in the problem statement. The current implementation only checks the immediate neighbors and assigns a value based on that, which is not sufficient to handle the unique closest city condition.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** The prefix sums are calculated correctly for the forward and backward directions, but the logic to determine the cost for each query is flawed due to the incorrect closest city calculation.
- **State Description:** The state description in the comments does not accurately reflect the expected behavior of the function `func_1`. The function should return a list indicating the closest city for each city, not the distance to the closest city.

### Correctness:

Given the issues with the `func_1` function and the incorrect state description, the program is not correctly implementing the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
