Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to select exactly half of the integer `k` (i.e., `k // 2`) unique integers from two lists, `a` and `b`, such that each integer from 1 to `k` is considered. If it can select exactly `k // 2` integers from each list without exceeding `k // 2` from either list, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.**
