arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of the array a for a test case, followed by the elements of the array a for that test case. The first element of arr is the number of test cases t, and the subsequent elements are the lengths and values of the arrays for each test case. The length of each array n is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and the elements of the arrays a_i are between 1 and 10^9. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
