#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a map object that is the result of applying the `int` function to each item in the input split by whitespace.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each item in the input split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and returns a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are derived from the input string, where the input string is split by spaces and each element is converted to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns these integers as a list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4`.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers derived from the input string, where the input string is expected to contain space-separated values that can be converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a space-separated string of values from the input, converts these values to integers, sorts them, and returns the sorted list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters. The function `func_5` is expected to read input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array `a`.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains string representations of the integers read from standard input, split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. The function returns a map object containing string representations of all integers read from standard input, split by whitespace.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_6` does not take any parameters, and it returns a list of characters. However, based on the context provided in the problem description, we can infer that the input to this function would typically be a string of digits (representing the array elements), which is then converted to a list of characters.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters where each character is an element from the input string of digits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads an input string of digits from the user and returns a list where each element is a character from the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_7` does not take any parameters and does not have any variables in its signature. Therefore, the precondition is that there are no specific variable constraints.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a word from the input, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` takes no input parameters and returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a word from the user's input, split by spaces.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list where each element at index `i` is the product of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` is the product of the first `i+1` elements of the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element at index `i` is the product of the first `i+1` elements of the input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and the function calculates the cumulative product of the elements in reverse order, storing the results in a new list ans.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: arr is a list of integers, ans is a list containing the cumulative products of arr in reverse order, tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list containing the cumulative products of `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing the cumulative products of the elements in the original list, calculated in reverse order.
