To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. For the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute if the range function produces at least one value, which depends on the length of `arr`.

### Analysis:
1. **`arr`**: The loop iterates over `arr` in reverse order. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the range will not produce any values, and the loop will not execute.
2. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be explicitly set because it is determined by the range function.

### Adjustments:
- Ensure `arr` has at least one element.
- `i` does not need to be set explicitly before the loop starts because it is initialized by the range function.

### State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1**
