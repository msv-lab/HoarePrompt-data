`t` is assigned the value `int(input(''))`, where `input` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9; `m` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
