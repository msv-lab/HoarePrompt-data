To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the given Python loop. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the input integer. In each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, constructs a list `L` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 (rounding up), and then calculates a specific value based on the position of `k` within the cumulative sums of the elements in `L`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: The loop initializes an empty list `L`.
2. **Constructing List `L`**:
   - It repeatedly divides `n` by 2, rounding up, and appends the result to `L`.
   - This process continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. **Calculating the Output**:
   - It initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It iterates through each element `a` in `L`.
   - If `tot < k <= tot + a`, it prints `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - It updates `tot` by adding `a` and `pow` by multiplying it by 2.

The output of the loop for each iteration is a printed value based on the conditions met during the inner loop. Since the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, and the output of each iteration is a printed value, the output state can be described as the sequence of printed values for each iteration.

Given that the loop prints a value for each iteration, the output state will contain the printed values for each of the `t` iterations.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` printed values, each calculated based on the input values `n` and `k` for that iteration.**
