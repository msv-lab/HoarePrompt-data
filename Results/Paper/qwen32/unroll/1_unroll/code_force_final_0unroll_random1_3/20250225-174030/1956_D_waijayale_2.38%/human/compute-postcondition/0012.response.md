Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the array `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `r` and not equal to `l`, and it remains the index of the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`.**
