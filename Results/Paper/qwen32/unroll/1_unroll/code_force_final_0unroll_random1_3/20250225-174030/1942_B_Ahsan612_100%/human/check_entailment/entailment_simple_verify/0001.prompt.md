You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a`, where:
- `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Given Program:
The program iterates over the array `a` from the end to the beginning, calculating the corresponding value in `p` using the formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, and updates the `mex` value accordingly.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `ar` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The key idea is to ensure that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res`.
   - By iterating from the end to the beginning, we are effectively constructing the permutation `p` in reverse order, which allows us to correctly determine the `mex` at each step.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res` after each step.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `ar[i]` is positive, zero, or negative.
   - The program also handles the case where `mex` is updated correctly when `mex - ar[i]` is smaller than the current `mex`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` by iterating from the end to the beginning and updating the `mex` value accordingly. The program adheres to the problem constraints and correctly calculates the required permutation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
