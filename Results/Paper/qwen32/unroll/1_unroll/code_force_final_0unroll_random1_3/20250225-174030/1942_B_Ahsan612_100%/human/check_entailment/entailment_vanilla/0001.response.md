Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a`, where:
- `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Given Program:
The program iterates over the array `a` from the end to the beginning, calculating the corresponding value in `p` using the formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, and updates the `mex` value accordingly.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `ar` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The key idea is to ensure that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res`.
   - By iterating from the end to the beginning, we are effectively constructing the permutation `p` in reverse order, which allows us to correctly determine the `mex` at each step.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res` after each step.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `ar[i]` is positive, zero, or negative.
   - The program also handles the case where `mex` is updated correctly when `mex - ar[i]` is smaller than the current `mex`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` by iterating from the end to the beginning and updating the `mex` value accordingly. The program adheres to the problem constraints and correctly calculates the required permutation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
