To understand the output state, let's break down the provided code and its functionality:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `ar` of length `n`.
2. **Result Array**: It initializes a result array `res` of length `n` with `None` values.
3. **Mex Calculation**: It sets `mex` (minimum excluded value) to `n`.
4. **Loop**: The code iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first). For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` if `mex - ar[i]` is smaller than the current `mex`.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the result array `res` as a space-separated string.

The key point here is that the loop processes each test case independently and modifies the result array `res` and `mex` for each test case. Since the loop iterates through all test cases, the final state of the variables `res` and `mex` will be specific to the last test case processed.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently and the state of variables is reset for each test case, the final output state will reflect the result of the last test case processed.

**Output State**: **After all iterations, the variables `res` and `mex` will reflect the result of the last test case processed. The specific values of `res` and `mex` will depend on the last test case's input values `n` and `ar`.**

However, since we need to provide a generic final state in the specified format, and the exact values depend on the last test case, we can describe the state in a general form:

Output State: **`res` is a list of integers derived from the last test case's input, and `mex` is the minimum excluded value after processing the last test case's input.**
