Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a`, where:
- `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Given Program:
The program iterates over the array `a` from the end to the beginning, calculating the corresponding value in `p` using the formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, and updates the `mex` value accordingly.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `ar` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The key idea is to ensure that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res`.
   - By iterating from the end to the beginning, we are effectively constructing the permutation `p` in reverse order, which allows us to correctly determine the `mex` at each step.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res` after each step.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Initialization of `mex`**: The `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is correct because initially, all integers from 0 to `n-1` are candidates for `mex`.
- **Updating `mex`**: The current update logic `mex = mex - ar[i]` is problematic. The `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res` after each assignment. Simply subtracting `ar[i]` from `mex` does not guarantee this.
- **Correct Update of `mex`**: The correct approach would be to maintain a set of used numbers and find the smallest non-negative integer not in this set after each assignment.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
- The program calculates `res` as `[0 1 4 2 3]` which is correct.
- However, the logic for updating `mex` is not robust and might fail for other inputs where `ar[i]` values are not simple.

### Correct Approach:
1. Use a set to keep track of used numbers.
2. Calculate `mex` as the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.
3. Assign `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
4. Add `res[i]` to the set of used numbers.
5. Update `mex` to the next smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

### Conclusion:
The provided program's logic for updating `mex` is flawed. While it may work for some test cases, it does not guarantee the correct `mex` value in all scenarios. The program needs to maintain a set of used numbers and correctly compute the `mex`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
