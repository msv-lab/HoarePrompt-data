Let's analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Recap:
We need to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

### Key Points:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value) of a list is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list.
2. **Reverse Construction**: The program constructs the permutation \( p \) by iterating from the end of the array \( a \) to the beginning.
3. **MEX Tracking**: The variable `mex` keeps track of the current MEX value.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `res` as a list of `None` values of length \( n \) and `mex` as \( n \).
2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates over the array \( a \) from the last element to the first.
3. **Permutation Calculation**: For each element \( a_i \) in the array, the corresponding element in the permutation \( p \) is calculated as \( p_i = \texttt{MEX} - a_i \). The `mex` is updated if the calculated \( p_i \) is smaller than the current `mex`.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program seems correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. However, there are a few points to consider:
- The program ensures that the calculated \( p_i \) is the correct value by using the current MEX and subtracting \( a_i \).
- The MEX is updated correctly whenever a smaller value is found, ensuring that the MEX reflects the minimum non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 -2 1 2`
   - Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
   - Calculation:
     - \( p_5 = 5 - 2 = 3 \)
     - \( p_4 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
     - \( p_3 = 3 - (-2) = 5 \) (but we use the current MEX which is 4)
     - \( p_2 = 4 - 1 = 3 \) (but we use the current MEX which is 2)
     - \( p_1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \) (but we use the current MEX which is 0)
   - The resulting permutation is `0 1 4 2 3`, which matches the expected output.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Output: `0 1 2 3 4`
   - Calculation:
     - \( p_5 = 5 - 1 = 4 \)
     - \( p_4 = 4 - 1 = 3 \)
     - \( p_3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
     - \( p_2 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( p_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - The resulting permutation is `0 1 2 3 4`, which matches the expected output.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `3`, `-2 1 2`
   - Output: `2 0 1`
   - Calculation:
     - \( p_3 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( p_2 = 2 - 1 = 1 \) (but we use the current MEX which is 0)
     - \( p_1 = 2 - (-2) = 4 \) (but we use the current MEX which is 2)
   - The resulting permutation is `2 0 1`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \) and the MEX calculations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) by iterating from the end of the array \( a \) to the beginning, calculating the MEX, and updating the permutation accordingly.
Correctness: **True**
