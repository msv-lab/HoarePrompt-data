The code snippet calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'. Therefore, the length `n` will be the total number of characters in the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of `s`.**
