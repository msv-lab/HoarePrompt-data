The code snippet provided initializes a variable `l` with the value `0`. This initialization does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **A is [0, 1, 3, 12]; idx_A is [0, 1, 2, 5]; B is [0, 1]; idx_B is [1, 0]; `l` is 0.**
