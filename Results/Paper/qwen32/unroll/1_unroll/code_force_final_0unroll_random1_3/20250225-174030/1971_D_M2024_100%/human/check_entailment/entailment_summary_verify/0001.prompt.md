You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`. For each binary string, it calculates and prints the number of segments required to split the string into contiguous blocks of identical characters, adding one to the count if there are no transitions from '1' to '0'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string can be cut into, so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorted Binary String**: A binary string is sorted if all '0's come before all '1's.
2. **Cutting Points**: The critical points where a cut is needed are transitions from '1' to '0'. This is because if there's a '1' before a '0', they need to be in separate pieces to be rearranged into a sorted string.
3. **Counting Cuts**: The number of cuts needed is equal to the number of transitions from '1' to '0'. This is because each such transition indicates a boundary where a new piece must start to ensure the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted string.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's or all '1's), no cuts are needed.
   - If the string has transitions from '1' to '0', the number of cuts is equal to the number of such transitions.
   - If there are transitions from '0' to '1', these do not require cuts because '0's can naturally come before '1's.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the above logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the binary string.
- It counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`).
- It counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0`), but this count is not actually used in the final output.
- If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it prints `cut1 + 1`. This is correct because if there are no '0's before any '1's, the string is already sorted, and no additional piece is needed beyond the cuts required.
- Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`, but this part of the logic is incorrect. The correct output should only depend on `cut1` because `cut0` does not affect the minimum number of pieces needed.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it uses `cut0` in the output, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct output should only be `cut1 + 1` for all cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program should be modified to only consider `cut1` and add 1 to it for the final output, regardless of the value of `cut0`.
