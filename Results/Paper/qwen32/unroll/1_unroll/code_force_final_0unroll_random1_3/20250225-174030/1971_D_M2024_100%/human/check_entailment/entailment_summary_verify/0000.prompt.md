You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`. For each binary string, it calculates and prints the number of segments required to split the string into contiguous blocks of identical characters, adding one to the count if there are no transitions from '1' to '0'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into, such that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).

The core logic of the program is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
2. It initializes two counters: `cut0` and `cut1`.
3. It iterates through the string and increments `cut1` whenever it detects a transition from '1' to '0', and `cut0` whenever it detects a transition from '0' to '1'.
4. If `cut0` is zero (meaning no transitions from '0' to '1' are found), it prints `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the logic against the provided examples and edge cases:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `11010`
   - Transitions: `1 -> 0` (cut1++), `0 -> 1` (cut0++), `1 -> 0` (cut1++)
   - `cut0 = 1`, `cut1 = 2`
   - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `00000000`
   - Transitions: None
   - `cut0 = 0`, `cut1 = 0`
   - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `1`
   - Transitions: None
   - `cut0 = 0`, `cut1 = 0`
   - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `10`
   - Transitions: `1 -> 0` (cut1++)
   - `cut0 = 0`, `cut1 = 1`
   - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `0001111`
   - Transitions: None
   - `cut0 = 0`, `cut1 = 0`
   - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `0110`
   - Transitions: `0 -> 1` (cut0++), `1 -> 0` (cut1++)
   - `cut0 = 1`, `cut1 = 1`
   - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

### Edge Case Consideration

- **Edge Case 1:**
  - Input: `101010`
  - Transitions: `1 -> 0` (cut1++), `0 -> 1` (cut0++), `1 -> 0` (cut1++), `0 -> 1` (cut0++)
  - `cut0 = 2`, `cut1 = 2`
  - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 2 + 2 = 4` (Correct)

- **Edge Case 2:**
  - Input: `111000`
  - Transitions: `1 -> 0` (cut1++), `0 -> 0` (no transition), `0 -> 0` (no transition)
  - `cut0 = 0`, `cut1 = 1`
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

- **Edge Case 3:**
  - Input: `001100`
  - Transitions: `0 -> 1` (cut0++), `1 -> 0` (cut1++), `0 -> 0` (no transition)
  - `cut0 = 1`, `cut1 = 1`
  - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases. It correctly counts the number of necessary cuts based on transitions between '0's and '1's, and it correctly handles cases where no cuts are needed.

### Final Answer
