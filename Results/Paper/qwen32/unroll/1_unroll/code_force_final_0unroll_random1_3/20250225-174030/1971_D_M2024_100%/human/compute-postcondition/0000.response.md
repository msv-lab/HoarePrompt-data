Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a binary string `s` such that 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500, where `s` consists only of the characters '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be the integer input by the user, which is still within the range of 1 to 500. The binary strings `s` for each test case remain unchanged and still satisfy the conditions provided in the initial state.
