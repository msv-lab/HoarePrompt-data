Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string must be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations

1. **Transition Points**: The key to solving this problem lies in identifying transition points from '1' to '0' and '0' to '1'. These transitions indicate where cuts are necessary to separate the string into segments that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

2. **Counting Cuts**:
   - If there is a transition from '1' to '0', we need to make a cut.
   - If there is a transition from '0' to '1', we need to make a cut.
   - However, after making the necessary cuts, we need to account for the fact that the first segment (starting with '0' or '1') doesn't require a preceding cut. Therefore, we add one to the total count of cuts.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no '0's or no '1's in the string, the string is already sorted, and no cuts are needed.
   - If the string starts with '1's and then transitions to '0's, the number of cuts is equal to the number of '1' to '0' transitions.
   - If the string starts with '0's and then transitions to '1's, the number of cuts is equal to the number of '0' to '1' transitions.
   - If there are both types of transitions, the total number of cuts is the sum of both types of transitions.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
```

1. **Counting Transitions**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of '1' to '0' transitions (`cut1`) and '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0`).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), the program adds 1 to the number of '1' to '0' transitions (`cut1 + 1`). This accounts for the fact that the first segment doesn't require a preceding cut.
   - If there are '0' to '1' transitions, the program simply adds the counts of both types of transitions (`cut0 + cut1`).

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct number of pieces required for each test case based on the transitions counted.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
