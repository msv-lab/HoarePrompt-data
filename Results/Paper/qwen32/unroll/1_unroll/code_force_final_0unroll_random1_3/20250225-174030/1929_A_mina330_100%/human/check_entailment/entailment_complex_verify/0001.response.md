### Reasoning

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis

The beauty of the array is defined as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

To maximize this value, we need to arrange the array such that the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then taking the difference between the last and the first element.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program follows the correct logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the array.
   - It reads the array elements.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array.

#### Annotations and Evaluation

The annotated version of the code provides a step-by-step description of the program's state:

1. `ntest = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
2. `for itest in range(0, ntest, 1)`: Iterates over each test case.
3. `n = int(input())`: Reads the length of the array for the current test case.
4. `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads the array elements for the current test case.
5. `a.sort()`: Sorts the array in ascending order.
6. `print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])`: Prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array.

The annotations confirm that the program correctly sorts the array and computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the beauty of the array.

#### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum beauty of the array for each test case by sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements.
