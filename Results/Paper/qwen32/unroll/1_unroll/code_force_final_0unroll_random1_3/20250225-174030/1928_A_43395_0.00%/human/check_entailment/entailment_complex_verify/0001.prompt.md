You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: t remains unchanged, a and b hold the values from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on the parity of `a` and `b`. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob can form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles if:
- He can cut the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- These two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

### Key Observations:
- If either dimension of the original rectangle is 1, then it cannot be cut into two distinct rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are even, then the rectangle can always be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, then the rectangle can also be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, then the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of size 1x(odd), which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic to Determine if a New Rectangle Can Be Formed:**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If they are, it prints "yes".
   - It then checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`. This condition is incorrect and doesn't make sense as it is comparing a tuple to a boolean value, and it doesn't implement the correct logic.
   - It then checks if `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`. This condition is always true if `a` and `b` are not equal, so it doesn't correctly determine the case where both dimensions are odd.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no".

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
- The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true if `a` and `b` are not equal, which is not the correct logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
- The program doesn't correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd.

### Correct Logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, print "no".
- If both `a` and `b` are not 1, print "yes".

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Correctness: **False**
