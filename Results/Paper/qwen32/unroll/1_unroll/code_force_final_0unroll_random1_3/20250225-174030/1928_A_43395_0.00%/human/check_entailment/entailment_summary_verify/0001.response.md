Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
Bob can form a new rectangle from a given rectangle of size `a x b` if he can cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original. Specifically:
- If either dimension is 1, it's impossible to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are even or one is even and the other is odd, it's possible to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, it's impossible to form a new rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program contains several logical errors:
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is incorrect and doesn't make sense as it compares a tuple to a boolean value. It seems to be an attempt to check if `a` equals `b`, but it's implemented incorrectly.
   
2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition is always true if `a` and `b` are not equal, which doesn't correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed. It doesn't account for the parity of `a` and `b`.

### Correct Logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, print "no".
- If both `a` and `b` are not 1, print "yes".

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Evaluation:
Given the issues in the original program and the correct logic derived from the problem description, the original program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment correctly identified the flaws in the program and provided a corrected version.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
