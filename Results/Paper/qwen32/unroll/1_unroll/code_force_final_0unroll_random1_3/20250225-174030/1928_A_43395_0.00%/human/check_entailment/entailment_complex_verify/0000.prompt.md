You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: t remains unchanged, a and b hold the values from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on the parity of `a` and `b`. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
3. It then checks the following conditions:
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints "yes".
   - If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, it prints "no".
   - If `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`, it prints "yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "no".

There are several issues with this logic:
1. The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is not meaningful. It seems like there's a logical error in this part of the code.
2. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true for any non-zero `a - b`. This condition does not correctly determine whether a new rectangle can be formed.
3. The program does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if `a` is even and `b` is odd (or vice versa), the program might not give the correct answer.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to show that the program is incorrect.

**Input:**
```
2
2 3
3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
Yes
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will print "no" for both cases because it does not handle the cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from those two smaller rectangles. This is possible if either `a` or `b` is even. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then it's not possible to form a new rectangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which is the correct condition for forming a new rectangle.
