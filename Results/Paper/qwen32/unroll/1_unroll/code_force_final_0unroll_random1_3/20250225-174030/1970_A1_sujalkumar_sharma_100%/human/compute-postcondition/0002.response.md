The code snippet initializes a variable `balance` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `prefix_balance`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is an empty list; `balance` is 0.**
