### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and its execution summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

**Objective:**
Given an array `a` of length `n`, we need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a_i = mex(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `mex` refers to the minimum non-negative integer not present in the given list.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `mex` as an empty list to store the resulting permutation.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - `used` is a dictionary to keep track of which integers have been used in the permutation.

2. **Processing Each Element:**
   - For each element in the array `arr`, the program checks if the element is positive.
   - If the element is positive, it appends the current `minn` value to `mex` and marks `minn` as used. Then, it increments `minn` until it finds the next smallest unused integer.
   - If the element is not positive (i.e., it is zero or negative), it calculates the value to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. It then marks this calculated value as used.
   - This process ensures that the `mex` list is constructed based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

3. **Output:**
   - After constructing the `mex` list, the program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

**Issues:**
- The program does not correctly handle the condition `a_i = mex(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Instead, it uses the absolute difference when the element is non-positive, which does not align with the problem's requirements.
- The logic for determining the next integer to append to `mex` does not correctly ensure that the resulting list `mex` is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1.

**Example Analysis:**
- For the first test case in the example, the correct `p` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`. However, the provided program does not correctly compute this permutation based on the given logic.
- The program's approach to handling non-positive elements in `arr` is incorrect, leading to incorrect values being appended to `mex`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the given conditions. The logic for constructing the permutation `p` based on the array `a` is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
