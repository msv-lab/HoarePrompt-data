The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`, and `used` does not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized by the `range` function, so we do not need to set it manually.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer value read from the input, where `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `used` is an empty dictionary**
