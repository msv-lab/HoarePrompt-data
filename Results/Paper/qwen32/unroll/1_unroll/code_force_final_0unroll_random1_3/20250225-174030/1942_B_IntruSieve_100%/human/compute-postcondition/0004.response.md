The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `used`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `used` is an empty dictionary.**
