The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It computes a list `mex` based on the values in `arr` and prints the elements of `mex` in a single line, separated by spaces. Each element in `mex` is determined by the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex` up to that point or the absolute difference between the current element in `arr` and the smallest non-negative integer not used, depending on whether the current element is positive or not. After processing the list, it prints an empty line.
