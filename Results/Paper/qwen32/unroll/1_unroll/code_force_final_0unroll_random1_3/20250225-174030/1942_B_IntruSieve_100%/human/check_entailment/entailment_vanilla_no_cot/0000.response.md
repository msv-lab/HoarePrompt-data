Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The logic for determining the MEX value and constructing the permutation `p` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where `a[i]` is negative and does not ensure that the constructed `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    mex = 0
    used = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex - a[i])
        used.add(p[-1])
        mex = 0  # Reset mex to 0 for the next iteration
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected version properly calculates the MEX value and constructs the permutation `p` by ensuring that the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` is satisfied.
