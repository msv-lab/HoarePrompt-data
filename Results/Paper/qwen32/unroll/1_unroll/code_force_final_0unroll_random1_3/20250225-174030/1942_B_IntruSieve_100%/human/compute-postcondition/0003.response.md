The code snippet provided initializes a variable `minn` with the value `0`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, or `mex`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other initial conditions intact.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0.**
