You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n; `mex` is a list of `n` integers computed based on the loop conditions; `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`; `used` is a dictionary of all unique values in `mex`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: the elements of `mex` printed in a single line, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It computes a list `mex` based on the values in `arr` and prints the elements of `mex` in a single line, separated by spaces. Each element in `mex` is determined by the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex` up to that point or the absolute difference between the current element in `arr` and the smallest non-negative integer not used, depending on whether the current element is positive or not. After processing the list, it prints an empty line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). The code is attempting to calculate the MEX and use it to determine the values of \( p \), but it does not correctly handle the relationship between \( a_i \) and \( p_i \) as described in the problem statement.

Specifically, the code incorrectly assumes that if \( a_i > 0 \), then \( p_i \) should be the current MEX, and if \( a_i \leq 0 \), then \( p_i \) should be \( \text{abs}(a_i - \text{minn}) \). This logic does not align with the problem's requirement that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the provided code will not necessarily produce this output. The logic in the code does not guarantee that the constructed \( p \) will satisfy the condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) for all \( i \).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to iteratively determine \( p_i \) by finding the MEX of the current prefix of \( p \) and ensuring that \( a_i = \text{MEX} - p_i \).

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = [False] * n
    p = []

    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while used[mex]:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex)
        used[mex] = True

        if mex - a[i] < 0 or mex - a[i] >= n or used[mex - a[i]]:
            raise ValueError("No valid permutation exists based on the given array a")

        used[mex - a[i]] = True

    print(" ".join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected code ensures that the constructed \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) for all \( i \).
