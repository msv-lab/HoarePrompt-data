Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. It only includes several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) that perform operations like reading input, converting input to integers, sorting, and calculating cumulative products. None of these functions address the task of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

To solve the problem, the code should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array elements.
3. Determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array.
4. Output the result for each test case.

Since the provided code does not implement the required logic, it is incorrect.
