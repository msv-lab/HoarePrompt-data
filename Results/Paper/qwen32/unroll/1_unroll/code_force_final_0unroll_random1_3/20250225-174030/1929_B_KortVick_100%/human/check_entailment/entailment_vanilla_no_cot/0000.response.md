Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for the given problem. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the handling of the case when `4 * n - 2 == k` and the general formula for calculating the minimum number of cells.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Case `4 * n - 2 == k`:** The program prints `k // 2 + 1` in this case. However, when all diagonals need to be colored (i.e., `k == 4 * n - 2`), the minimum number of cells required is `n`, not `k // 2 + 1`. This is because each diagonal can share cells with adjacent diagonals, and the most efficient way to cover all diagonals is to color one cell in each row and column, which totals `n` cells.

2. **General Case:** The program uses `ceil(k / 2)` to determine the number of cells, which is not correct. The correct approach involves understanding that diagonals can overlap, and the optimal strategy is to place cells in such a way that they cover the maximum number of diagonals. This often involves coloring cells along the main diagonal or in a pattern that maximizes diagonal coverage.

To solve the problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, considering the structure of the diagonals and how cells can be placed to cover multiple diagonals efficiently. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= n:
            print(k)
        elif k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(k - n + 1)

func()
```

This corrected program handles the problem by considering the structure of the diagonals and the optimal placement of cells to cover the required number of diagonals.
