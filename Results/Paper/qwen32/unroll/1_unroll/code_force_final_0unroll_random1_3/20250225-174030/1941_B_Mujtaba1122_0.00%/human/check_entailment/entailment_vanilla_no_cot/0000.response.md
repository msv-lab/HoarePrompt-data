Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation:**
   - The operation specified in the problem is to subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` when choosing index `i`. However, the code incorrectly subtracts `list[i-1]` times these values, which is not the intended operation.
   - The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Loop Condition:**
   - The `while` loop condition `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` is incorrect. It should be `list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` because the operation requires `a[i]` to be at least 2.
   - Additionally, the loop does not guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero, and it might not handle all edge cases correctly.

3. **Inadequate Check for All Zeros:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements are zero, but the logic in `func_2` does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero before calling `func_1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_all_zero(a, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while a[i] >= 2 and a[i - 1] > 0 and a[i + 1] > 0:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1

    # Check if all elements are zero
    for num in a:
        if num != 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    t = int(input[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))
        idx += 1
        if can_make_all_zero(a, n):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function when testing
# main()
```

This version correctly implements the logic to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operations and checks if it is possible to do so.
