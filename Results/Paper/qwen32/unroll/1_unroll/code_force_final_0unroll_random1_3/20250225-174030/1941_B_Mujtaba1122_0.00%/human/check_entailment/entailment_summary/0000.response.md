### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if we can make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation.
- The operation involves selecting an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and updating the array as follows:
  - `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`
  - `a_i = a_i - 2`
  - `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`
- We need to check if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation any number of times.

#### Functions Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - This is a correct implementation for checking if the array is all zeros.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to modify the list to make all elements zero using the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the list from the second element to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element, it checks if it can apply the operation (i.e., `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
   - If the operation can be applied, it updates the elements as per the operation.
   - However, the implementation of the operation is incorrect:
     - The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`.
     - The current implementation incorrectly subtracts `list[i-1]` times these values.
   - After attempting to make the elements zero, it uses `func_1` to check if the entire list is zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

#### Correctness:
- The logic for checking if the array is all zeros (`func_1`) is correct.
- However, the logic for modifying the array (`func_2`) is flawed due to the incorrect operation implementation.
- The incorrect operation implementation may lead to incorrect results, as it does not correctly apply the operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed implementation of the operation in `func_2`, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.

**Correctness: False**
