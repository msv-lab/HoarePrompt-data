To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus only on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 1, which means `n` must be at least 3. Given that `n` is already defined as a positive integer such that `n = len(list)` and `n >= 3`, `n` does not need adjustment.

The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the initial state of `i` must be 1 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n = len(list)` and `n >= 3`, `i` is 1**
