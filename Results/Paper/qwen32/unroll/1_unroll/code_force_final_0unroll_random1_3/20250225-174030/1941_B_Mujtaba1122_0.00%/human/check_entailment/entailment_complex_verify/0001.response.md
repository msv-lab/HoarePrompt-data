### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - The annotations confirm this behavior, stating that the function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros and returns `True` if they are, otherwise it returns `False`.
   - This function is implemented correctly according to the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the list zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive). For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0. If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - The annotations state that the operation is incorrectly implemented. The subtraction should be by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by `list[i-1]` times these values.
   - The annotations also state that the final state of the program after the loop is that `list[0]` is unchanged, `list[1]` to `list[n-2]` are all 0, and `list[n-1]` is unchanged.
   - Given the incorrect implementation, the function will not correctly reduce the array to zeros in most cases.

### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue is in the implementation of the operation. The operation should decrement `list[i-1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i+1]` by 1, but the current implementation incorrectly multiplies these values by `list[i-1]`.
- This incorrect implementation will not correctly reduce the array to zeros in most cases.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct operation should be:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
