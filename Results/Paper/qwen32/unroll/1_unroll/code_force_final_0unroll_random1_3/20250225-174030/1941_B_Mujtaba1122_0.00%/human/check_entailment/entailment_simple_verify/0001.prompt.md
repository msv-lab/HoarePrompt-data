You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):

for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):

        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: list is a list of integers where the first n elements are 0, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list). The function returns True.
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is a positive integer such that n = len(list) and n >= 3.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: list[0] is unchanged, list[1] to list[n-2] are all 0, list[n-1] is unchanged.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `list[0]` is unchanged, `list[1]` to `list[n-2]` are all 0, `list[n-1]` is unchanged, and `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to either true or false.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the list zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive). For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0. If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - The operation is incorrectly implemented. The subtraction should be by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by `list[i-1]` times these values.
   - After attempting to reduce the array, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue is in the implementation of the operation. The operation should decrement `list[i-1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i+1]` by 1, but the current implementation incorrectly multiplies these values by `list[i-1]`.
- This incorrect implementation will not correctly reduce the array to zeros in most cases.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct operation should be:
```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
