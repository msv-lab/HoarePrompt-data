The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with the characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it determines if the grid can be considered valid based on specific conditions: if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, then every cell in the first and last rows must be the same, and every cell in the first and last columns must be the same. It outputs 'YES' if the grid meets these conditions for each test case, otherwise 'NO'.
