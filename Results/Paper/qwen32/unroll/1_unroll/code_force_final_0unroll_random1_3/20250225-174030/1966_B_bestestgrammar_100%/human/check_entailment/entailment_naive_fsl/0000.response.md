Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the problem description. There are specific edge cases and scenarios where the program fails to provide the correct output.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:
1. The program checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) squares are the same color.
2. If they are different, it then checks if all squares in the first row and the last row are the same color.
3. Similarly, it checks if all squares in the first column and the last column are the same color.
4. If both conditions are satisfied, it concludes that it's impossible to make all squares the same color and sets `ans` to 'NO'.
5. Otherwise, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

However, this logic is insufficient to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. The problem description allows for operations that can change the color of any subrectangle where the selected squares are of the same color. Therefore, the program needs to consider more complex patterns and configurations within the grid.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
BWW
WBW
WWB
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In this grid, the top-left square is 'B' and the bottom-right square is 'B'. However, it's impossible to make all squares the same color using the allowed operations because there are no two squares of the same color that can cover the entire grid.

The program will incorrectly output 'YES' for this input because it only checks the first and last rows and columns, which in this case appear to satisfy the conditions, even though it's not possible to make the entire grid the same color.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
