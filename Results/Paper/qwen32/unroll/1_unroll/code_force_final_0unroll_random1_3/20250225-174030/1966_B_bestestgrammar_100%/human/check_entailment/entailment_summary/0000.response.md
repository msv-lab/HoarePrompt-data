### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. The approach taken by the program is based on a key observation: if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) corners of the grid are different colors, then for the grid to be made uniform, all cells in the first and last rows and all cells in the first and last columns must be of the same color. This is because the operation can only be performed on squares of the same color, and the corners being different implies that a single color cannot be spread across the entire grid unless there are uniform rows and columns at the edges.

The program correctly implements this logic by:
1. Checking if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
2. If they are different, it then checks if all cells in the first and last rows are the same and if all cells in the first and last columns are the same.
3. If either the rows or columns do not meet the uniformity condition, it sets the answer to 'NO'.
4. If the corners are the same, it directly sets the answer to 'YES' since the grid is already uniform or can be made uniform by repeated operations.

This logic is sound and aligns with the problem constraints and requirements. The program handles multiple test cases efficiently within the given limits.

### Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the grid can be made uniform under the given operations. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem description accurately.
