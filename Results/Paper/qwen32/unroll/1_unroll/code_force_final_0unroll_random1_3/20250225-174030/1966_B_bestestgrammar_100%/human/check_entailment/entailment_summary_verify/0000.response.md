Let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make all squares in an `n x m` grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them to that color.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code follows these steps for each test case:
1. It reads the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m`.
2. It reads the grid itself.
3. It initializes the answer `ans` to 'YES'.
4. If the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) squares are different, it checks:
   - If all squares in the first row and the last row are the same color.
   - If all squares in the first column and the last column are the same color.
5. If both conditions are satisfied, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
6. Otherwise, it keeps `ans` as 'YES'.
7. It prints the answer for each test case.

### Function Summary Recap
The function summary states that the program checks the top-left and bottom-right corners. If they are different, it checks if all cells in the first and last rows and columns are the same. If both conditions are satisfied, it concludes that it's impossible to make all squares the same color and sets `ans` to 'NO'. Otherwise, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases. It provides a counterexample where the program incorrectly outputs 'YES' for a grid that cannot be made uniform.

### Detailed Analysis
The logic in the provided code is flawed. The program only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. The problem allows for more complex operations that can change the color of any subrectangle where the selected squares are of the same color. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:
- If the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same, the program immediately assumes it's possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is incorrect because there might be other configurations within the grid that prevent uniformity.
- If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, the program checks if all cells in the first and last rows and columns are the same. This is also insufficient because it does not account for other patterns within the grid.

### Counterexample Analysis
The counterexample provided in the original assessment is:
```
1
3 3
BWW
WBW
WWB
```
- The top-left square is 'B' and the bottom-right square is 'B'.
- The first row is `BWW` and the last row is `WWB`, which are not all the same.
- The first column is `BWB` and the last column is `WBB`, which are not all the same.
- Since the top-left and bottom-right are the same, the program would output 'YES', which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. It fails to handle more complex configurations and patterns within the grid.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
