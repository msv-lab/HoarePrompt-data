The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which iterates over the range defined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The initial state already specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, which means the loop can execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Since the loop variable `tc` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can infer that it is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, which is typical in Python's `range` function. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `tc` itself, but we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
