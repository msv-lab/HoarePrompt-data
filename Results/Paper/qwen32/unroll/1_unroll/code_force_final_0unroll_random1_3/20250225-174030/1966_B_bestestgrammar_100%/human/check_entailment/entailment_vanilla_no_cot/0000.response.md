Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The logic used in the program is flawed because it only checks the corners of the grid and the edges, but it does not ensure that the entire grid can be filled with a single color using the allowed operations.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if there is a single color that can dominate the grid. If all cells can be connected through a path of the same color, then it is possible to make the entire grid that color. The provided program does not perform this check and incorrectly assumes that just checking the corners and edges is sufficient.

Here's a more correct approach:

1. Check if all cells in the grid are already the same color.
2. If not, check if there is a path of the same color from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner (or any other corner), which would imply that the entire grid can be filled with that color using the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all cells are the same color
        all_same_color = True
        first_color = gr[0][0]
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if gr[i][j] != first_color:
                    all_same_color = False
                    break
            if not all_same_color:
                break
        
        if all_same_color:
            print("YES")
            continue
        
        # If not all the same, check if there is a path of the same color from (0,0) to (n-1,m-1)
        def is_connected(color):
            visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
            stack = [(0, 0)]
            visited[0][0] = True
            
            while stack:
                x, y = stack.pop()
                if x == n - 1 and y == m - 1:
                    return True
                for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and gr[nx][ny] == color:
                        visited[nx][ny] = True
                        stack.append((nx, ny))
            return False
        
        if is_connected(gr[0][0]) or is_connected(gr[n - 1][m - 1]):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This program checks if all cells are the same color, and if not, it uses a depth-first search (DFS) to check if there is a path of the same color from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. If such a path exists, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".
