Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 24) and a matrix of size n x n. Each element in the matrix is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (if the row index equals the column index). The matrix is symmetric, meaning the element at position (i, j) is the same as the element at position (j, i). There are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters in the matrix. The function returns a value that is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, but it presumably processes the matrix based on the given constraints.**
