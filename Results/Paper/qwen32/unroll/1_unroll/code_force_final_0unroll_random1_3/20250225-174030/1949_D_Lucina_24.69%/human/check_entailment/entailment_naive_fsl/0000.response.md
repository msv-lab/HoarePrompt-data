Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not guarantee that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. 

The approach taken in the code is to distribute 'F' and 'S' based on the initial counts of 'F' and 'S' in the input matrix. However, this does not ensure that the constraint of having no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met for every possible permutation of scenarios.

Here's a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
5
.FF??
F.F??
FF?.?
??.??
???.?
```

**Output from the code:**
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.FF
FFF.?
FF?.?
```

**Explanation of the issue:**
- The code assigns 'F' and 'S' based on the initial counts and some heuristic (assigning 'F' to nodes with more 'F' connections and 'S' to nodes with more 'S' connections).
- However, for the permutation (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the sequence of transitions is "FFF", which violates the constraint because \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) and we have 3 consecutive 'F's.
- The code does not ensure that the constraint is met for all permutations, which is a requirement of the problem.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the constraint for all possible permutations of scenarios.
