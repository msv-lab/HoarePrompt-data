You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array a. The next line contains n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array x. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is a list of n integers where the first integer is 1000 and each subsequent integer is the sum of the previous integer in the list and the corresponding element from the input list x.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it generates and prints an array `a` of length `n`. The first element of `a` is set to 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element from the input list `x`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \), find any array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes \( a_1 \) to 1000. This is a valid choice since \( 1000 \) is within the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).
2. **Generating \( a_i \) for \( i \geq 2 \)**: The program sets \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \).

Let's verify if this satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \):
- For \( i = 2 \):
  \[
  a_2 = a_1 + x_1 = 1000 + x_1
  \]
  \[
  x_1 = a_2 \bmod a_1 = (1000 + x_1) \bmod 1000 = x_1
  \]
  This is correct.
- For \( i = 3 \):
  \[
  a_3 = a_2 + x_2 = (1000 + x_1) + x_2 = 1000 + x_1 + x_2
  \]
  \[
  x_2 = a_3 \bmod a_2 = (1000 + x_1 + x_2) \bmod (1000 + x_1)
  \]
  Since \( 1000 + x_1 + x_2 \) is \( x_2 \) more than \( 1000 + x_1 \), the remainder is \( x_2 \). This is correct.
- This pattern continues for all \( i \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates an array \( a \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \). It initializes \( a_1 \) to 1000 and sets \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \) for \( i \geq 2 \). This ensures the conditions are met for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.
