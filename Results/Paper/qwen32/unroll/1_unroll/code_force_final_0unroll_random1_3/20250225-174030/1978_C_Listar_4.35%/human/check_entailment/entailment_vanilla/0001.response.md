To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`

This function is supposed to generate a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`. The function first divides `k` by 2. Then, it creates a list `l` containing the numbers from 1 to `n`. It iterates over the list in reverse order, adjusting the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

However, the logic inside the loop is not clear and seems to be incorrect or incomplete. The function attempts to manipulate the list based on the value of `k`, but it does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k`. The condition `if 1 + i > k` is not well-explained and does not seem to correctly handle the case where `k` needs to be reduced.

### Function 2: `func_2()`

This function reads the input values `n` and `k` for a test case. It checks if `k` is odd, and if so, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating that no such permutation exists because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even. It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` and checks if `k` is greater than this maximum value. If `k` is too large, it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

The logic here seems correct. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed `n^2 // 2` (or `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd) because the maximum deviation of each element from its position is `n-1`, and there are `n` elements.

### Function 3: `func_3(l)`

This function takes a list `l` and prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list on a single line. This part of the program is correct and does what it is intended to do.

### Function 4: `func_4()`

This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2()` to get the values of `n` and `k` for the current test case. If `n` is 0 (which indicates that no valid permutation exists), it prints "NO". Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3(l)` to print the result.

### Overall Analysis

The main issue lies in `func_1(n, k)`. The logic for generating the permutation with the exact Manhattan value `k` is unclear and likely incorrect. The function does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the correct Manhattan value, and the conditions inside the loop do not seem to handle all cases properly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program is not guaranteed to produce correct results for all inputs because `func_1(n, k)` does not correctly generate the permutation with the desired Manhattan value `k`.

**Correctness: False**
