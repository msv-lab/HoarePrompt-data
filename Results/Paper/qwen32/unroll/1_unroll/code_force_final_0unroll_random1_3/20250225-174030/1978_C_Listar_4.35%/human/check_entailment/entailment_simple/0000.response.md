### Reasoning:

The task is to determine if a given Python program correctly solves the problem of finding a permutation of length \( n \) with a specific Manhattan value \( k \). Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
2. **Validation of \( k \)**: The program checks if \( k \) is achievable with the given \( n \).
3. **Generating Permutation**: The program generates a permutation with the required Manhattan value.
4. **Output**: The program prints "Yes" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation exists, otherwise "No".

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Validation of \( k \)**:
   - The function `func_2` checks if \( k \) is even. If not, it returns `0, 0` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value \( \text{max\_k} \) for the given \( n \). This value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if \( n \) is odd and \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) if \( n \) is even.
   - If \( k \) exceeds \( \text{max\_k} \), it returns `0, 0` indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

3. **Generating Permutation**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to generate a permutation with the required Manhattan value.
   - It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It then iteratively modifies this permutation to increase the Manhattan value by moving elements around.
   - The logic involves moving the last element to a specific position to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid permutation is found, `func_3` prints "Yes" followed by the permutation.
   - If no valid permutation is found, the program prints "No".

#### Issues and Considerations:
- The program correctly checks if \( k \) is achievable based on \( n \).
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be an attempt to construct a permutation with the required Manhattan value. However, the correctness of this logic needs to be verified.
- The program handles large inputs efficiently, given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the problem requirements and constraints. It correctly validates \( k \) and attempts to generate a valid permutation. Based on the provided example test cases, the output matches the expected results.

**Correctness: True**
