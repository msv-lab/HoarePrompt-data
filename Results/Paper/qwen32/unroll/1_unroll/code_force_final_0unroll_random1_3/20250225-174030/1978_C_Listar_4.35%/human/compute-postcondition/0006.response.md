Output State: **`n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`. `func_3(l)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the return values of `func_2()`. The value of `l` also remains the same as it is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`. The function `func_3(l)` is executed, but it does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, or `l` directly.
