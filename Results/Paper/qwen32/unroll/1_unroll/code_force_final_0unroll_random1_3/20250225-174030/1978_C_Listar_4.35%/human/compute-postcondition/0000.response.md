The code snippet `n, k = func_2()` indicates that the values of `n` and `k` are being reassigned to the return values of the function `func_2()`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), after the function call, `n` and `k` will take on whatever values `func_2()` returns.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`.**
