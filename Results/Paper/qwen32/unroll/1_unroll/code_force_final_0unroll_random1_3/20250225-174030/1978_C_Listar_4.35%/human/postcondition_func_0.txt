The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It returns a list that is a rotated version of the list `[1, 2, ..., n]` based on the value of `k`. The rotation is determined by a specific algorithm that manipulates the list elements according to the value of `k`.
