### Reasoning:
The program aims to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset where the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x` and there are exactly `n` sub-problems. The balance of the problemset is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

The program iterates through potential divisors `i` up to the square root of `x` to check if `i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems. For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
1. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `i` is a valid candidate for the balance.
2. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, then `x // i` is another valid candidate for the balance.

The maximum of these valid candidates is then chosen as the balance.

### Verification Against Test Cases:
1. **First Test Case (x = 10, n = 3):**
   - The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
   - Checking with `i = 1`: `(10 - 3*1) = 7` which is not divisible by 1.
   - Checking with `i = 2`: `(10 - 3*2) = 4` which is divisible by 2.
   - Checking with `i = 5`: `(10 - 3*5) = -5` which is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 10`: `(10 - 3*10) = -20` which is negative.
   - The valid candidates are 1 and 2. The maximum is 2.
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Second Test Case (x = 5, n = 5):**
   - The divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
   - Checking with `i = 1`: `(5 - 5*1) = 0` which is divisible by 1.
   - Checking with `i = 5`: `(5 - 5*5) = -20` which is negative.
   - The only valid candidate is 1.
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Third Test Case (x = 420, n = 69):**
   - The divisors of 420 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
   - Checking with `i = 6`: `(420 - 69*6) = 6` which is divisible by 6.
   - Checking with `i = 60`: `(420 - 69*60)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 7`: `(420 - 69*7) = -27` which is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 14`: `(420 - 69*14)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 21`: `(420 - 69*21) = -99` which is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 30`: `(420 - 69*30)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 35`: `(420 - 69*35)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 42`: `(420 - 69*42)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 6`: `(420 - 69*6) = 6` which is divisible by 6.
   - Checking with `i = 70`: `(420 - 69*70)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 84`: `(420 - 69*84)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 105`: `(420 - 69*105)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 140`: `(420 - 69*140)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 210`: `(420 - 69*210)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 420`: `(420 - 69*420)` is negative.
   - Checking with `i = 6`: `(420 - 69*6) = 6` which is divisible by 6.
   - Checking with `i = 6`: `(420 - 69*6) = 6` which is divisible by 6.
   - Checking with `i = 6`: `(420 - 69*6) = 6` which is divisible by 6.
   - The valid candidates are 1, 2, 3, 6. The maximum is 6.
   - This matches the expected output.
