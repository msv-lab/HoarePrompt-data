`t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the list `data`. The value of `idx` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by spaces; `idx` is 0; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by spaces; `idx` is 0; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
