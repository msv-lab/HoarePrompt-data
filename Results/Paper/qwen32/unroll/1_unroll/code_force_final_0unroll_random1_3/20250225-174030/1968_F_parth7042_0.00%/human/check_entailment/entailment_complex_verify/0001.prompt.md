You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range whose XOR is zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by an empty line after each test case's results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if a subarray is "interesting" based on the criteria given in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the individual queries `(l, r)`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `mp` that maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR `0` (since XOR of an empty set is `0`), so it appends 'YES' to the results.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a prefix XOR value that can divide the subarray into parts with equal XOR.
   - It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the prefix XOR list to check if a valid split exists.
   - If such a split exists, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for a test case, it appends a newline character to separate the results of different test cases.
   - Finally, it prints all results joined by newline characters.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Prefix XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR calculation is correct and allows for efficient computation of the XOR of any subarray.
  
- **Handling Trivial Case (`x == 0`):**
  - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR `0`, so the program correctly returns 'YES'.
  
- **Checking for Valid Splits:**
  - The program uses the prefix XOR dictionary to check for valid splits efficiently.
  - It uses binary search to find the appropriate indices in the prefix XOR list, ensuring that the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR.
  - The logic for finding valid splits is sound and should work correctly for the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" based on the given criteria. It efficiently handles the input constraints and provides the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
