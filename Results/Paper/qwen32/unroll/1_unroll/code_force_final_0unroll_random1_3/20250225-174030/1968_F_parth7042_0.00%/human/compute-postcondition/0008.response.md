Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of a list of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` follows, with each integer being between 0 and \(2^{30}\). For each of the `q` queries, the function receives two integers `l` and `r` representing a subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r`. The function returns the sum of the integers in each queried subarray.**
