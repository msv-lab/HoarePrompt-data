The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. Since `ans` initially contains the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, the sum of `ans` is the sum of these powers of 2.

Let's denote the sum of the first `lk - 1` powers of 2 as `S`. Therefore, the new element appended to `ans` is `k - 1 - S`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`**.
