### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of generating a sequence of non-negative integers that meets specific conditions related to the sum of its subsequences. Here's a detailed analysis of the program's correctness based on the provided functions and their execution summaries:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_14()` reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case using `func_7()`, which splits the input line and converts the components to integers.

2. **Logic for Sequence Generation:**
   - **Case when `k == 1`:**
     - If `n == 2`, the sequence is simply `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` minus 2. This ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.
   - **Case when `k != 1`:**
     - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
     - It then includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to avoid forming the sum `k` while ensuring other sums up to `n` can be formed.
     - Finally, it continues with powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Output:**
   - `func_14()` returns the length of the generated sequence followed by the sequence itself as a space-separated string.
   - `func_15()` iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_14()` for each and writing the result to standard output.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **Condition 1:** There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` ensures that no combination of these elements can sum up to `k`.
- **Condition 2:** For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
  - The use of powers of 2 and additional carefully chosen elements ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case. It handles both cases (`k == 1` and `k != 1`) appropriately and ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.

**Correctness:** **True**
