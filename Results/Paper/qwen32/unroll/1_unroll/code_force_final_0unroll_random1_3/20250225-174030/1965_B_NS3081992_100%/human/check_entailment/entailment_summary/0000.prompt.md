Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads a line from the standard input, removes the trailing newline character, and returns the result as a byte string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a single line from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns this string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:

def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a positive integer `rows` representing the number of test cases and returns a list containing the result of `func_7()` called `rows` number of times.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns the value provided by the user input.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads an integer input from the user and returns it, representing the number of test cases, where the integer is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()

 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` calculates a rank value for a given key `da` in the dictionary `d` by recursively processing the values associated with `da`. If the list associated with `da` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list at index `da - 1` with the minimum rank value obtained from recursive calls plus one and returns this value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` takes two integer parameters, `a` (the dividend) and `b` (the divisor). If `b` is 0, it returns the tuple (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calculates and returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where y, x, and g are determined by the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, along with the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` generates a list of integers based on the values of `n` and `k` obtained from `func_7()`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of specific powers of 2 and additional calculated values, then returns the length of this list followed by its elements as a space-separated string.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline to the standard output, repeating this process a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.
