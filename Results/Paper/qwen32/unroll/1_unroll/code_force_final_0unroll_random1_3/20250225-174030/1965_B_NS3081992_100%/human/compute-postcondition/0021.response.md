Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with `n` and `k` updated to the values returned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is `[2, 3]` extended by `2`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the first `l * k - 1` powers of 2, followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)` (where `sum(ans)` is the sum of the first `l * k - 1` powers of 2), then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from `2`.**
