The provided code snippet only initializes a list `ans` with the values `[2, 3]`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `k`, `n`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with `n` and `k` updated to the values returned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. `n` is not equal to 2. `ans` is [2, 3].**
