You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n over the tuples does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #The program returns a string where each character from all strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its mirrored counterpart from the `mapping` dictionary.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We need to decode a string `b` which was encoded using a specific algorithm.
2. The encoding algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct letters in `b` sorted alphabetically.
3. Each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.
4. To decode, we need to reverse this process:
   - Identify the auxiliary string `r` by finding all distinct characters in `b` and sorting them.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping to get the original string `s`.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It generates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It then constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `mapping`.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic for generating `r` and the mapping is correct.
- The replacement process using the mapping is also correct.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through them and processing each one independently.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

For the first test case:
- `b = "serofedsoc"`
- `r = "cdefors"`
- Mapping: `c->s`, `d->r`, `e->o`, `f->e`, `o->e`, `r->d`, `s->c`
- Decoding `b` using the mapping results in `s = "codeforces"`.

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
