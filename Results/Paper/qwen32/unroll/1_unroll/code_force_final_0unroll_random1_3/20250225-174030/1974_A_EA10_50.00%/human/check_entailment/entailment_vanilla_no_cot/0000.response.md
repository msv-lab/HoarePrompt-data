Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of screens needed for the given problem. Let's analyze the logic and the given code.

The program attempts to calculate the number of screens needed by first considering the 2x2 icons and then the 1x1 icons. However, the logic to calculate `z` (the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons) and the subsequent calculations for 1x1 icons are incorrect.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of `z`**: The line `z = (y + 1) // 2` is intended to calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. This is correct because each screen can fit at most 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons (one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right, or one in the top-right and one in the bottom-left). However, the subsequent calculation `m = 15 * z - y * 4` is incorrect and does not serve a meaningful purpose in the context of the problem.

2. **Calculation of additional screens for 1x1 icons**: The line `if m < a: z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is intended to calculate the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, `m` is calculated incorrectly, and the logic to add screens for 1x1 icons is flawed. Specifically, the variable `a` (the total number of test cases) is used in the comparison `if m < a:`, which is incorrect and does not reflect the intended logic.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- First calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- Then calculate the remaining space on these screens and determine how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2
        # Calculate remaining 1x1 slots on these screens
        remaining_slots = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4
        # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens = (x - remaining_slots + 14) // 15 if x > remaining_slots else 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
