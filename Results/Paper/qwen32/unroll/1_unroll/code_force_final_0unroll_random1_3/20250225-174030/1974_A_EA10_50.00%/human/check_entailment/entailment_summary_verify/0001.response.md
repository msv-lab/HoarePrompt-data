### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum number of 5x3 grids (screens) required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen can hold up to 15 cells.

#### Key Points:
1. **Grid Size**: 5x3, which means 15 cells per screen.
2. **Icons**:
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells.
3. **Constraints**:
   - Each cell can hold only one icon.
   - We need to minimize the number of screens.

#### Strategy:
1. **Place 2x2 Icons First**: Since 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, they should be placed first to maximize the use of space.
2. **Calculate Remaining Space**: After placing 2x2 icons, calculate the remaining space and place the 1x1 icons.
3. **Determine Number of Screens**: Calculate how many screens are required based on the total number of cells occupied.

#### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program and see if it follows the strategy correctly.

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `a` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This formula is incorrect for determining the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. Each 5x3 screen can fit a maximum of 3 2x2 icons without overlap. Therefore, the correct formula should be `z = (y + 2) // 3`.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space**:
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the actual arrangement of 2x2 icons on the screen.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `if m < a`: This condition is incorrect. It should be checking if there are any remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons and if 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells.
   - `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`: This formula is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would be:
1. Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
3. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons based on the remaining cells.

### Correct Formula
1. **Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `z = (y + 2) // 3`: This formula ensures that we account for the fact that each screen can fit a maximum of 3 2x2 icons.

2. **Remaining Cells**:
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * z - y * 4`: This formula calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.

3. **Number of Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `additional_screens = (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15`: This formula calculates the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons based on the remaining cells.

4. **Total Screens**:
   - `total_screens = z + additional_screens`: This formula gives the total number of screens required.

### Conclusion

Given the incorrect logic and formulas used in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
