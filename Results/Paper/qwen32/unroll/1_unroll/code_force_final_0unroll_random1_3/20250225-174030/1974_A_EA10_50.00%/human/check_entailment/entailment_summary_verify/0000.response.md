### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Provided Program Analysis

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Problem Description Recap

- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of 5x3 screens.
- Each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5 rows * 3 columns).
- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so we need to account for this when placing them.
- The goal is to determine the minimal number of screens needed for each test case.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `z`**:
    - `z = (y + 1) // 2` is an attempt to calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. This calculation is correct for ceiling division, but it does not consider the space left after placing these 2x2 icons.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**:
    - `m = 15 * z - y * 4` calculates the remaining space after placing `y` 2x2 icons, but it is not used correctly in the subsequent logic. The value of `m` should represent the remaining space available for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

3. **Incorrect Usage of `a`**:
    - The variable `a` is used as the number of test cases, but it is also used in the condition `if m < a`. This comparison is incorrect and does not reflect the logic needed to determine the number of screens.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Placing Icons**:
    - The logic to place 1x1 and 2x2 icons is not correctly implemented.
    - The program does not account for the fact that a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and it does not correctly calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`y`).
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.
3. Place the remaining 1x1 icons (`x`) in the available space.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 2 - 1) // 2  # Ceiling division
        # Calculate the remaining space in these screens
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x - remaining_space + 15 - 1) // 15 if x > remaining_space else 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
