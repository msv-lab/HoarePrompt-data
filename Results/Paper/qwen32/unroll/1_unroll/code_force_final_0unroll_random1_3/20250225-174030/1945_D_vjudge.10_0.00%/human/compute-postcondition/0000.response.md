The code snippet provided is `x = int(input())`. This line of code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state mentions several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`), but none of these are affected by the execution of this line of code. The only change is that a new variable `x` is introduced and assigned an integer value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` is an input integer.**
