To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `N` is set to 200001.
   - `t` is the number of test cases (input integer).
   - `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 200000` (since the range is `range(1, N)`).
   - For each `i`, it performs the following operations:
     - `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]`: This means `pd[i]` accumulates the value of `pd[i - 1]`.
     - The inner loop iterates over each digit `j` in the string representation of `i`:
       - `pd[i] += int(j)`: This adds the integer value of each digit of `i` to `pd[i]`.

3. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - `pd[i]` at the end of the loop will contain the sum of all previous `pd` values up to `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - Essentially, `pd[i]` will hold a cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `1` to `i`.

Let's illustrate this with a small example:

- For `i = 1`, `pd[1] = pd[0] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
- For `i = 2`, `pd[2] = pd[1] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3`.
- For `i = 10`, `pd[10] = pd[9] + 1 + 0 = 45 + 1 = 46`.

After the loop finishes, each `pd[i]` will have the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `1` to `i`.

**Output State**: The `pd` list will have been updated where `pd[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `1` to `i` for all `i` from `1` to `200000`. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pd` list updated with cumulative sums of digit sums, `t` and `N` unchanged.**
