The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a conventional name for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `pd` list updated with cumulative sums of digit sums
- `t` and `N` unchanged

The state of `pd` and `N` do not affect whether the loop will execute. The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`pd` list updated with cumulative sums of digit sums, `t` must be greater than 0, `N` unchanged**
