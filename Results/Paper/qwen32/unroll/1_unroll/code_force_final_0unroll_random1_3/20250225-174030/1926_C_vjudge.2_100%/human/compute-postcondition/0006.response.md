To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the operations within the loop and how the variables are affected. The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads an integer `n` from the input, and then it prints the value at index `n` of the list `pd`.

Given the initial state:
- `pd` is a list that contains cumulative sums of digit sums.
- `t` is the number of iterations for the loop.
- `N` is mentioned to be unchanged.

The loop body does not modify `pd`, `t`, or `N`. It only reads from `pd` based on the input `n` and prints the corresponding value.

Since the loop body does not change the values of `pd`, `t`, or `N`, the state of these variables remains the same after the loop finishes executing. The only change is that the values at specific indices of `pd` are printed `t` times, but this does not alter the state of `pd`, `t`, or `N`.

Output State: **`pd` list updated with cumulative sums of digit sums, `t` and `N` unchanged.**
