Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers: `n` (the total number of vertices), `x` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `y` (an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). It also accepts a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
