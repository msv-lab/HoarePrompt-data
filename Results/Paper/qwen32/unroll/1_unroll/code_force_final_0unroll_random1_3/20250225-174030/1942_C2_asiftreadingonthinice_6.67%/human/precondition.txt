t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple where the first element is an integer n such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the second element is an integer x such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and the third element is an integer y such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The fourth element of each test case is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
