You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2

    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.

#### Key Points:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We can form triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between chosen vertices.
2. **Maximize Triangles**: The goal is to maximize the number of triangles formed.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`
   - `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)`
   - `0 ≤ y ≤ n - x`
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces.

### Code Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, read `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the list of vertices to facilitate the calculation of gaps between chosen vertices.
3. **Initialization**: Initialize `ans` to `x + y - 2`, which seems to be an initial guess for the number of triangles.
4. **Gap Calculation**: Iterate through the sorted list of vertices and calculate gaps between consecutive vertices. If a gap is 2, it means we can form an additional triangle. If the gap is even and we have enough additional vertices (`y`), we can form more triangles.
5. **Circular Gap**: Check the gap between the last and the first vertex to account for the circular nature of the polygon.
6. **Adjustment**: Add any remaining `y` vertices to the answer.
7. **Output**: Print the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, which is the maximum number of triangles possible in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Gap Handling**: The code does not correctly handle the logic for calculating triangles from gaps. Specifically, the formula `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for adding triangles from a gap is incorrect. The correct approach involves understanding how additional vertices can be used to form triangles.
2. **Circular Gap Logic**: The logic for handling the circular gap is incorrect. The condition `elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:` uses the wrong index `i`, which should be `0` or `len(a) - 1`.
3. **Final Adjustment**: Adding `y` directly to `ans` without proper logic can lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the code, particularly the incorrect handling of gaps and the final adjustment, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all test cases.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. It requires a more accurate approach to handle gaps and the use of additional vertices.
