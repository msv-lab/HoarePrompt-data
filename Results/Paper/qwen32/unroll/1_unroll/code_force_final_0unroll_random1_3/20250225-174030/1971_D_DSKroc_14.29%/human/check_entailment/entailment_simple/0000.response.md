### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) into which a binary string can be cut, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The solution provided iterates through each test case, reading a binary string `s`. It then counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string. This count indicates the number of "boundaries" where a cut is necessary to ensure that all '0's can be moved to the left of all '1's. Adding 1 to this count gives the minimum number of pieces required.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `11010`
   - **Process:** The string has two transitions from '1' to '0' (at indices 1 and 3). Thus, `count = 2`, and the result is `count + 1 = 3`.
   - **Output:** `3` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - **Process:** There are no transitions from '1' to '0'. Thus, `count = 0`, and the result is `count + 1 = 1`.
   - **Output:** `1` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1`
   - **Process:** There are no transitions from '1' to '0'. Thus, `count = 0`, and the result is `count + 1 = 1`.
   - **Output:** `1` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `10`
   - **Process:** There is one transition from '1' to '0' (at index 0). Thus, `count = 1`, and the result is `count + 1 = 2`.
   - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - **Process:** There are no transitions from '1' to '0'. Thus, `count = 0`, and the result is `count + 1 = 1`.
   - **Output:** `1` (Correct)

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - **Process:** There is one transition from '1' to '0' (at index 2). Thus, `count = 1`, and the result is `count + 1 = 2`.
   - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

The solution correctly handles all the given test cases by counting the number of transitions from '1' to '0' and adding 1 to this count to get the minimum number of pieces.

### Correctness: **True**
