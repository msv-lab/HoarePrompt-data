You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: For each test case, the number of segments the string `s` can be divided into such that each segment is non-decreasing is printed. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` is the last input string processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The provided program correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The logic is based on the observation that each time a '1' is followed by a '0', a cut is needed to separate the two segments. This ensures that all '0's can be grouped together and all '1's can be grouped together.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
- It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
- It iterates through the string, comparing each character with the next one.
- If a '1' is followed by a '0' (i.e., `int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])`), it increments the `count`.
- Finally, it prints `count + 1` because the number of pieces needed is one more than the number of cuts.

This approach correctly handles the following scenarios:
- Strings that are already sorted (either all '0's or all '1's or a sequence of '0's followed by '1's) require only one piece.
- Strings with alternating '0's and '1's require multiple pieces, with the number of pieces being equal to the number of transitions from '1' to '0' plus one.

The program has been tested with the provided examples and works as expected. No edge cases have been identified where the program fails to produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct.
