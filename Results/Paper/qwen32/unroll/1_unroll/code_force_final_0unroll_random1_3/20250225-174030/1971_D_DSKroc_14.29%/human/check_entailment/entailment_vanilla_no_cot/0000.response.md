Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly determines the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The logic is based on counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string. Each such transition indicates that a cut is necessary to separate the pieces that need to be rearranged. The final result is the count of these transitions plus one, as the initial segment before any transition also counts as a piece.
