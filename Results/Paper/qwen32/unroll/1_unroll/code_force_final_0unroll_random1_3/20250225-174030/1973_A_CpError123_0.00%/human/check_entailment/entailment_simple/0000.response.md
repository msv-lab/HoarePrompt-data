Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and verify its logic against the problem statement.

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The program calculates the total points (`total_points`) by summing up the scores of the three players. This is correct because the total points should reflect the sum of all points awarded in the games.

2. **Odd Total Points Check**: If `total_points` is odd, it is impossible to have a valid set of games because each game results in a total of 2 points distributed between the two players (either 2-0 or 1-1). Therefore, the program correctly appends `-1` to the results if `total_points` is odd.

3. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) by dividing `total_points` by 2. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total.

4. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is a valid check because:
   - The maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is 3 (each player plays against the other two).
   - `p3` cannot be greater than `total_matchs` because each match can contribute at most 2 points to the highest score.

5. **Draw Calculation**: The program calculates the number of draws (`egalites`) using the formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the observation that:
   - The difference between `p3` and `p2` (and `p3` and `p1`) represents the points that `p3` has earned by winning against `p2` (and `p1`).
   - The remaining points must have come from draws.
   - Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, so the number of draws is half of the remaining points.

6. **Negative Draws Check**: If the calculated number of draws is negative, it indicates an inconsistency in the scores, so the program appends `-1` to the results.

7. **Appending Results**: If the number of draws is non-negative, the program appends it to the results.

The provided program correctly handles all the edge cases and checks for consistency in the scores. It also correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
