You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players. It returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer is either `-1` or a non-negative integer indicating the number of matches that ended in a draw for each test case. If the conditions for a valid number of draws are not met, `-1` is returned for that test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total points across all three players: `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - Since each game awards exactly 2 points (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in a draw), `total_points` must be even. If not, the scores are invalid, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played: `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total.

3. **Maximum Possible Matches:**
   - The program checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. This check is incorrect.
     - `total_matchs > 3` is not a valid constraint because the maximum number of matches is not inherently limited to 3. For example, three players could play more than 3 matches.
     - `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because `p3` is a score, not a count of matches. A player's score can be higher than the total number of matches if they win multiple matches.

4. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The program calculates the number of draws as `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
     - This formula is intended to determine how many points are not attributed to wins (i.e., points from draws).
     - If `egalites < 0`, it means the calculated number of draws is invalid, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.
     - If `egalites >= 0`, it calculates the number of draws as `egalites // 2` and appends this to the results.

### Issues Identified:
- The checks `total_matchs > 3` and `p3 > total_matchs` are incorrect and should be removed.

### Corrected Program:
Let's remove the incorrect checks and see if the program works correctly.

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats

t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

### Testing the Corrected Program:
Let's test the corrected program with the provided test cases.

```python
# Expected output: 0 1 -1 2 -1 6 2
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

The output from the corrected program matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The original program was incorrect due to the incorrect checks `total_matchs > 3` and `p3 > total_matchs`. After removing these checks, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or determines if the scores are invalid.

Correctness: **False** (the original program was incorrect due to the mentioned issues, but the corrected version is correct)
