To determine the output state after the execution of the given loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each tuple in the `cas_de_test` list and modifies the `resultats` list based on the conditions specified.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's logic:
1. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`:
   - Calculate `total_points` as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - Check if `total_points` is odd. If it is, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next iteration.
   - Calculate `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`.
   - Check if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. If either condition is true, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next iteration.
   - Calculate `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, append `-1` to `resultats`.
   - Otherwise, append `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

The `resultats` list will contain the results of each test case after the loop has processed all tuples in `cas_de_test`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30.
- `resultats` is an empty list.

After the loop executes all iterations, the `resultats` list will contain the results of each test case, which are either `-1` (indicating an invalid case) or a non-negative integer representing the number of matches that ended in a draw.

Output State: **`resultats` is a list of integers where each integer is either `-1` or a non-negative integer representing the number of matches that ended in a draw for each corresponding test case in `cas_de_test`. The value of `t` and the structure of `cas_de_test` remain unchanged.**
