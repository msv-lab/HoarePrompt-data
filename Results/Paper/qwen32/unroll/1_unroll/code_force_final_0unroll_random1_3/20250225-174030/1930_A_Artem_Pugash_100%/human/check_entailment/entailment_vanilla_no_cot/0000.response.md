Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. By sorting the list of numbers and summing every other number starting from the smallest, the program effectively adds the minimum of each pair to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the final score as described in the problem statement.
