### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum possible score by repeatedly choosing pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of the two to the score. To achieve the maximum score, we need to strategically select pairs such that the sum of the minimum values from each pair is maximized.

The given program sorts the list of integers and then adds every second element (starting from the first element) to the score. This strategy works because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements are paired together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sorting**: By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest elements are adjacent.
2. **Pairing**: By selecting every second element from the sorted list, we are effectively pairing the smallest available elements together.
3. **Scoring**: Adding the first element of each pair (which is the smaller element of the pair due to sorting) maximizes the score.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **First Test Case**: `n=1`, List = `[2, 3]`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Score: `2` (choosing `2` and `3` gives `min(2, 3) = 2`)

- **Second Test Case**: `n=2`, List = `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Score: `1 + 1 = 2` (choosing `1` and `1` gives `min(1, 1) = 1`, then `1` and `2` gives `min(1, 2) = 1`)

- **Third Test Case**: `n=3`, List = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (choosing `1` and `1` three times gives `min(1, 1) = 1` each time)

The program correctly implements this strategy and produces the expected results for the given examples.
