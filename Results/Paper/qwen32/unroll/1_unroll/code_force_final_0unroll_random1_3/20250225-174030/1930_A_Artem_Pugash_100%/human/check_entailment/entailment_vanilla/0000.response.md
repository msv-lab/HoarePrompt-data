Reasoning: 
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the smaller number of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy is to always select the smallest available numbers for pairing because this will maximize the number of times the smaller values contribute to the score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
4. The program then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element, which is the smallest) and adds it to the score. This ensures that we are always adding the smaller number of each pair (since the list is sorted).
5. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

This approach is correct because sorting the list and then summing every second element ensures that we are always picking the smallest possible numbers for each pair, which maximizes the score.

Correctness: **True**
