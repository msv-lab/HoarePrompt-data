### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by performing a series of moves where we select two integers from the list, add the smaller of the two to the score, and then remove both integers from the list. This process is repeated exactly `n` times, where `n` is the number of pairs of integers initially on the whiteboard.

The given program follows an optimal strategy to achieve the maximum score. Here are the key points:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list of integers. Sorting ensures that the smallest integers are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the smaller elements in each pair. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and by summing every second element, we are effectively summing the smaller elements of each pair.

2. **Summing Every Second Element**: After sorting, the program sums every second element starting from the first element (index 0). This corresponds to selecting the smaller element from each pair of integers in the sorted list.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through each test case, reading the input values, and processing them independently.

Given this reasoning, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. The annotated state of the program also confirms that it performs the intended operations.
