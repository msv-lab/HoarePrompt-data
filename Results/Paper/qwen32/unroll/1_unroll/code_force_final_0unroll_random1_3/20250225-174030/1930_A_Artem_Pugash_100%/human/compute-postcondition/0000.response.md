In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use in the loop body. 

Here's the loop statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function receives a positive integer. The variable `_` does not need to be initialized before the loop, as it is set by the `range` function during each iteration. The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `t`, which is the number of test cases.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, we can conclude that `t` is already in a valid range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
