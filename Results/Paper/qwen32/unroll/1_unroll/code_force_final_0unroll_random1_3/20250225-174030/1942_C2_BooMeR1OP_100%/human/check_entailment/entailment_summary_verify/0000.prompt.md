You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the given inputs and constraints. The value `ans` is determined by evaluating the gaps between the integers in the list and adjusting it according to the value of `y`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal placement of additional vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Sorting and Indexing**: The program converts the vertices to 0-based indexing but does not handle the circular nature of the polygon properly. For example, if the last vertex is 7 and the first vertex is 1 in an 8-sided polygon, the gap calculation between these two vertices should be 1, but the program might incorrectly calculate it as 6.

2. **Gap Calculation**: The program calculates gaps between consecutive vertices but does not handle the circular nature of the polygon correctly. The gap calculation should consider the shortest distance between any two vertices, considering the polygon's circular nature.

3. **Optimal Placement of Additional Vertices**: The program does not optimally place the additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles. It simply fills the gaps with the available vertices without considering the optimal placement strategy.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the additional vertices can be placed in a way that maximizes the number of triangles. For example, if there are large gaps between vertices, the program should strategically place additional vertices to close these gaps and form more triangles.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

The program might not correctly handle the placement of the additional vertices to form the maximum number of triangles. The program should strategically place the additional vertices to close gaps and form more triangles.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
