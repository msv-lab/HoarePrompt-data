You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: A series of printed values of `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the given inputs and constraints. The value `ans` is determined by evaluating the gaps between the integers in the list and adjusting it according to the value of `y`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular `n`-sided polygon.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`
   - `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)`
   - `0 ≤ y ≤ n - x`
3. **Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`, `x`, `y`: Number of sides, vertices Bessie chose, and additional vertices you can choose.
     - `a`: List of `x` vertices Bessie chose.
4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` vertices `a`.
   - Convert the vertices in `a` to zero-based indexing for easier calculation.
   - Initialize `ans` to `x - 2` (base number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices).
   - Create a set `st` of chosen vertices for quick lookup.
   - Sort the list `a` of chosen vertices.

2. **Counting Triangles with Existing Vertices**:
   - Iterate through each vertex `a[i]` and check if adding a diagonal to `a[i] + 1` or `a[i] + 2` (modulo `n`) forms a new triangle.
   - If `a[i] + 1` is not in `st` and `a[i] + 2` is in `st`, increment `ans` by 1.

3. **Calculating Gaps**:
   - Calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices in `a`.
   - Separate these gaps into `odd` and `even` lists based on their parity.

4. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices**:
   - Sort the `odd` and `even` gaps.
   - For each gap in `odd`:
     - If `y` is less than half of the gap, add `2 * y` to `ans` and set `y` to 0, then break.
     - Otherwise, add the full gap to `ans` and reduce `y` by half of the gap.
   - Repeat the same process for each gap in `even`.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the maximum number of triangles `ans` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Large `n`**:
   - The code uses modulo operations and maintains a set of chosen vertices, which is efficient.
   - However, the algorithm's complexity is primarily determined by the number of chosen vertices `x` and the number of gaps, which are manageable within the constraints.

2. **Correctness of Triangle Counting**:
   - The logic for counting triangles with existing vertices is correct.
   - The logic for maximizing triangles with additional vertices seems to follow the problem's requirements, but it needs careful verification.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles cases where `y` is 0 by not adding any additional vertices.
   - It correctly processes gaps between consecutive vertices and uses additional vertices optimally.

### Conclusion:
After a thorough analysis, the provided code appears to correctly solve the problem by efficiently counting and maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

**Correctness: True**
