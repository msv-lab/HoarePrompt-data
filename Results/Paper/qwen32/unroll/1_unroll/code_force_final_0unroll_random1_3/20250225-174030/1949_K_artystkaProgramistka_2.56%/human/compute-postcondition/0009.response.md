Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n` (an integer representing the total number of integers), `na` (an integer representing the size of group A), `nb` (an integer representing the size of group B), `nc` (an integer representing the size of group C), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). The function returns 'YES', `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` if the numbers in `numbers` can be split into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively, such that the sums of these groups satisfy the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` which is true. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
