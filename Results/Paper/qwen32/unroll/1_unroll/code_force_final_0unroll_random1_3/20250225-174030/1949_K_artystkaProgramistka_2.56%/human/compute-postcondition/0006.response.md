Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c. Here, 'YES' is a string, group_a is a list containing the first `na` numbers from `numbers`, group_b is a list containing the next `nb` numbers from `numbers`, and group_c is a list containing the last `nc` numbers from `numbers`. The sum of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c satisfy the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` which is true.**
