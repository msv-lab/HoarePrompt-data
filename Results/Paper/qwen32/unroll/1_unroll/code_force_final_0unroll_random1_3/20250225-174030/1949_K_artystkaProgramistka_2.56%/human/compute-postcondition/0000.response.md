Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the total number of integers, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.**

The list `numbers` has been sorted in descending order, while the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged.
