Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here is a breakdown of the program's logic and how it addresses the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`. It then reads the lists `a` and `b`, which represent the positions of signs and the corresponding times the car arrives at those positions, respectively.
   - It also initializes helper lists `ad`, `bd`, and `v` to store the differences in positions, differences in times, and speeds between each pair of consecutive signs.

2. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the speed `v` between each pair of consecutive signs using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`, where `ad[i]` is the distance between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` signs, and `bd[i]` is the time difference.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `d`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the position of the largest sign that is less than or equal to `d`.
   - If `d` exactly matches a sign, the program outputs the corresponding time from `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `d` by considering the time taken to reach the previous sign and the additional time to travel from the previous sign to `d` at the calculated speed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints described in the problem statement. It efficiently processes up to 10^4 test cases, each with up to 10^5 queries and up to 10^5 points, within the given limits. Therefore, the program is correct.
