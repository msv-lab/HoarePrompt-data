You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves determining the maximum number of wins the cow at position `k` can achieve, given the option to swap it with another cow once. The cow wins a match if its Cowdeforces rating is higher than its opponent's. The matches proceed sequentially, with the winner of each match advancing to the next round.

### Program Analysis:
The program aims to solve this problem by considering two scenarios:
1. **No Swap**: The cow at position `k` does not swap positions.
2. **Swap**: The cow at position `k` swaps with another cow to maximize its wins.

#### No Swap Scenario:
- The cow at position `k` is placed at the start of the list.
- The program then simulates the matches from the beginning.
- It counts how many matches the cow at position `k` wins consecutively.

#### Swap Scenario:
- The program considers swapping the cow at position `k` with the cow that the cow at position `k` would face if it did not swap.
- It simulates the matches again with this new arrangement.
- It counts how many matches the cow at position `k` wins consecutively in this new arrangement.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **No Swap Logic**:
   - The program swaps the cow at position `k` with the cow at position 1 (index 0).
   - It then simulates the matches starting from the new position of the cow at `k`.
   - This logic is incorrect because the cow at `k` should not be moved to position 1; it should stay at its original position and simulate the matches from there.

2. **Swap Logic**:
   - The program swaps the cow at position `k` with the cow that it would face if it did not swap.
   - It then simulates the matches with this new arrangement.
   - The logic for counting wins post-swap is also incorrect. The program does not correctly identify the opponent the cow at `k` would face after the swap.

3. **General Approach**:
   - The program does not consider all possible positions to swap the cow at `k` to maximize wins.
   - It only considers a single swap position, which may not yield the maximum number of wins.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly determine the maximum number of wins the cow at position `k` can achieve with an optimal swap or no swap.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
