You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem description. Specifically, the program only considers two scenarios for the optimal swap: swapping the cow with the cow in the first position and swapping the cow with the cow in the position right after the last cow that the cow in the first position could beat. However, there might be other positions where swapping would yield a better result.

Let's break down the logic of the program and identify the issue:

1. **Initial Swap with Position 1**:
   - The program swaps the cow at position `k` with the cow at position `1` and calculates the number of wins for the cow at position `k`.
   - It then swaps them back to their original positions.

2. **Swap with the Position Right After the Last Cow Beat by the Cow in Position 1**:
   - The program finds the last cow that the cow in position `1` can beat.
   - It then swaps the cow at position `k` with this cow and calculates the number of wins for the cow at position `k`.

However, the program does not consider other potential positions to swap with that might yield a higher number of wins for the cow at position `k`. For example, the cow at position `k` might have a higher rating than the cow in position `1` and could potentially beat more cows if swapped with a different cow in a strategic position.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample**:
```
Input:
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 5

Output:
Expected: 3
Actual: 2
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample**:
- Initially, the cows are in the order: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 5]`.
- The cow at position `3` (with rating `30`) is initially in the middle.
- If we swap the cow at position `3` with the cow at position `1`, the order becomes `[30, 20, 10, 40, 5]`:
  - The cow at position `1` (with rating `30`) beats the cow at position `2` (with rating `20`).
  - The cow at position `1` (with rating `30`) beats the cow at position `3` (with rating `10`).
  - The cow at position `1` (with rating `30`) loses to the cow at position `4` (with rating `40`).
  - Total wins for the cow at position `3` (originally with rating `30`): `2`.
- If we swap the cow at position `3` with the cow at position `4`, the order becomes `[10, 20, 40, 30, 5]`:
  - The cow at position `1` (with rating `10`) beats the cow at position `2` (with rating `20`).
  - The cow at position `1` (with rating `10`) loses to the cow at position `3` (with rating `40`).
  - The cow at position `3` (with rating `40`) beats the cow at position `4` (with rating `30`).
  - The cow at position `3` (with rating `40`) beats the cow at position `5` (with rating `5`).
  - Total wins for the cow at position `3` (originally with rating `30`): `3`.

In this case, the optimal swap is not considered by the program, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases for the optimal swap.
