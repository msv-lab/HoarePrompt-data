You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Maximize the number of wins for cow `k` in a coding tournament.
- **Tournament Rules:** 
  - The first match is between cows at positions 1 and 2.
  - Subsequent matches are between the winner of the previous match and the cow in the next position.
  - The cow with the higher rating wins.
  - You can swap cow `k` with another cow once or do nothing.
- **Input:** 
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`.
  - The ratings of the cows.
- **Output:** 
  - The maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem by considering two scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1:** Swapping cow `k` with cow at position 1 and then simulating the tournament.
2. **Scenario 2:** Swapping cow `k` with the cow that beats cow `k` in the initial simulation (if possible) and then simulating the tournament.

Let's break down the key parts of the code:

1. **Initial Swap and Simulation:**
   - The program swaps cow `k` with cow at position 1.
   - It then simulates the tournament to count the number of wins for cow `k`.
   - The variable `ans` stores the number of wins in this scenario.
   - The program then swaps cow `k` back to its original position.

2. **Second Swap and Simulation:**
   - The program identifies the position `p` where cow `k` loses in the first simulation.
   - It then swaps cow `k` with the cow at position `p`.
   - It simulates the tournament again to count the number of wins for cow `k`.
   - The variable `ans1` stores the number of wins in this scenario.
   - The program then prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Scenario 1:**
   - After the first swap, the program correctly simulates the tournament and counts the wins.
   - However, the swap back to the original position is unnecessary and does not affect the subsequent logic.

2. **Scenario 2:**
   - The program identifies the position `p` where cow `k` loses in the first simulation.
   - It then swaps cow `k` with the cow at position `p`.
   - The simulation logic is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where cow `k` is swapped into a position where it can win more matches.
   - The logic for counting wins in the second scenario is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the tournament after the swap.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the second scenario, the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of wins for cow `k`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
