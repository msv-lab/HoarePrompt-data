You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

            else:
                ans += 1
        p = j

                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        print(max(ans, ans1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it performs specific swaps and calculations to determine the longest non-increasing subsequence starting from the first element after the swaps. It outputs the maximum value between two calculated results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only considers two scenarios for swapping: swapping the cow with the first cow and swapping the cow with the cow that would have been the winner of the previous match (if it exists). This approach does not account for all possible beneficial swaps that could maximize the number of wins for the cow.

Let's analyze the code and identify a potential issue:
1. The code swaps the cow with the first cow and calculates the number of wins.
2. It then swaps the cow with the winner of the previous match (if it exists) and calculates the number of wins.
3. The maximum of these two scenarios is printed as the result.

However, the optimal swap might not necessarily be with the first cow or the winner of the previous match. The cow could potentially benefit from swapping with any cow that is weaker than it and positioned in a way that maximizes the number of subsequent wins.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6 4
1 2 3 10 4 5
```
In this case, the cow with rating 10 (at position 4) could benefit from swapping with the cow with rating 2 (at position 2). After the swap, the sequence would be `1 10 3 2 4 5`, and the cow with rating 10 could win all subsequent matches, achieving a total of 4 wins.

The provided program would not consider this optimal swap and would likely output a lower number of wins.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not explore all possible beneficial swaps to determine the maximum number of wins for the cow.
