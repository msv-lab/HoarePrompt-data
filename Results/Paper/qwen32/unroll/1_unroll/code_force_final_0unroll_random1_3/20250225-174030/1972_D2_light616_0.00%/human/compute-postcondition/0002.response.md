The code provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6, and that `x` is 1 and `cnt` is 0. Since the code snippet updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the input, the new values of `n` and `m` will be the integers provided by the input. The values of `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers provided by the input, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0.**
