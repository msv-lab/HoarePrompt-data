### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the program's logic to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves starting from no cubes.

1. **If `m > n`**: It's impossible because each move can add at most 1 cube.
2. **If `n == m`**: It's possible because Nikita can simply add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves.
3. **If `m == n - 1`**: It's possible because Nikita can add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves except for one move where he removes a cube.
4. **If `m < n - 1`**: It's possible as long as the net addition is `m` cubes. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, Nikita can add 1 cube 3 times and remove 1 cube 2 times.

The key point here is that as long as `m` is reachable by a combination of additions and removals that totals `m` cubes, it should be possible. The parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` does not directly determine the possibility unless `m` is `n-1` or `m > n`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program's logic is as follows:
- It checks if `n == m` and prints "Yes" if true.
- It checks if `m > n` and prints "No" if true.
- It checks if `m == n - 1` and prints "Yes" if true.
- It then checks if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd and prints "Yes" if true.
- Otherwise, it prints "No".

The last two conditions (`m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`) are incorrect because they do not account for all valid cases where `m < n - 1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the program will print "No" because `m` and `n` have different parities, but it is actually possible (add 1 cube 3 times and remove 1 cube 2 times).

The original assessment correctly identifies this issue and concludes that the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program incorrectly handles cases where `m < n - 1` based on the parity of `m` and `n`.

**Final: False**
