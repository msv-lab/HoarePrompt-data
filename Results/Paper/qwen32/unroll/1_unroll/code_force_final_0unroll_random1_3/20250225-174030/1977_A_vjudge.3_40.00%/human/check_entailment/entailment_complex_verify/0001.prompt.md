You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After executing the loop for all `t` test cases, the program will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each pair of integers `n` and `m` based on the given conditions. The state of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables from the initial state are affected.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions. The conditions are: print 'Yes' if `n` equals `m`, if `m` is exactly one less than `n`, or if both `n` and `m` are either even or odd. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify `t` or any other input variables beyond using them to determine the output for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves starting from no cubes.

Here are the possible scenarios:
1. **If `m > n`**: It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves because each move can add at most 1 cube.
2. **If `n == m`**: It's possible to have exactly `m` cubes, as Nikita can simply add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves.
3. **If `m == n - 1`**: It's possible to have exactly `m` cubes. Nikita can add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves except for one move where he removes a cube.
4. **If `m < n - 1`**: It's also possible to have exactly `m` cubes. Nikita can add cubes for some moves and remove cubes for others, as long as the net addition is `m` cubes. The parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` does not directly determine the possibility unless `m` is `n-1` or `m > n`.

Let's review the program's logic:
- It checks if `n == m` and prints "Yes" if true.
- It checks if `m > n` and prints "No" if true.
- It checks if `m == n - 1` and prints "Yes" if true.
- It then checks if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd and prints "Yes" if true.
- Otherwise, it prints "No".

The last two conditions (`m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`) are incorrect because they don't account for all valid cases where `m < n - 1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the program will print "No" because `m` and `n` have different parities, but it is actually possible (add 1 cube 3 times and remove 1 cube 2 times).

Thus, the program is incorrect due to these conditions.

Correctness: **False**
