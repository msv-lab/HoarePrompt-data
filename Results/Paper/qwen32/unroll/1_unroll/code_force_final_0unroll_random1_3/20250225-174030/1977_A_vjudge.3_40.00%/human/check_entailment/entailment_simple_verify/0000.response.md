### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the provided annotations and original assessment.

**Problem Understanding:**
- Nikita starts with 0 cubes.
- In each move, he can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- We need to determine if, after `n` moves, it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes.

**Key Insight:**
- The difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move changes the cube count by 1.
- Therefore, `n - m` must be even, which is equivalent to `n % 2 == m % 2`.

**Program Analysis:**

Here is the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

**Annotations:**
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call and the loop.

**Original Assessment:**
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it mentions that the condition `m == n - 1` is incorrect and that the parity condition should be checked instead.

**Evaluation Using Annotations:**

Let's analyze the conditions in the program:

1. **Condition: `if n == m`**
   - This is correct. If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible to have `m` cubes by adding one cube per move.

2. **Condition: `elif m > n`**
   - This is correct. If the number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because each move can add at most one cube.

3. **Condition: `elif m == n - 1`**
   - This condition is incorrect. It does not account for the parity of `n` and `m`. The correct condition should be based on the parity of `n` and `m`.

4. **Condition: `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`**
   - This is correct for ensuring that the difference `n - m` is even.

5. **Condition: `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`**
   - This is also correct for ensuring that the difference `n - m` is even.

6. **Else Condition:**
   - This is correct. If none of the above conditions are met, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Counterexample:**
- Input: `1 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add a cube and then remove it to end up with 1 cube).
  - Program Output: `No` (because it does not correctly handle the parity condition).

**Conclusion:**
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly handle all cases due to the incorrect condition `m == n - 1`. The correct condition should be based on the parity of `n` and `m`.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **False**
