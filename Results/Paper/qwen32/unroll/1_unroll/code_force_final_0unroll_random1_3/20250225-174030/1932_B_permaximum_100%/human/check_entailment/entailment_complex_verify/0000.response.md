Let's carefully analyze the provided program, the problem description, and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. Specifically:
- The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- The (i+1)-th sign can only occur after the i-th sign has occurred.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of:
- An integer `n` representing the number of signs.
- A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the periodicity of each sign.

The program then calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case using the following logic:
- Initialize `current_year` to 0.
- For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
  - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be at `current_year + ai`.
  - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be at the next multiple of `ai`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
- Update `current_year` to `next_year` after each sign's occurrence.
- The final `current_year` after processing all signs is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- After processing each test case, `results` is a list of integers representing the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

### Evaluation
The logic in the program is correct. Here's why:
1. **Initialization**: `current_year` is initialized to 0, which is the starting year.
2. **Calculation of Next Occurrence**:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is the next multiple of `ai`, calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
3. **Sequential Occurrence**: The program correctly updates `current_year` to `next_year` after each sign's occurrence, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when all periodicities are 1 (all signs occur every year) and when periodicities are larger numbers.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of periodicities and calculates the year in which each sign will occur sequentially. The logic for determining the next occurrence of each sign is accurate and handles all edge cases.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
