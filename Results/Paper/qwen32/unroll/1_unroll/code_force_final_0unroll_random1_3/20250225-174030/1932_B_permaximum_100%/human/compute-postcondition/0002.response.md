The given code processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a number `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of each integer in the list, in sequence. The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. The outer loop iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
2. For each test case, `n` and the list `a` of integers are extracted.
3. `current_year` is initialized to 0.
4. The inner loop iterates over each integer `ai` in the list `a`.
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year (`next_year`) is simply `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, `next_year` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
   - `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.
5. After processing all integers in the list `a`, the final `current_year` for that test case is appended to the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6 for each `i`; `results` is a list of `t` integers where each integer is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case's list.**
