Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. The program attempts to count the number of distinct subsequences of length `k` in `s` by using bit manipulation, but this is not the correct approach to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`.

2. The program does not correctly generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` when the answer is "NO". The logic for generating such a string is flawed.

3. The program does not correctly handle the requirement to check for all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

A correct solution would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checking if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings is not a subsequence, the program should output "NO" followed by that string. If all are subsequences, the program should output "YES".

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If all generated strings are subsequences, print "YES".
4. If any generated string is not a subsequence, print "NO" followed by that string.

Given the constraints, a brute-force approach of generating all possible strings of length `n` (which can be up to `26^n` strings) might be computationally expensive. A more efficient approach would be to use a dynamic programming or bitmasking technique to check for subsequences, but the provided program does not implement this correctly.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect.
