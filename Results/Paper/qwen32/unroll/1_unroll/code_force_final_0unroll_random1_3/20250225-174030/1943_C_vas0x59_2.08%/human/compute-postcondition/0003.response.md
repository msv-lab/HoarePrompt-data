To understand the output state, let's break down what the loop does. The loop runs `n-1` times, and in each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `u` and `v`, decrements each by 1, and appends each to the other's corresponding list in `u2vs`.

Given that `u2vs` is initially a list of `n` empty lists, after the loop, each pair `(u, v)` will create a bidirectional connection between the two indices in the `u2vs` list. Essentially, `u2vs` will represent an adjacency list of an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to the node corresponding to the index of the inner list.**
