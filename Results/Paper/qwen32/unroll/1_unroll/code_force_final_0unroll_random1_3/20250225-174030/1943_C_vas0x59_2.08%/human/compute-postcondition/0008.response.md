Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to the node corresponding to the index of the inner list; `d` is the list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes as returned by `bfs(a)`; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list returned by `bfs(a)` indicating the previous node for each node in the shortest path from node `0`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
