To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic used in `func_1` and see if it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program:
- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function determines the winner based on the sum of coins in both wallets.
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - It reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
  - It calls `func_1` to determine the winner and appends the result.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification of the Logic:
- The key insight here is that the game is essentially determined by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
  - If the total number of coins is even, the first player (Alice) can always be forced into a losing position if both play optimally.
  - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position.

### Detailed Reasoning:
Let's analyze the reasoning behind the parity rule:
- **Even Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is even, no matter what Alice does, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. Since the total is even, Bob will always be the one to make the last move, forcing Alice into a losing position.
- **Odd Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that Bob is left with an even number of coins after her first move. By doing so, Alice can force Bob into a position where he will always be left with an even number of coins, ensuring that Alice makes the last move and wins.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in `func_1` is correct based on the problem analysis. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: True**
