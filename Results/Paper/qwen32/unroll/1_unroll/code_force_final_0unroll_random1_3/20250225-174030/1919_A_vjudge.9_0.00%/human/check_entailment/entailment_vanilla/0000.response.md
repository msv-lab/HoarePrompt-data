To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic used in `func_1` and see if it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Dynamics**: 
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program:
- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function determines the winner based on the sum of coins in both wallets.
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - It reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
  - It calls `func_1` to determine the winner and appends the result.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification of the Logic:
- The key insight here is that the game is essentially determined by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
  - If the total number of coins is even, the first player (Alice) can always be forced into a losing position if both play optimally.
  - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in `func_1` is correct based on the problem analysis. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
