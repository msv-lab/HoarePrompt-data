t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, followed by an n x n grid where each cell contains either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's in the grid with the size of the shape greater than 1.
