You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n × n` grid of '0's and '1's. It then determines whether the grid contains exactly one square or one triangle made up entirely of '1's and outputs "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" accordingly. The values of `t`, `n`, and the grid remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the specific patterns required for triangles and squares as described in the problem statement.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Squares**: The program checks if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's. While this is true for squares, it does not guarantee that the entire shape is a square. The program does not check if all rows with '1's have the same number of '1's and if the '1's are positioned at equal distances from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Triangles**: The program does not check for the pattern of a triangle. A triangle has rows with an increasing (or decreasing) number of '1's, centered around a central column. The program does not verify this pattern.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```
In this case, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because the first two rows with '1's have different counts of '1's (1 and 2, respectively), but the shape is actually a triangle.

Another example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0001
0011
0111
1111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```
Again, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because the first two rows with '1's have different counts of '1's (1 and 2, respectively), but the shape is actually a triangle.

The program needs to be more sophisticated to correctly identify the shape based on the patterns described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
