Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n Ã— n` grid of '0's and '1's. It then determines whether the grid contains exactly one square or one triangle made up entirely of '1's and outputs "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" accordingly. The values of `t`, `n`, and the grid remain unchanged.**
