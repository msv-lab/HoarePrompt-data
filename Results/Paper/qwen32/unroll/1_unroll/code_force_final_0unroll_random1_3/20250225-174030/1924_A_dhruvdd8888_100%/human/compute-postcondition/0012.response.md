In the given task, the loop is defined as:

```python
for i in us:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `us`. The variable `i` is the loop variable that takes on the values of the elements in `us` during each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state of `us` determines whether the loop will execute.

Given the state before the loop starts is `ps` is less than `n`, this state does not affect the execution of the loop directly since `ps` and `n` are not part of the loop head. To ensure the loop executes, `us` must be an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) with at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `us` during the first iteration.

Thus, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `us` must have at least one element.

State: **`ps` is less than `n`, `us` is an iterable with at least one element**
