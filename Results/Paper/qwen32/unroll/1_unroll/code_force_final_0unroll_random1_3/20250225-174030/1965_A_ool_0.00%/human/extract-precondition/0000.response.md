Precondition: **arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
