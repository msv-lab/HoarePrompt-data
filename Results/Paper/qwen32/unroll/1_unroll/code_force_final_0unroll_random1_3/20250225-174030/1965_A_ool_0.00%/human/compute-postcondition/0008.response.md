To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates over the sorted unique elements of `arr` (stored in `set_`) starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element. For each iteration, it checks if the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1. If this condition is met, `not_c` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, it toggles the value of `A` (i.e., if `A` is `True`, it becomes `False`, and vice versa).

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9).
- `A` is `False`.
- `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` in ascending order.
- `not_c` is `True`.

The loop modifies `A` and `not_c` based on the differences between consecutive elements in `set_`.

### Output State Analysis:
- **`A`**: The value of `A` will toggle with each iteration if the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] <= 1` is met. The final value of `A` will depend on the number of iterations where this condition is met. If the number of such iterations is even, `A` will remain `False`; if it is odd, `A` will become `True`.
- **`not_c`**: If any pair of consecutive elements in `set_` has a difference greater than 1, `not_c` will be set to `False` and the loop will terminate early. If all differences are 1 or less, `not_c` will remain `True`.

### Output State:
The output state will depend on the specific values in `set_`. However, we can describe the general output state in terms of `A` and `not_c`:

- If there is any pair of consecutive elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1, `not_c` will be `False`, and the value of `A` will be the value it had after the last iteration where the difference was 1 or less.
- If all consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference of 1 or less, `not_c` will remain `True`, and the value of `A` will be `True` if the number of iterations (where the difference was 1 or less) is odd, and `False` if it is even.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`A` is either `True` or `False` depending on the number of iterations where the difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is 1 or less, and `not_c` is `False` if any difference is greater than 1, otherwise `True`.**
