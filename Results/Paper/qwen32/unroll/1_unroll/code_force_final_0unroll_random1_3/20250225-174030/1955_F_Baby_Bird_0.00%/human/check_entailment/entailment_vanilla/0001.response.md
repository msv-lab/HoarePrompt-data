Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

**Objective:** Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally from a sequence of integers, where Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero, and Bob wins otherwise.

**Key Points:**
- The sequence consists of integers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Eve removes one number in each round.
- Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
- Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins.

**Winning Conditions:**
- XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each bit position in the binary representation of the numbers is even.
- For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
  - 1: `01`
  - 2: `10`
  - 3: `11`
  - 4: `100`
- XOR of the sequence is zero if:
  - The count of numbers with the least significant bit set (1, 3) is even.
  - The count of numbers with the second least significant bit set (2, 3, 4) is even.
  - The count of numbers with the third least significant bit set (4) is even.

**Strategy:**
- Eve should aim to maintain an even count for each bit position to ensure Bob wins.
- The optimal strategy involves removing numbers in such a way that the parity of the counts of numbers with specific bits remains even.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Processing Counts:**
   - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`:
     - This line attempts to adjust the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
     - The lambda function `lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2` effectively rounds down each count to the nearest even number.
     - This operation does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

3. **Determine Bob's Wins:**
   - `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)`:
     - The first part `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s have an odd parity.
     - If all three counts are odd, this part evaluates to `1`; otherwise, it evaluates to `0`.
     - The second part `sum(p) // 2` calculates the total number of numbers removed, divided by 2.
     - The sum of these two parts is printed as the result.

### Correctness Evaluation

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize Bob's wins. The logic for adjusting counts and determining the number of wins is flawed.

**Issues:**
- The operation to adjust counts to even numbers does not align with the optimal strategy.
- The logic to calculate Bob's wins is incorrect and does not consider the binary representation of numbers properly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
