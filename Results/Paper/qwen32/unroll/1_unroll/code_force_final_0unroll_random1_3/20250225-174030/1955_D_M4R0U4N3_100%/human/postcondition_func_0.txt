The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`, and two integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that also appear in list `b`. The result for each test case is printed, indicating the count of such subarrays.
