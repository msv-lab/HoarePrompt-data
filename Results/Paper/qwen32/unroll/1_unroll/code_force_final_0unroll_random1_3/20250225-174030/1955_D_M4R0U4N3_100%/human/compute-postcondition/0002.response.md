In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a common convention in Python for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, which means it depends on the user input. However, since we are tasked with adjusting the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input provided to the loop will allow it to execute.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The only variable that needs to be adjusted is the input to the `range` function, which is `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be at least 1.
3. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to the loop is at least 1.

Since the state before the loop starts includes `t` (the number of test cases), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `max_val`, and `cnt_b` are not directly related to the execution of the for loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
