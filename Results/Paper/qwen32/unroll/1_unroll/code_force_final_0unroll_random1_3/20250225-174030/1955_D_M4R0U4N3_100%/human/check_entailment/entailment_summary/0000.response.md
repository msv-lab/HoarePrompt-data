Reasoning:
The program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window technique combined with frequency counting. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt_b` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each element in array `b`.
   - `b_values` is a set of elements in `b` for quick lookup.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It counts the frequency of each element in `b` using `cnt_b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program first checks the initial window of length `m` in `a` to see how many elements in this window match elements in `b` (i.e., they are present in `b_values` and their frequency in the window does not exceed their frequency in `b`).
   - If the number of matching elements in the initial window is at least `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.
   - It then slides the window one element at a time from the start of `a` to the end:
     - It adjusts the frequency count by adding back the element that is sliding out of the window and subtracting the element that is sliding into the window.
     - It updates the count of matching elements in the window.
     - If the updated count of matching elements is at least `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows for the current test case, it prints the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting for Next Test Case**:
   - Before processing the next test case, it resets the count of elements in `cnt_b` that were part of `b_values` to zero.

The program efficiently uses a sliding window and frequency counting to determine the number of good subarrays, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.
