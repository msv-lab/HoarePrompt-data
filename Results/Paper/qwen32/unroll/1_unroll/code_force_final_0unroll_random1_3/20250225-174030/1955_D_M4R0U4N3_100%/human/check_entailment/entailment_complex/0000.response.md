### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window technique. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000 to accommodate the maximum possible value of elements in `a` and `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is an array of size `max_val + 1` initialized to zero. This array will keep track of the count of each element in `b`.

2. **Reading Input and Preprocessing**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   - Arrays `a` and `b` are read.
   - The count of each element in `b` is stored in `cnt_b`.

3. **Processing the First Window**:
   - A set `b_values` is created from `b` to quickly check if an element is in `b`.
   - The first window of size `m` in `a` is processed. For each element in this window, if it is in `b`, the count in `cnt_b` is decremented, and `curr` (the count of matching elements in the current window) is incremented.
   - If `curr` (the number of matching elements in the current window) is at least `k`, `ans` (the count of good subarrays) is incremented.

4. **Sliding the Window**:
   - The window slides from left to right across `a`. For each new position:
     - The element that is sliding out of the window is checked. If it was in `b` and its count in `cnt_b` was positive, `curr` is decremented.
     - The element that is sliding into the window is checked. If it is in `b`, the count in `cnt_b` is decremented, and `curr` is incremented.
     - If `curr` is at least `k`, `ans` is incremented.
   
5. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows for a test case, the result `ans` is printed.
   - `cnt_b` is reset to zero for the next test case.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program is correct. It efficiently counts the number of good subarrays using a sliding window approach, which ensures that each element is processed at most twice (once when entering and once when leaving the window). This approach is optimal given the constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
