Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be an integer input by the user, which is within the range of 1 to 1000. The other variables (`n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
