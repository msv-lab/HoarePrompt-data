### Reasoning:
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful, where a string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The provided program calculates the total number of occurrences of these substrings in the string and prints this count for each test case.

However, the program does not actually determine the minimum number of characters to remove. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie". Removing the occurrences of these substrings is not as straightforward as just counting them, because characters can be part of multiple occurrences of the substrings, and removing characters from one occurrence might affect another.

For example, consider the string "mapie". The program would count 1 "map" and 1 "pie", totaling 2. However, to make the string beautiful, we only need to remove 2 characters (e.g., "m" and "p" from "map", or "p" and "e" from "pie"), not 4 (which would be the case if we removed all characters from both substrings independently).

Thus, the program's logic is incorrect for the problem as described.
