Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, x and y have the same length for each test case.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: For each test case, two strings of the same length as the input strings x and y are printed, where the first differing digit positions have the maximum and minimum of x and y assigned to new and new2 respectively, and all subsequent digits have the minimum and maximum of x and y assigned to new and new2 respectively. This process is repeated t times for t test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, composed only of digits from 1 to 9. For each test case, it generates two new numbers: one where the digits are the maximum of the corresponding digits in `x` and `y` up to the first differing position, followed by the minimum of the remaining digits, and another where the digits are the minimum of the corresponding digits in `x` and `y` up to the first differing position, followed by the maximum of the remaining digits. It prints these two numbers for each test case.
