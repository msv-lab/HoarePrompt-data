You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.

    #State: For each test case, two strings of the same length as the input strings x and y are printed, where the first differing digit positions have the maximum and minimum of x and y assigned to new and new2 respectively, and all subsequent digits have the minimum and maximum of x and y assigned to new and new2 respectively. This process is repeated t times for t test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly maximizes the product of the two numbers `x` and `y` by swapping their corresponding digits.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to maximize the product of two numbers `x` and `y` by swapping their digits at the same positions. The digits in `x` and `y` range from 1 to 9, and the numbers can be up to 100 digits long.

### Program Explanation
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` and converts them into lists of integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Two new lists `new` and `new2` are initialized to store the digits of the modified `x` and `y` respectively.

3. **Processing**:
   - The program iterates through the digits of `a` and `b`.
   - For each position `i` where the digits of `a` and `b` are equal, it assigns the same digit to both `new` and `new2`.
   - When it encounters a position where the digits are different, it starts a strategy to maximize the product:
     - It assigns the larger digit to `new` and the smaller digit to `new2` for the first differing position.
     - For all subsequent positions, it assigns the smaller digit to `new` and the larger digit to `new2`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all digits, the program prints the modified numbers `new` and `new2`.

### Correctness Analysis
The strategy used by the program is not optimal for maximizing the product of `x` and `y`. The approach of assigning the larger digit to one number and the smaller digit to the other starting from the first differing position is not guaranteed to yield the maximum product. For instance, consider the following counterexample:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  999
  111
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  999
  111
  ```
  (or any permutation that results in a higher product, such as `911` and `199`, but `999` and `111` is a valid and optimal output)

- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  911
  199
  ```
  (or another permutation, but the logic will not necessarily yield `999` and `111`)

The program does not consider all possible permutations of digits, and it does not guarantee that the resulting product is the maximum possible.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` for all possible inputs.
