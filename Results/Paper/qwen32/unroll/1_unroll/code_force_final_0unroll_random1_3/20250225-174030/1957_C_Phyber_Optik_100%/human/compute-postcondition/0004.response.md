Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard. It returns the result based on the number of moves `k` and the positions of the moves provided. Specifically, if any two moves share the same row or column, it returns "INVALID"; otherwise, it returns "VALID".**
