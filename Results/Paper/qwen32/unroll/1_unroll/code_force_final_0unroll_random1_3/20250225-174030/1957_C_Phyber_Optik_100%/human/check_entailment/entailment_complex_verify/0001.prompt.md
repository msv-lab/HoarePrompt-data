You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of moves already played (0 ≤ k ≤ n). The function is called once for each test case, and for each test case, there are k lines of input, each containing two integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing the i-th move made. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    dp[2] = 3

        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of moves already played (0 ≤ k ≤ n), `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for i from 3 to n is computed as (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard. It calculates and returns a value based on a dynamic programming approach, specifically the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard modulo 1000000007. The function does not consider any moves `k` or their positions as described in the annotations, as these are not part of the function's actual implementation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it aligns with the problem description and requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes a list `dp` with a size of 300007 and precomputes values up to index 300000 using the `func_1` function.
   - The `dp` array is supposed to hold the number of possible final configurations for a given board size `n` after all valid moves are made.
   - The `func_1` function calculates the values using the recurrence relation:
     - `dp[1] = 1`
     - `dp[2] = 3`
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for `i >= 3`

2. **Reading Input and Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of already occupied rows and columns.
   - The number of remaining valid moves is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The program prints the value from the `dp` array at the index `n - len(invalid)` to determine the number of possible final configurations.

### Verification of the Approach:

- **Recurrence Relation**:
  - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks attack each other.
  - The relation accounts for placing a rook in a new row/column and the subsequent valid configurations that can be formed.

- **Handling of Invalid Moves**:
  - The program correctly identifies and excludes already occupied rows and columns by adding them to the `invalid` set.
  - It calculates the number of remaining valid positions as `n - len(invalid)`.

- **Output**:
  - The program outputs the number of possible final configurations from the `dp` array, which has been precomputed for all possible board sizes up to 300000.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It precomputes the number of possible configurations for different board sizes and uses this precomputed data to efficiently solve each test case. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.
