a is a list containing multiple test cases, where each test case is represented as a list. Each test case list starts with two integers n and k, followed by n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. Here, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is the number of test cases, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 is the number of cows, 1 ≤ k ≤ n is the index of the cow owned by the user, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 are the distinct Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
