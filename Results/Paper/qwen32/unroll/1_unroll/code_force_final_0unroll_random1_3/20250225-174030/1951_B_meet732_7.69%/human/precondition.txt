a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, k, ratings) representing the number of cows, the index of the cow you own, and a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows respectively. The number of test cases t is determined by the length of the list a. For each test case, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
