Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.**

Given that `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1, `ind` must have exactly two elements. Since `ind[0]` is 0, `ind[1]` is the second index, which is greater than 0. The value of `k` is either 14 or remains unchanged, but it does not affect the output unless it is specifically 14. Therefore, the program returns the smaller of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
