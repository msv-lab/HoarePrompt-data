Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x` with the current length of `ind` being 1, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list. The first element of `ind` is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.**
