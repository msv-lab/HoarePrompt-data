Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x` with the current length of `ind` being 1, `ind[0]` is 0, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `ind` is not an empty list. If `k` is 14, then `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.**
