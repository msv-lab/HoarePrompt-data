### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by first reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually. For each test case, the program checks if the string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking Distinct Characters:**
   - It converts the string `s` into a set `a` to determine the number of distinct characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` (i.e., the number of distinct characters) is 2, it prints "NO" because any rearrangement of a string with exactly two distinct characters will always result in the same string (e.g., "aaabbb" can only be rearranged to "aababb", "ababab", etc., which are permutations of the same pattern).

3. **Generating a New String:**
   - If the string has more than two distinct characters, it prints "YES".
   - It then creates two sorted versions of the string: `b` (lexicographically smallest) and `c` (lexicographically largest).
   - If the original string `s` is already the lexicographically smallest version (`b`), it prints the lexicographically largest version (`c`).
   - Otherwise, it prints the lexicographically smallest version (`b`).

### Analysis:

- The logic of checking the number of distinct characters is correct. If a string has only two distinct characters, it is impossible to rearrange it into a different string.
- The approach of generating the lexicographically smallest and largest versions of the string and then choosing one that is different from the original is a valid strategy to ensure the new string is different from the original.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the given test cases as per the provided example output.

Correctness: **True**
