Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, `m` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been updated to an integer value read from the input, which is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. All other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m`) remain as described in the initial state, with their values to be determined in subsequent code execution.
