Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers, `k` is an integer, `t` is an integer, `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length m in `a` that have at least `k` matches with `b`, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the last window `a[n-m:n]`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements in the last window `a[n-m:n]` that also exist in `b_freq`. The current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
