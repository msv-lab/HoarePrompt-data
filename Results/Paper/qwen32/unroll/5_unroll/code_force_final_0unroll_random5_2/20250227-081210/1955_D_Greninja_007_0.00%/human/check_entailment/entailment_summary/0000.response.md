### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the approach and verify if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the length of array `a`, the length of array `b`, and the minimum number of matching elements required, respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - `b_freq` is a `Counter` object that stores the frequency of each element in `b`.
   - `window_freq` is a `Counter` object that stores the frequency of elements in the current window of length `m` in `a`.

3. **Initial Match Count**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of matching elements between the first window (first `m` elements of `a`) and `b` using the `matches` variable.
   - This is done by iterating over the keys in `window_freq` and summing up the minimum of the counts of each element in `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

4. **Sliding the Window**:
   - The program slides the window one element at a time from the start to the end of `a`.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - It checks if the current window has at least `k` matches with `b`. If so, it increments the `good_subarrays` counter.
     - It updates the `matches` count by removing the contribution of the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the contribution of the new element that is sliding into the window.
     - It updates the `window_freq` counter accordingly.

5. **Final Match Check**:
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check to see if the last window has at least `k` matches with `b` and increments `good_subarrays` if true.

6. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the count of good subarrays.

### Verification:

- The sliding window technique is efficient and well-suited for this problem, as it avoids recalculating the count of matching elements from scratch for each subarray.
- The use of `Counter` objects ensures that the program efficiently keeps track of the frequency of elements in `b` and the current window of `a`.
- The program correctly handles the sliding of the window and updates the match count accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem and should produce the correct output for the given constraints and examples.
