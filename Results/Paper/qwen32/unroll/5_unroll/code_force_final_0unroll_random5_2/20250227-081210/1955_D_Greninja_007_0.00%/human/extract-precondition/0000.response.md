Precondition: **a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n and m ≤ 2 · 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m, and the elements of a and b are integers in the range 1 to 10^6. Additionally, t is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
