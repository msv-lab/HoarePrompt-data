Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is now assigned the value of the integer input provided, which is within the range of 1 to 1000. The conditions for `a` and `b` in the test cases remain unchanged.
