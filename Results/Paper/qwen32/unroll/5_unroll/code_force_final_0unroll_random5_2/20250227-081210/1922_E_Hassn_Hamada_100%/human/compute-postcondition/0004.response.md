The provided code snippet initializes `size_overlap` to the tuple `(0, 0)`. This operation does not affect the values of `number` or `sequence`. The only change is the assignment of `size_overlap`.

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of positive integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`.**
