The code snippet provided calls a function `func_1` with a specific argument and the `sequence` variable. The call does not modify `sequence` directly; instead, it passes a new value calculated from `number`, `size`, and `overlap` to `func_1`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we assume it does not alter the `sequence` or any other variables outside its scope unless explicitly stated.

The argument passed to `func_1` is `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`. This expression calculates a new value based on the current values of `number`, `size`, and `overlap`.

Given that the initial state specifies `sequence` is extended by numbers from `overlap` to `size - 1`, this precondition remains unchanged after the function call.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`sequence` is extended by numbers from `overlap` to `size - 1`. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.**
