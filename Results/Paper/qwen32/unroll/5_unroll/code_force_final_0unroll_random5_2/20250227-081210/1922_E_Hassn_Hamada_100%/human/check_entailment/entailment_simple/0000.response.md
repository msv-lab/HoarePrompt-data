Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the sequence based on the number of subsequences. The logic inside `func_1` is not aligned with the problem requirements.

2. **Incorrect Input Handling:** The variable `n` inside the loop is incorrectly used as the number of increasing subsequences. Instead, `n` is the number of test cases, and the number of increasing subsequences should be read inside the loop.

3. **State Management:** The state management inside `func_1` is incorrect. The function is expected to modify the `sequence` list based on the number of increasing subsequences required, but the current logic does not achieve this correctly.

4. **Output:** The program is supposed to output the length of the array and the array itself. However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the array based on the number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Base Case Handling:** The base case in `func_1` (when `number == 0`) should return an appropriate result, but the current implementation returns `0, 0`, which is not meaningful in this context.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
