Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences as required by the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences. However, the execution summary indicates that the function always returns `(0, 0)`, which is not consistent with its intended purpose.

2. The function does append values to the `sequence` list, but the logic for appending values and the recursive calls within `func_1` do not guarantee that the final sequence will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic appears to be incorrect or incomplete.

3. The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to find an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. It should print `-1` in such cases, but the current implementation does not check for this condition.

4. The program does not correctly handle the input X, as it simply calls `func_1(n - 1, result)` without ensuring that the sequence generated will have exactly X increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
