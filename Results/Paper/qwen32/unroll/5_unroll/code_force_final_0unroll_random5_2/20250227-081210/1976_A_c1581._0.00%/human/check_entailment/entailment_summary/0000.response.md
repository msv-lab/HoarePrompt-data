Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to verify if a given password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The program separates digits and letters into two separate lists. This step is not required for the final verification but helps in checking if the digits and letters are sorted individually.

2. **Checking Order of Digits and Letters**: The program checks if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order by comparing the lists to their sorted versions.

3. **Checking Digit Placement**: The program iterates through the password to ensure that no letter appears after a digit. This is done by tracking the last index where a digit was found and checking if any letter appears after this index.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It ensures that:
- All digits are in non-decreasing order.
- All letters are in non-decreasing order.
- No letter appears after any digit.

The execution summary provided also aligns with the program's behavior, confirming that the function `func_1` correctly checks the conditions for a strong password.

Given the analysis, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
