You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the function `func_1` that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the case where the password contains only digits or only letters. While the function checks that digits and letters are sorted and that no digit comes after a letter, it does not ensure that the entire password meets the conditions specified.

Let's consider the following test cases:

1. **Password with only digits:**
   - Input: `n = 3, password = "321"`
   - Expected Output: `NO` (because the digits are not in non-decreasing order)
   - Actual Output: `YES` (the function does not check the order of digits when there are no letters)

2. **Password with only letters:**
   - Input: `n = 3, password = "cba"`
   - Expected Output: `NO` (because the letters are not in non-decreasing order)
   - Actual Output: `YES` (the function does not check the order of letters when there are no digits)

To fix the program, the function `func_1` should be modified to ensure that the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order regardless of whether there are both digits and letters, only digits, or only letters in the password.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
            last_digit_index = i
        else:
            letters.append(char)
            if last_digit_index != -1:
                return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected version ensures that the function checks the order of digits and letters correctly, even when the password contains only digits or only letters.
