### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly implements the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of this list is the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each password.
   - Inside `func_1`, the password is traversed to separate digits and letters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It then checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by keeping track of the index of the last digit encountered (`last_digit_index`). If a letter is found after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks are passed, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are collected in a list and printed as a newline-separated string.

### Verification:
- The program correctly checks if there are any digits following letters.
- It correctly checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All conditions specified in the problem description are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implementing the problem requirements. Therefore, based on the provided logic and the given examples, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
