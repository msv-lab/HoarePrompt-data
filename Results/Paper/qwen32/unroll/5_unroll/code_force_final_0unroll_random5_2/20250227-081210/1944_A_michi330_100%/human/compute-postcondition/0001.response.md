The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
