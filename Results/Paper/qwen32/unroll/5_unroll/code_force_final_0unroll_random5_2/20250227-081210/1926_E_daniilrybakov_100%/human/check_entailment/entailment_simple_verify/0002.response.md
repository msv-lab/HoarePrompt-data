### Reasoning

The program uses a binary approach to determine the k-th card in the sequence, which is a clever and efficient way to solve the problem. Let's break down the logic step-by-step using the annotations and validate it against the problem description and examples.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 0, representing the starting index of the current segment of cards.
   - `m` is initialized to 1, representing the multiplier for the current segment of cards.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - `x = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the number of odd-numbered cards in the current segment.
   - `n //= 2` reduces `n` to consider the next segment (twice an odd number, then three times, etc.).
   - The condition `if s < k and k <= s + x` checks if the k-th card falls within the current segment.
     - If true, the loop breaks, and the k-th card is calculated.
     - If false, `s` is incremented by `x`, and `m` is doubled to move to the next segment.

3. **Card Calculation**:
   - Once the correct segment is found, the k-th card is calculated using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula works because:
     - `k - s` gives the position of the card within the current segment.
     - `2 * (k - s) - 1` converts this position to the corresponding odd number in the current segment.
     - Multiplying by `m` scales this odd number to the correct segment (e.g., odd numbers, twice odd numbers, etc.).

### Validation with Examples

Let's validate the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1: n=7, k=1
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `1 <= 4`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (1 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 1`.

#### Example 2: n=7, k=2
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `2 <= 4`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (2 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 3`.

#### Example 3: n=7, k=3
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `3 <= 4`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (3 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 5`.

#### Example 4: n=7, k=4
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `4 <= 4`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (4 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 7`.

#### Example 5: n=7, k=5
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `5 > 4`, the loop continues.
- `s += x` → `s=4`, `m *= 2` → `m=2`.
- `x = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`, `n //= 2` → `n=1`.
- Since `5 <= 6`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (5 - 4) - 1) * 2 = 2`.

#### Example 6: n=7, k=6
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `6 > 4`, the loop continues.
- `s += x` → `s=4`, `m *= 2` → `m=2`.
- `x = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`, `n //= 2` → `n=1`.
- Since `6 <= 6`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (6 - 4) - 1) * 2 = 6`.

#### Example 7: n=7, k=7
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `7 > 4`, the loop continues.
- `s += x` → `s=4`, `m *= 2` → `m=2`.
- `x = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`, `n //= 2` → `n=1`.
- Since `7 > 6`, the loop continues.
- `s += x` → `s=6`, `m *= 2` → `m=4`.
- `x = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`, `n //= 2` → `n=0`.
- Since `7 <= 7`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (7 - 6) - 1) * 4 = 4`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card in the sequence as described in the problem statement. It efficiently finds the correct card using a binary approach without generating the entire sequence.
