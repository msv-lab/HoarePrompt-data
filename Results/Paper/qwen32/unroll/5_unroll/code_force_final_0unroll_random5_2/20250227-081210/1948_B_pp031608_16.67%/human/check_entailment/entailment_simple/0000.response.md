Reasoning: 

The provided program attempts to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. The program does this by iterating through the list and checking if the current list is sorted using the `func_1` function. If the list is not sorted, it tries to split the previous element if it is greater than 10 and greater than the current element. However, the logic for performing the split and checking the list is flawed.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. The `func_1` function is called inside the loop that iterates through the list, but the result is not used to break out of the loop or to make any decisions about further splits.
2. The logic for splitting the number and reinserting the digits is incorrect. It only considers the case where the previous element is greater than 10 and greater than the current element, but it does not handle all possible cases where splitting could help sort the list.
3. The loop only goes from the second element to the end of the list, but it modifies the list in place, which can cause issues with the loop indices.
4. The program does not handle all possible scenarios where multiple splits might be necessary, or where splits need to be performed on elements other than the previous one.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if the list can be sorted by the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
