Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits. The program iterates over each test case, applies the splitting operation where applicable, and checks if the resulting array is sorted.

However, there are a few issues with the provided code that prevent it from functioning correctly:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements**: The program attempts to split elements when it finds an unsorted pair, but it does this in a way that does not guarantee the array will eventually be sorted. Specifically, it only splits the element at the previous index (`p - 1`) when the current element (`p`) is smaller, but it does not handle cases where the element at `p - 1` might still need to be split after the current element is processed. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about whether the array can be sorted.

2. **Infinite Loop Possibility**: The program does not ensure that it will terminate after a finite number of operations. If the array repeatedly becomes unsorted after splitting, the loop could potentially run indefinitely.

3. **Lack of Proper Iteration**: The program only checks for unsorted pairs once per test case without re-evaluating the entire array after each split operation. This means that it might miss opportunities to sort the array by not checking the entire array after each split.

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if the list is sorted, but it is not used effectively within the main loop to ensure that the array is sorted after each split operation.

To fix these issues, the program should repeatedly attempt to split elements until no more splits can be made or the array is sorted. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(lst):
    while True:
        sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
        if lst == sorted_lst:
            return True
        modified = False
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if lst[i] >= 10:
                # Split the number into its digits
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(lst[i])]
                lst = lst[:i] + digits + lst[i+1:]
                modified = True
                break
        if not modified:
            return False

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(lst):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version uses a helper function `can_be_sorted` that repeatedly splits elements and checks if the array is sorted. It ensures that the entire array is checked after each split operation.

Correctness: **False**
