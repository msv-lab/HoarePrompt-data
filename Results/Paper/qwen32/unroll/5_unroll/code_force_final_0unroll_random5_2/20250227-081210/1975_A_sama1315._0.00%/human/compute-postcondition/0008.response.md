To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`arr`**: This is a list of integers from the last test case.
2. **`index`**: This is the position right after the last integer of the last test case in `data`. However, the exact value of `index` is not relevant to the print statement.
3. **`results`**: This is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each test case. The exact contents of this list depend on the output of `func_1(arr)` for each test case.
4. **`t`**: This variable is unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
5. **`data`**: This variable is unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

### Analysis:
The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will concatenate all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). The exact output will depend on the contents of the `results` list.

Since we don't have the exact contents of the `results` list, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `results`.

### Output Description:
The `results` list contains the results of `func_1(arr)` for each test case. The `print` statement will print each element of the `results` list on a new line.

Output: **Each element of the `results` list, separated by a newline character (where each element is the result of `func_1(arr)` for a test case)**
