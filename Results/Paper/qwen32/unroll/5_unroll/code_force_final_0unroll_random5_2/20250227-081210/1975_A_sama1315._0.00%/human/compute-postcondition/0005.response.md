The given code snippet only initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`arr`, `input`, `data`, `index`, `t`) are modified by this code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
