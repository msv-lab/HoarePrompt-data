The code reads a line of input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This list of substrings is then assigned to the variable `data`. The original list `arr` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line.**
