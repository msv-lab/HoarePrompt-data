### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The provided code consists of two functions:

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - This function does not handle the operation of splitting and swapping parts of the array to determine if the array can be sorted by such operations.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` to determine if the array can be sorted and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Issue:
The provided code only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the described operations (splitting and swapping parts of the array). Therefore, the code is not correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
