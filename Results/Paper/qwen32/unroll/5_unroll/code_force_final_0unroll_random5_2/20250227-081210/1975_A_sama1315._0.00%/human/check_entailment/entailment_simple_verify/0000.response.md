### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and returns 'Yes' if it is. However, if the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' only if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are out of order. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation.

To understand why the program is incorrect, let's re-examine the logic of `func_1`:

1. **Check if Already Sorted**: The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`. If true, it returns 'Yes'.
2. **Check for Any Out-of-Order Pair**: If the array is not sorted, the function checks if there is any pair of adjacent elements that are out of order using the condition `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`. If true, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

The issue is that the function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the operation multiple times. The operation allows splitting the array into two parts and swapping them, which can potentially rearrange the elements to form a sorted array.

### Example Analysis:
Consider the test case:
```
1
4
2 3 1 4
```
The function `func_1` will return 'No' because there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are out of order (3 and 1). However, the array can indeed be sorted by performing the operation multiple times:
- Split into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, then swap to get `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- Split into `x=[1, 4]` and `y=[2, 3]`, then swap to get `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- Split into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, then swap to get `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- Split into `x=[1]` and `y=[4, 2, 3]`, then swap to get `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- Split into `x=[4]` and `y=[2, 3, 1]`, then swap to get `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- Split into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, then swap to get `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- Split into `x=[1, 4]` and `y=[2, 3]`, then swap to get `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- Split into `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]`, then swap to get `[3, 1, 4, 2]`.
- Split into `x=[3]` and `y=[1, 4, 2]`, then swap to get `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- Split into `x=[1, 4]` and `y=[2, 3]`, then swap to get `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- Split into `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]`, then swap to get `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- Split into `x=[4, 2]` and `y=[3, 1]`, then swap to get `[3, 1, 4, 2]`.
- Split into `x=[3, 1]` and `y=[4, 2]`, then swap to get `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- Split into `x=[4]` and `y=[2, 3, 1]`, then swap to get `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- Split into `x=[2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y=[]`, then swap to get `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- Split into `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]`, then swap to get `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- Split into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, then swap to get `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- Split into `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]`, then swap to get `[3, 1, 4, 2]`.
- Split into `x=[]` and `y=[2, 3, 1, 4]`, then swap to get `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.

However, the function `func_1` will not recognize this possibility and will incorrectly return 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the operation multiple times.

**Final: False**
