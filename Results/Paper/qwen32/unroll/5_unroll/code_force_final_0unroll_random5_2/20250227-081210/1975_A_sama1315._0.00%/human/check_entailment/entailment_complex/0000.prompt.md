Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers with length `n` such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` where the first element is greater than the second element.
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of positive integers with a length between 2 and 50. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and returns 'Yes' if it is, otherwise it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n positive integers, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `arr` is the list of integers from the last test case, `index` is the position right after the last integer of the last test case in `data`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, `t` is unchanged, and `data` is unchanged.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: Each element of the `results` list, separated by a newline character (where each element is the result of `func_1(arr)` for a test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of positive integers. For each test case, it computes the result using `func_1` and prints the results, each on a new line.
