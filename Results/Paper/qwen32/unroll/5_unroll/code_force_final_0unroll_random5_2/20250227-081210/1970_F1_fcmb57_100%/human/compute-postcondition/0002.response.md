Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's evaluate the output.

- `a` is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd.
- `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd.
- `x` is the first element of `a`, which means `x` is the same as `a` since `a` is an integer.
- `dx` is equal to `b`.
- `dy` is undefined, but since it is used in the return statement, we can infer that the problem intends for `dy` to be treated as 0 or some neutral value, given the context. However, since `dy` is explicitly stated as undefined and we need to adhere to the given information, we will consider `dy` as it is.

The code snippet is:
```python
return x + dx, y + dy
```

Since `y` is not defined in the initial state, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the description. However, based on the provided variables and the code, we can only use `x`, `dx`, and `dy` for the calculation. Given `dy` is undefined, we'll consider the return statement with only `x` and `dx`.

Output State: **The program returns (x + dx, y + dy), where x is the integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, dx is the integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, and dy is undefined. Since dy is undefined, the exact second part of the return value cannot be determined.**

However, if we assume `dy` should logically be 0 for the operation to make sense in the context of movement or position change, then:

Output State: **The program returns (a + b, y + dy), where `a` is the number of lines (N) in the field, `b` is the number of columns (M) in the field, and `dy` is undefined. If `dy` is considered 0, the return value is (a + b, y).** 

Given the problem's constraints and the information provided, the most accurate response based on the given data is:

Output State: **The program returns (a + b, y + dy), where `a` is the number of lines (N) in the field, `b` is the number of columns (M) in the field, and `dy` is undefined.**
