Precondition: **a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a list of N strings, each string contains M pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities on the field. The next input is an integer T representing the number of steps, followed by T lines each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action line starts with a pair of characters representing the entity and is followed by a character representing the action (U, D, L, R, C, or T), and optionally by a pair of characters if the action is C (catch).**
