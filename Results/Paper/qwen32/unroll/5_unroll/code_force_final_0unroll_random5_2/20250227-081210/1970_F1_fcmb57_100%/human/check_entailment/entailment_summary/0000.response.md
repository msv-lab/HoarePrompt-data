Reasoning:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is defined at the end of the program but is used before its definition. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The program does not handle the boundaries of the field correctly. Players should not be able to move outside the field, but the program does not check this.

3. **Quaffle Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the Quaffle. It does not keep track of which player is carrying the Quaffle and does not move the Quaffle back to the center of the field when a goal is scored.

4. **Goal Scoring Logic**: The program checks if a player is at a goal position after a throw action, but it does not account for the team of the goal. For instance, if a red player scores in a red goal, it should count as a point for the blue team, and vice versa.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the score at the end, but it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
