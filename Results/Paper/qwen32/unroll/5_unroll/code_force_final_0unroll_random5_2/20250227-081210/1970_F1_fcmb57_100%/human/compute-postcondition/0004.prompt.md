You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a list of N strings, each string contains M pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities on the field. The next input is an integer T representing the number of steps, followed by T lines each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action line starts with a pair of characters representing the entity and is followed by a character representing the action (U, D, L, R, C, or T), and optionally by a pair of characters if the action is C (catch).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (a + b, y + dy), where `a` is the number of lines (N) in the field, `b` is the number of columns (M) in the field, and `dy` is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of lines (N) and columns (M) in the field, respectively. It also accepts a field represented as a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a series of T actions performed by entities on the field. The function returns a tuple `(a + b, y + dy)`, where `a` is the number of lines, `b` is the number of columns, and `dy` is undefined.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns (a + b, y + dy), where `a` is the number of lines (N) in the field, `b` is the number of columns (M) in the field, and `dy` is undefined.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
