#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a list of N strings, each string contains M pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities on the field. The next input is an integer T representing the number of steps, followed by T lines each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action line starts with a pair of characters representing the entity and is followed by a character representing the action (U, D, L, R, C, or T), and optionally by a pair of characters if the action is C (catch).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (a + b, y + dy), where `a` is the number of lines (N) in the field, `b` is the number of columns (M) in the field, and `dy` is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two tuples as input, each containing two integers, and returns a tuple with the sum of the first elements of the input tuples and the sum of the second elements of the input tuples. The function does not utilize the field or actions described in the comments.
