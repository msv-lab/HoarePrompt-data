You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of sorted city distances and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum sum of distances required to travel from one city to another, avoiding a specified city in between.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another based on the rules given in the problem statement. The main issue is that the program does not properly determine the closest city for each city and does not correctly compute the minimum cost considering the two possible actions (paying 1 coin to travel to the closest city or paying the distance to travel directly to another city).

Let's break down the issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The program attempts to calculate some kind of cumulative distance (`s`) as it traverses the list of cities, but it does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. The closest city should be the one with the minimum distance, and this is not correctly computed in the given code.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program calculates `s1` and `s2` based on the cumulative distances stored in `d1` and `d2`, but these cumulative distances do not represent the actual cost to travel between cities according to the problem statement. The cost should either be the number of steps taken to reach the destination using the closest city rule or the direct distance between the cities.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle cases where the cities are very close together or very far apart in an optimal way. It also does not handle cases where the cities are distributed in such a way that the closest city changes frequently.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
Input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
3
1 5
2 4
3 5
```
Expected Output:
```
8
1
6
```
Explanation of Expected Output:
- For query (1, 5): The optimal path is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which costs 8 coins.
- For query (2, 4): The optimal path is 2 -> 3 -> 4, which costs 1 coin.
- For query (3, 5): The optimal path is 3 -> 4 -> 5, which costs 6 coins.

The provided program will not produce these results correctly, hence it is incorrect.
