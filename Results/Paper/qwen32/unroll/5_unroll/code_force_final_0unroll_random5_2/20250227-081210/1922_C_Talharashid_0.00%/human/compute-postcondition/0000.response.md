Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= `n` and `x_i` != `y_i`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is uniquely determined.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) remain unchanged and still hold their initial descriptions and constraints.
