The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user, which will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 676. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
