Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate the required string `s` for each test case. The program's logic is flawed, especially in how it constructs the string `s` and handles different values of `n` and `k`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues in the program:

1. **String Construction**: The program constructs the string `s` by appending the first `k` lowercase English letters. However, this string does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are present.

2. **Handling `n` and `k`**: The program uses a simple repetition of the string `s` based on the value of `n` and `k`. This does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the final string `s`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is greater than 1 and `k` is greater than 1.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible approach is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring. However, the problem requires the sequences to appear as subsequences, not substrings, so the approach needs to be adapted accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program that generates the required string `s`:

```python
def generate_string(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return ''.join(chr(97 + i) for i in range(k))
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k letters
    from itertools import product
    all_subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Construct the string s by appending each subsequence in order
    s = ''.join(all_subsequences)
    
    return s

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(generate_string(n, k))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version generates all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters and concatenates them to form the string `s`. This ensures that all required subsequences are present in `s`.
