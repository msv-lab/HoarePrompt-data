### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of calculating Alice's optimal profit given the constraints and the behavior of both Alice and Bob. Let's break down the program and evaluate its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided execution summaries of the functions.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Reads the number of test cases from the input.
   - **Execution Summary**: Reads a single integer from the input, which is the number of test cases. This function is correctly implemented as per the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Reads integers from the input.
   - **Execution Summary**: Reads a line from the input, splits it by whitespace, and converts each element to an integer. This function is correctly implemented for reading both `n` and `k` as well as the lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculates the sum of values based on the conditions provided.
   - **Execution Summary**: This function sums up the `a_i` values from `sec_arr` and adds to it the sum of `(b_i - a_i)` for all tuples in `main_ar` where `(b_i - a_i) + a_i` is greater than or equal to 0. This seems to be a bit off in understanding the problem. It should be calculating the profit based on the remaining items after Bob takes `k` items for free and the rest Bob pays for.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - **Initialization**: Reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads `n`, `k`, the list of prices `a` for Alice, and the list of prices `b` for Bob.
   - **Sorting**: The items are sorted based on Bob's prices `b` in ascending order.
   - **Heap Operations**: Uses a max heap (implemented as a min heap with negative values) to maintain the `k` items that Bob will take for free. This part is correctly implemented.
   - **Profit Calculation**: The program calculates the profit by iterating through the items and adjusting the profit based on the conditions. However, the logic in `func_3` and the main loop needs careful review to ensure it correctly maximizes Alice's profit.

### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue lies in the logic of calculating the profit in the main loop and the use of `func_3`. The function `func_3` does not correctly compute the profit based on the problem's requirements. It should consider the remaining items after Bob takes `k` items for free and then calculate the profit based on the items Bob pays for.
- The main loop should correctly adjust the profit by considering the items Bob takes for free and the items he buys from Alice.

### Conclusion:
The provided program contains logical errors in the profit calculation, particularly in the use of `func_3` and the main loop. This means that the program does not always compute the correct optimal profit for Alice.

**Correctness: False**
