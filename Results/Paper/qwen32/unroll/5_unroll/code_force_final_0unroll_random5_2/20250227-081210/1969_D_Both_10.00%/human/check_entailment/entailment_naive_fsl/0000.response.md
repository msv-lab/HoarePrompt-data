Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program consists of three functions, but none of them seem to address the core requirements of the problem, which involve making optimal choices for both Alice and Bob.

Here are the issues with the provided code:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not have any relevance to the problem description. They seem to be utility functions but do not perform the required operations.

2. **Input Handling**: The code does not handle the input as described in the problem. There is no indication of reading the number of test cases (`t`), the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, or the lists `a_i` and `b_i`.

3. **Logic for Optimal Choices**: The problem requires Alice to choose a subset of items to maximize her profit, considering Bob's optimal strategy. The provided function `func_3` does not implement this logic. It simply sums up some values but does not consider the constraints or the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

4. **Output**: The program does not produce any output, which is a requirement for each test case.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read `n` and `k`, and the lists `a_i` and `b_i`.
- Implement a strategy for Alice to choose items to maximize her profit, considering Bob's optimal strategy of taking `k` items for free and buying the rest.
- Output the maximum profit for each test case.

Since the provided code does not meet these requirements, it is incorrect.
