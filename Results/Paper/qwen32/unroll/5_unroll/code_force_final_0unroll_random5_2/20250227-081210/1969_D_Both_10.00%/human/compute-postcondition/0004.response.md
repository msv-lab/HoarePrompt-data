To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given code and the initial state description:

- `main_ar` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers. The first element of each tuple is the difference between `b_i` and `a_i` (i.e., `b_i - a_i`).
- `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains one integer, which is the `a_i` value.
- `sub_summ` is the sum of all `a_i` values from the tuples in `sec_arr`.

The loop iterates over each tuple in `main_ar` and checks if the sum of the first and second elements of the tuple is greater than or equal to 0. If the condition is met, it adds the sum of these two elements to `sub_summ`.

Let's denote:
- `main_ar` as `[(b1 - a1, x1), (b2 - a2, x2), ..., (bn - an, xn)]`
- `sec_arr` as `[(a1,), (a2,), ..., (an,)]`
- `sub_summ` as the initial sum of all `a_i` values.

During each iteration of the loop, if `(b_i - a_i) + x_i >= 0`, then `sub_summ` is updated by adding `(b_i - a_i) + x_i` to it.

After the loop finishes, `sub_summ` will have been incremented by the sum of `(b_i - a_i) + x_i` for all tuples in `main_ar` where the condition is satisfied.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged. `sub_summ` is the initial sum of all `a_i` values plus the sum of `(b_i - a_i) + x_i` for all tuples in `main_ar` where `(b_i - a_i) + x_i >= 0`.**
