You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program consists of three functions, but none of them seem to address the core requirements of the problem, which involve making optimal choices for both Alice and Bob.

Here are the issues with the provided code:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not have any relevance to the problem description. They seem to be utility functions but do not perform the required operations.

2. **Input Handling**: The code does not handle the input as described in the problem. There is no indication of reading the number of test cases (`t`), the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, or the lists `a_i` and `b_i`.

3. **Logic for Optimal Choices**: The problem requires Alice to choose a subset of items to maximize her profit, considering Bob's optimal strategy. The provided function `func_3` does not implement this logic. It simply sums up some values but does not consider the constraints or the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

4. **Output**: The program does not produce any output, which is a requirement for each test case.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read `n` and `k`, and the lists `a_i` and `b_i`.
- Implement a strategy for Alice to choose items to maximize her profit, considering Bob's optimal strategy of taking `k` items for free and buying the rest.
- Output the maximum profit for each test case.

Since the provided code does not meet these requirements, it is incorrect.
