To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1()`. However, since `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, we can only infer the state based on the loop structure.

The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`. The variables in the loop head (`_` and `t`) are the only ones that are affected by the loop itself. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and remains unchanged throughout the loop. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use, so it does not affect any state outside the loop.

Since `func_1()` is called `t` times and its effect is not specified, we can only state that the loop will execute `func_1()` exactly `t` times. The state of `t` will remain the same after the loop completes.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged and `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**
