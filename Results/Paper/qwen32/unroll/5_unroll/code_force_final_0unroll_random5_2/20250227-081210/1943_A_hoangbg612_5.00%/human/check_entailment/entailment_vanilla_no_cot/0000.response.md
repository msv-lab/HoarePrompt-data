Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array `a`. Sorting is a common technique to simplify the process of finding gaps in the sequence of numbers.

3. **Tracking MEX:**
   - The program initializes `cur` to `-1`, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It also initializes an empty dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in the array.
   - The program then iterates over the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if there's a gap (i.e., `num > cur + 1`). If there is, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop. If not, it updates `cur` to `num` and adds it to the dictionary `M`.
     - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S` (the size of the array). If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from `0` to `cur` to find the smallest index `i` where the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If such an index is found, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which is the MEX.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
- The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
- The program does not ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX while Bob minimizes it.

### Correct Approach:
- Alice should aim to add numbers in such a way that she maximizes the MEX.
- Bob should aim to block Alice from increasing the MEX.
- The optimal strategy involves keeping track of the smallest missing number and ensuring that the game ends with the highest possible MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob, and the logic for calculating the MEX is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
