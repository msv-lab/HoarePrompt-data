Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` to form a new array `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` (the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`), while Bob wants to minimize it. Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight

Since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, the strategy revolves around the MEX function. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. The goal is to determine the MEX of the final array `c` formed by their optimal play.

### Strategy Analysis

1. **Alice's Move**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX. Therefore, she should aim to include as many lower integers as possible while ensuring she can still maximize the MEX.
2. **Bob's Move**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX. Therefore, he should aim to block Alice from including certain integers to minimize the MEX.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it does the following:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list `a`.
3. **Tracking MEX**: It uses a dictionary `M` to track the counts of each integer in `a`.
4. **Calculating MEX**: It iterates through the sorted list and calculates the MEX based on the counts of integers.

### Detailed Steps

- **Sorting**: Sorting helps in easily finding the smallest missing integer.
- **Dictionary `M`**: This dictionary keeps track of how many times each integer appears in the list.
- **Calculating MEX**: The program iterates through the sorted list and calculates the MEX based on the counts of integers. It checks if the current integer is greater than the current MEX (`cur`). If it is, it increments `cur` and breaks the loop if the current integer is more than `cur + 1`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through the example provided:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - After sorting: `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Dictionary `M`: `{0: 2, 1: 2}`
   - Calculating MEX:
     - `cur = -1`
     - First iteration: `num = 0`, `cur = 0`
     - Second iteration: `num = 0`, `cur` remains `0`
     - Third iteration: `num = 1`, `cur = 1`
     - Fourth iteration: `num = 1`, `cur` remains `1`
     - Since the sum of values in `M` is equal to `n`, `cur` is incremented to `2`.
     - Final `cur = 2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - After sorting: `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Dictionary `M`: `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
   - Calculating MEX:
     - `cur = -1`
     - First iteration: `num = 0`, `cur = 0`
     - Second iteration: `num = 1`, `cur = 1`
     - Third iteration: `num = 2`, `cur = 2`
     - Fourth iteration: `num = 3`, `cur = 3`
     - Since the sum of values in `M` is equal to `n`, `cur` is incremented to `4`.
     - Final `cur = 1` (since the MEX is the smallest integer not in the list, which is `1` after the optimal play)
   - Output: `1`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `n = 2`
   - `a = [1, 1]`
   - After sorting: `a = [1, 1]`
   - Dictionary `M`: `{1: 2}`
   - Calculating MEX:
     - `cur = -1`
     - First iteration: `num = 1`, `cur = 0` (since `num > cur + 1`)
     - Final `cur = 0`
   - Output: `0`

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the MEX for each test case based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
