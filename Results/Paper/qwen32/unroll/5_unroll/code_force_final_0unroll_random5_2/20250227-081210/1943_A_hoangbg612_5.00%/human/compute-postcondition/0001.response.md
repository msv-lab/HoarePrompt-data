In the given for loop, the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is at least 1. The variable `t` is not part of the loop head and does not affect whether the loop executes or not. The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the problem description but are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `T` is at least 1. The state of `t` can remain as it is since it does not impact the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
