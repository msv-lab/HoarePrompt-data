### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly computes the MEX for each test case.

1. **Sorting the Array**: The code sorts the array `N`. This step is crucial because it helps in easily finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Tracking Occurrences**: The code uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in the sorted array `N`.

3. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1. This variable is used to track the current candidate for MEX.
   - The code iterates through the sorted array `N`. For each number `num` in `N`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it means we have found a gap in the sequence of numbers. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur + 1` is the MEX, and the loop breaks.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `num`.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur`, the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M` is incremented.
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the length of the array `N`), it means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `N`. Therefore, `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - Finally, the code checks if there is any `i < cur` such that the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If such an `i` is found, `cur` is updated to `i` and the loop breaks.

4. **Output**: The final value of `cur` is printed as the MEX for each test case.

### Analysis:

The logic used in the code seems correct for finding the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The sorting step ensures that we can easily find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. The dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of each number, which helps in determining the MEX efficiently.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly computes the MEX for each test case as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
