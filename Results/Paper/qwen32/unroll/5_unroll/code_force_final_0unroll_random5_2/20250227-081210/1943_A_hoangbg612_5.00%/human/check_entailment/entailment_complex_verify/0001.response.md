### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a`. Alice starts with an empty array `c`. They take turns picking an element from `a`, appending it to `c` (only for Alice), and deleting it from `a`. The game ends when `a` is empty. The goal is to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` for Alice and minimize it for Bob, assuming both play optimally.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to find the optimal MEX by sorting the array and then iterating through it to determine the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` after optimal play.

#### Key Steps in the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `T` is read.
   - For each test case, the size `S` of the array `a` and the elements of `a` are read.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted.

3. **Tracking Elements:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of each element in `N`.
   - A variable `cur` is used to track the current smallest non-negative integer not yet encountered in `N`.

4. **Iterating Through Sorted Array:**
   - The code iterates through the sorted array `N`. If the current number is greater than `cur`, it checks if the gap between `cur` and the current number is more than 1. If so, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it updates `cur` to the current number and records its count in `M`.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - After the loop, if all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `M` with counts matching their values, `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - The code then checks if any number less than `cur` has a count less than or equal to its value. If such a number is found, `cur` is updated to that number.

6. **Output:**
   - The final value of `cur` is printed as the MEX.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Inadequate Handling of Bob's Moves:**
  - The code does not explicitly account for Bob's moves, which are crucial for determining the final MEX. Bob's strategy of minimizing the MEX affects the outcome, and the current code does not simulate this.
  
- **Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX:**
  - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The code does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns and the final MEX is determined based on the optimal play of both players.

Let's consider the annotated version of the code to further validate or challenge the original assessment:

```python
#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        N.sort()
        
        cur = -1
        
        M = {}
        
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        
        print(cur)
        
    #State: The final printed value of `cur` for each of the `T` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer `cur` which represents the smallest integer such that the number of integers in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `i` is greater than `i` for all `i < cur`.
```

The annotations suggest that the code is attempting to find the smallest integer `cur` such that the number of integers in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `i` is greater than `i` for all `i < cur`. However, this logic does not account for the alternating turns of Alice and Bob and the strategic choices they make to maximize or minimize the MEX.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the optimal MEX for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
