Reasoning:  
The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. By sorting the array, we can achieve this by pairing the largest available number with the smallest available number, the second largest with the second smallest, and so on. This strategy ensures that the differences are maximized.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements and the elements themselves.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It calculates the sum of differences by pairing the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.
5. It prints the result for each test case.

The implementation correctly follows the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The example test cases provided in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program, as seen in the annotated program's explanation.

Correctness: **True**
