The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `ntest`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `ntest` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
