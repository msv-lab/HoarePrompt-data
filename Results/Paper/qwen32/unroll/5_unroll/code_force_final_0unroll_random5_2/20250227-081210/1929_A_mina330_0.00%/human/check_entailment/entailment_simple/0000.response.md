Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the strategy should be to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. 

The provided program sorts the array and then computes the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second-largest and second-smallest elements, and so on. This approach ensures that the largest possible differences are added to the sum, thereby maximizing the beauty of the array.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `3, 2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Beauty: `(3-1) + (2-2) = 2`
   - The program outputs `2`, which is correct.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `3, 69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
   - The program outputs `0`, which is correct.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5, 100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Beauty: `(100-43) + (90-54) = 57`
   - The program outputs `57`, which is correct.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4, 3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Beauty: `(4-3) + (3-3) = 1`
   - The program outputs `1`, which is correct.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2, 2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`
   - The program outputs `1`, which is correct.

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case by sorting the array and summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second-largest and second-smallest elements, and so on.

Correctness: **True**
