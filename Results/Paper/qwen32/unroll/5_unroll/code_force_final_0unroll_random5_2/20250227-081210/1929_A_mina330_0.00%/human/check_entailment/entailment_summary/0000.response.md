### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The given program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

However, the approach in the provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted array, not between the largest and smallest elements as done in the program.

For example, in the first test case:
- Input: `2 1 3`
- Correctly sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- The program calculates: `(3 - 1) = 2` (only for the first pair), which is correct in this case, but this is coincidental and not the general approach.

In the third test case:
- Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
- Correctly sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
- The program calculates: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) = 57 + 36 = 93` (which is incorrect)

The provided program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly sum the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. It incorrectly pairs the largest and smallest elements, which does not maximize the beauty in all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
