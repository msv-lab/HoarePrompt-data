Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of two integers `a` and `x`. The integer `a` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is a positive integer up to 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided.**
