In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `n`, which is one of the values returned by the function `func_1()`. The other variables mentioned (`k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) are not directly part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 0, as the loop will iterate `n` times. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only the operations within the loop body.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range within the array, and `st` is a set used to store midpoints during the binary search process.**
