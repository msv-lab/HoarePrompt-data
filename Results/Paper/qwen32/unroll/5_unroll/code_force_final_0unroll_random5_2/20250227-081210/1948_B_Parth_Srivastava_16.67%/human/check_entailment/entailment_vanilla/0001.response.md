Let's analyze the provided code and compare it to the problem requirements to determine if it's correct.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `m`.
   - It then iterates `m` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The results of each test case are stored in the list `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - Iterates over each element in `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10:
       - It splits the element into its digits.
       - It checks if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit.
       - If true, it appends the digits in order to `c`.
       - If false, it appends the original number to `c`.
     - If the element is not greater than 10, it appends the element to `c` as is.
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and compares it with the original list `c`.
   - If `c` is already sorted, it appends `1` to `b` (indicating "YES"), otherwise, it appends `0` (indicating "NO").

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The code uses modulo and division to split numbers greater than 10 into digits, which is correct.
   - However, it only checks if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit to decide the order of insertion.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider the overall sorted order of the array. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, splitting `12` into `1` and `2` should not depend on the comparison between `1` and `2` but rather on the ability to sort the entire array after the split.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The code checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing, but it does not correctly handle the transformation of the array into a sorted state.
   - It should simulate the process of splitting numbers and check if it's possible to achieve a sorted array at any point, not just after a single pass.

### Correctness

Given the issues in the logic for splitting numbers and checking the sorted order, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
