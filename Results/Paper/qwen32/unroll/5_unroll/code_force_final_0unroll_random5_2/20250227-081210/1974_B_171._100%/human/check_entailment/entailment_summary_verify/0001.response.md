### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to decode a string `b` that was encoded by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart from a sorted list of unique characters of the original string `s`.
   - The decoding process involves reversing the mapping that was used during encoding.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string.
   - `func_1`:
     - Extracts unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
     - Creates a mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
     - Uses this mapping to decode `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value.
     - Returns the decoded string.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters and sorts them.
   - It creates the correct symmetric mapping.
   - It applies this mapping to decode the string.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.

4. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary is slightly inaccurate. The function `func_1` does not accept a list of tuples; it accepts a single string `b`. The summary incorrectly states that the function accepts a list of tuples, which is not the case.
   - However, the core logic described in the function summary (extracting unique characters, creating a symmetric mapping, and decoding the string) is accurate.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the smallest possible input (a single character string) correctly.
   - It handles strings with repeated characters correctly by only considering unique characters for the mapping.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.
- The program handles the input and output requirements appropriately and processes multiple test cases efficiently.
- The function summary is inaccurate in its description of the input, but the logic described is correct.

### Correctness:
- Despite the minor inaccuracy in the function summary, the program itself is correct.

Final: **True**
