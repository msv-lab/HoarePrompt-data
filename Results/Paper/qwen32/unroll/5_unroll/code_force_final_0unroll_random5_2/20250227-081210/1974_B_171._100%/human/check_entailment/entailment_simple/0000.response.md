### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s` based on the described encoding algorithm. Here's the step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Process (Function `func_1`):**
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called with the encoded string `b`.
   - It creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - Using this mapping, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings for all test cases are collected in the `results` list.
   - Each decoded string is printed.

### Correctness:

The program follows the described decoding algorithm correctly. Here are the key points that confirm its correctness:

- **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
  - The unique characters of the encoded string are correctly identified and sorted to form the string `r`.

- **Symmetric Mapping:**
  - The symmetric mapping of characters in `r` is accurately established in the `char_map` dictionary.

- **Decoding:**
  - The encoded string `b` is correctly decoded by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart from `char_map`.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program efficiently handles multiple test cases by iterating through them and processing each one independently.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
