The code snippet calculates the length of the `unique_chars` list and assigns it to the variable `len_unique`. The other variables (`encoded` and `char_map`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.**
