Output State: **The program returns a string `decoded` formed by replacing each character in all strings `b` of `encoded` with its symmetric character from `char_map`.**

In simpler terms, the program takes each character in the strings contained within the `encoded` list, finds its symmetric counterpart using the `char_map` dictionary, and constructs a new string `decoded` from these symmetric characters.
