### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Encoding Process:**
  1. Construct a string `r` from the distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
  2. Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

- **Decoding Process:**
  1. Extract unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sort them to form `r`.
  2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
  3. Use this mapping to decode `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case:
1. It reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
2. It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string.
3. `func_1`:
   - Extracts unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
   - Creates a mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Uses this mapping to decode `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value.
   - Returns the decoded string.

#### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call: `encoded` is a string `b`, not a list of tuples.
- Inside `func_1`:
  - `unique_chars` is correctly identified as a sorted list of unique characters from `b`.
  - `char_map` is correctly created with each character mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars`.
  - The decoding process correctly uses `char_map` to replace each character in `b`.

#### Verification:
- **Correctness of Unique Character Extraction and Sorting:**
  - The program correctly extracts unique characters from `b` and sorts them.
- **Correctness of Symmetric Mapping:**
  - The mapping `char_map` correctly pairs each character with its symmetric counterpart.
- **Correctness of Decoding Process:**
  - The program correctly applies the mapping to decode `b`.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by iterating through each test case and decoding the corresponding string.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Single Character String:**
  - A single character string is handled correctly since the unique character is mapped to itself.
- **Strings with Repeated Characters:**
  - Only unique characters are considered for the mapping, ensuring correct decoding.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output requirements appropriately and processes multiple test cases efficiently.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
