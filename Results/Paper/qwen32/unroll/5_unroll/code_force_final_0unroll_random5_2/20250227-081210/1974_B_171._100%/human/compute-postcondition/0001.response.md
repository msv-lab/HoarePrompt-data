The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `char_map`. This action does not affect the values of `encoded` or `unique_chars`, which remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of `char_map` as an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
