### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by finding a suitable distribution of bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the multipliers (`vals`).

2. **Calculating Product and vprod:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding multiplier (`prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`). This essentially gives a set of potential bets where the sum of these bets, when multiplied by their respective multipliers, equals the product `prod`.

3. **Calculating Denominator:**
   - The denominator (`den`) is calculated as the product minus the sum of `vprod`. This represents the difference between the total product and the total of the potential bets.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it means there is no way to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. In this case, the program outputs `-1`.
   - If `den` is positive, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets, which should satisfy the condition as per the construction of `vprod`.

### Validity:
The construction of `vprod` and the check for `den` are based on the idea that if the total product of multipliers (`prod`) is greater than the sum of the potential bets (`sum(vprod)`), then there exists a way to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

However, the program does not guarantee that the constructed bets (`vprod`) are the smallest possible bets that satisfy the condition. It only guarantees that the sum of these bets is less than the product, which is sufficient for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the feasibility of distributing the bets and outputs a valid distribution when possible. Therefore, the program is correct.
