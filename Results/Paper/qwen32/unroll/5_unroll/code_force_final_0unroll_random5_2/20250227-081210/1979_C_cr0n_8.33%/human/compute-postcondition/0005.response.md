The code snippet calculates the product of all integers in the list `vals` and then creates a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all integers in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.

Given the initial state, `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`. The new list `vprod` is created by dividing `prod` by each element in `vals`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N` is an integer read from the input. `vals` is a list of integers read from the input. `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`. `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.**
