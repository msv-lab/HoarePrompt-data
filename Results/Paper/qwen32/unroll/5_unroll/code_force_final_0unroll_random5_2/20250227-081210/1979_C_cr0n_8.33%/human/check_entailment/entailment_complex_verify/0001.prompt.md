You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N` is an integer read from the input. `vals` is a list of integers read from the input. `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`. `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: [space-separated values of vprod where each value is prod divided by the corresponding element in vals]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input, calculates the product of all integers in `vals`, and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. It then calculates a denominator `den` as the product minus the sum of `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as space-separated values. The function returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python code and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires distributing a certain amount of coins (bets) on `n` possible outcomes, each with a multiplier `k_i`. The goal is to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Formally, if `x_i` is the bet on the `i-th` outcome, the total bet `sum(x_i)` should be less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using the following steps:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of outcomes `N`.
   - Read the multipliers `vals`.
   - Calculate the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - Compute the vector `vprod` where `vprod[i] = prod // vals[i]`.
   - Calculate `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den <= 0`, print `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, print the values in `vprod`.

### Verification
Let's verify if this approach works:
- The idea behind `vprod[i] = prod // vals[i]` is to distribute the bets in such a way that each `k_i * x_i` is greater than the total bet. This is because `prod` is the product of all multipliers, and dividing by each `k_i` gives a value that, when multiplied back by `k_i`, equals the product of all other multipliers.
- The condition `den = prod - sum(vprod)` checks if the total bet is less than the minimum amount received back for any winning outcome. If `den <= 0`, it means that the total bet is not strictly less than the minimum amount received back, and hence, no valid distribution is possible.
- If `den > 0`, the distribution `vprod` is valid because:
  - For each `i`, `k_i * vprod[i] = prod - sum(vprod) + vprod[i] = prod - sum(vprod) + prod // k_i`.
  - Since `prod - sum(vprod) > 0` and `prod // k_i > 0`, `k_i * vprod[i] > sum(vprod)`, which means the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for the `i-th` outcome.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine a valid distribution of bets or determine that no valid distribution is possible.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The code correctly calculates a valid distribution of bets based on the product of multipliers and checks if the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
