The only variable in the loop head is `r`, which iterates over `vals`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `vals` is not empty. 

Given the problem statement, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, and it consists of `n` integers for each test case. Therefore, before the loop starts, `vals` should have at least one integer for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N` is an integer read from the input. `vals` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer. `prod` is 1.**
