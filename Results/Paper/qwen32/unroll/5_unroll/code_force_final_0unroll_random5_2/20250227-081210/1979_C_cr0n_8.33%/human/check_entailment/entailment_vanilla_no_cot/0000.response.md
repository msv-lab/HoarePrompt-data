To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic and the implementation:

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to distribute the bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:
- The total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
- More formally: \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \( i \).

### Implementation Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of outcomes \( n \).
2. Reads the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
3. Computes the product of all multipliers \( \text{prod} = k_1 \cdot k_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot k_n \).
4. Computes the array \( vprod \) where \( vprod[i] = \frac{\text{prod}}{k_i} \).
5. Computes the denominator \( \text{den} = \text{prod} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} vprod[i] \).
6. If \( \text{den} \leq 0 \), it prints -1 (indicating no suitable distribution).
7. Otherwise, it prints the values in \( vprod \).

### Verification of the Implementation

Let's verify if the implemented logic correctly solves the problem:
- The product \( \text{prod} \) is the product of all multipliers.
- The array \( vprod \) where \( vprod[i] = \frac{\text{prod}}{k_i} \) represents the amount to bet on each outcome.
- The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) translates to \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} vprod[i] < k_i \cdot vprod[i] \) for each \( i \).
- Since \( vprod[i] = \frac{\text{prod}}{k_i} \), we have \( k_i \cdot vprod[i] = \text{prod} \).
- Thus, the condition becomes \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} vprod[i] < \text{prod} \), which is equivalent to \( \text{prod} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} vprod[i] > 0 \).
- This is exactly the condition checked by the program.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a suitable distribution of bets exists and to output such a distribution if it exists.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
