Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted. This step is intended to help in finding the MEX by making it easier to identify gaps in the sequence of numbers.

3. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array.
   - The program iterates over the sorted array `N`. If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if there is a gap (`num > cur + 1`). If there is a gap, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks out of the loop. If there is no gap, it updates `cur` to `num` and records the count of `num` in `M`.
   - After the loop, if all numbers from `0` to `cur` have been seen (checked by comparing the sum of counts in `M` with `S`), it increments `cur` by `1` to account for the next missing number.
   - The program then creates a list `cnt` of numbers that appear exactly once in `M`.
   - If there are at least two numbers in `cnt`, it sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `cur`, which is intended to be the MEX of the final array `c`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
  - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the case where the MEX is not simply the next number after the largest number in the array. It incorrectly assumes that if all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present, the MEX is `cur + 1`.
  - The handling of numbers that appear exactly once (`cnt`) is also incorrect. It does not correctly determine the MEX based on the presence of gaps in the sequence of numbers.

- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - The program does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program does not simulate the game turns or consider the impact of each player's choices on the final MEX.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for calculating the MEX and the lack of consideration for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
