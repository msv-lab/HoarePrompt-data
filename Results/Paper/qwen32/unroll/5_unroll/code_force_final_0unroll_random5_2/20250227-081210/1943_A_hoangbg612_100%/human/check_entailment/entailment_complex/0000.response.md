Let's analyze the given program and the logic it follows to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the final score of a game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` to form a new array `c`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- **MEX (Minimum Excludant)**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- **Constraints**: Multiple test cases, each with an array `a` of size `n` where `0 â‰¤ a_i < n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted.
3. **Tracking MEX**:
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number.
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX.
   - As the sorted list is traversed, `cur` is updated to the smallest missing integer in the sequence.
4. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals `n`, it means all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present, so `cur` is incremented.
   - If there are at least two unique numbers with a count of `1`, `cur` is set to the second smallest of these numbers.
5. **Output**: The final value of `cur` is printed for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:
1. **Optimal Strategy Handling**: The program does not explicitly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It simply calculates the MEX of the sorted list, which does not necessarily reflect the optimal moves by both players.
2. **Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The current implementation assumes that the MEX can be determined by simply counting occurrences and finding gaps, but it doesn't account for the alternating turns and the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.
   - For example, if `a` contains multiple zeros, Alice might strategically pick zeros to delay Bob's ability to minimize the MEX.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It instead calculates a MEX based on a simple counting mechanism, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct based on the problem description and the need to simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: False**
