Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 0 to `n-1`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer `cur` based on the sorted list and the count of unique elements.**
