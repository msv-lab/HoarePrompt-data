#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n with integers (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n with integers (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. Each test case within `arr` remains in its original form but the order of test cases is reversed based on their lexicographical order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer and two lists of integers. It returns the list of test cases sorted in descending lexicographical order, with each test case remaining unchanged.
