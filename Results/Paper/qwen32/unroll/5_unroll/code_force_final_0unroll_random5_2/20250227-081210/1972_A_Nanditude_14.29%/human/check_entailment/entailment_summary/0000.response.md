Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the program step-by-step.

The program's logic is as follows:
- It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, and the two lists `a` and `b`.
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to count the number of new problems added.
- It uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate through `a` and `b` respectively.
- If the current element in `b` is less than the current element in `a`, it removes the last element from `a` and inserts the current element from `b` at the current position in `a`. It increments the counter `cnt` and moves both pointers.
- If the current element in `b` is not less than the current element in `a`, it simply moves both pointers.
- Finally, it prints the counter `cnt`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:
1. The program does not sort the array `a` after inserting the new element from `b`. The problem statement specifies that after inserting a new problem with difficulty `w`, the problems must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The program does not remove the last element from `a` after inserting a new element from `b`. It attempts to do so, but it does not correctly remove the last element and reinsert the new element in the correct position.
3. The function `func_1(arr)` is defined but never used in the program.

The correct approach should be:
- Iterate through both lists `a` and `b`.
- If the current element in `a` is greater than the current element in `b`, insert a new problem with difficulty equal to the current element in `b` into `a`, sort `a`, and remove the last element from `a`. Increment the counter.
- Move both pointers forward.
- If the current element in `a` is not greater than the current element in `b`, simply move both pointers forward.

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
