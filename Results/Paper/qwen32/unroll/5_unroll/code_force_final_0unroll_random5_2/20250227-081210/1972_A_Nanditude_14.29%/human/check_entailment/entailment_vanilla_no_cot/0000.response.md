Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic used to insert new problems and remove the most difficult ones. The program attempts to insert elements from `b` into `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`, but it incorrectly handles the removal and insertion process. Instead of always removing the largest element in `a` and inserting the new problem, it removes the last element and inserts the new problem at the current index `i`, which does not guarantee the correct ordering and solution.

To solve the problem correctly, we should:
1. Use a two-pointer technique to compare elements of `a` and `b`.
2. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, we need to insert a new problem (with difficulty less than or equal to `b[i]`) and remove the largest element from `a`.
3. Keep track of the number of new problems inserted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            a.pop()  # Remove the most difficult problem
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version uses the two-pointer technique and ensures that the largest element is always removed when necessary, maintaining the non-decreasing order of `a`.
