The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts because Python's `range` function will handle the iteration.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is greater than 0. Given that the problem states `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `t` is already guaranteed to be within a valid range for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Since `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to execute. The loop will iterate `t` times regardless of the values of `n` and `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
