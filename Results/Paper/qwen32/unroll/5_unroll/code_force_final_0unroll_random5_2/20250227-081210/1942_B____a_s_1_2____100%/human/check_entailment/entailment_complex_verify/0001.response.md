Let's analyze the program step by step to verify its correctness against the problem description and the annotations provided.

### Problem Recap
Farmer John gives Bessie an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The task is to construct a permutation `p` that satisfies this condition.

### Program Analysis

#### Key Points of the Program
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the length of the array `a`. This is a reasonable starting point because initially, the MEX of an empty array is `0`, but `mex` is set to `n` to ensure it can decrease as elements are assigned to `p`.
2. **Iteration**: The program iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first.
3. **Calculation of `p[i]`**: For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
4. **Update of `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, it updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

#### Annotations and Behavior
- **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is valid.
- **Iteration**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `0`, which is correct since we need to consider the MEX in reverse order.
- **Calculation of `p[i]`**: The formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` is correct based on the problem statement.
- **Update of `mex`**: The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

### Detailed Validation
1. **Correctness of `p[i]` Calculation**:
   - The formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` is derived from the problem statement `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Rearranging this, we get `p[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
   - Since `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not used in `p` up to the current point, this calculation ensures that `p[i]` is a valid candidate for the permutation.

2. **Update of `mex`**:
   - After assigning `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to `min(mex, p[i])`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`, maintaining the MEX property.

3. **Permutation Property**:
   - The program ensures that each `p[i]` is a unique integer between `0` and `n-1` because `mex` is adjusted after each assignment to be the smallest unused integer.
   - Since the program iterates from the end to the beginning, it correctly builds the permutation `p` by ensuring that the MEX property holds at each step.

### Conclusion
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning, calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, and updating `mex` accordingly. The annotations support this reasoning, and there are no apparent issues in the logic.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
