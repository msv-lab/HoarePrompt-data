To understand the output state, let's break down what the loop does for each test case:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the number of elements `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers are read.
2. **Permutation Calculation**: A permutation `p` of length `n` is initialized with `-1`. The variable `mex` (minimum excluded value) is initially set to `n`.
3. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates from the last index to the first index of the list `a`:
   - For each index `i`, `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
   - `mex` is then updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
4. **Output**: The permutation `p` is printed.

The key point to note is that for each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` are re-initialized and computed independently. The values of `t`, which is the number of test cases, remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

After all the test cases have been processed, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `t` remains the same as the initial number of test cases.
- `n`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` are no longer in a defined state because they are re-initialized and modified for each test case.

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, a, p, and mex are not defined as they are re-initialized and modified for each test case.**
