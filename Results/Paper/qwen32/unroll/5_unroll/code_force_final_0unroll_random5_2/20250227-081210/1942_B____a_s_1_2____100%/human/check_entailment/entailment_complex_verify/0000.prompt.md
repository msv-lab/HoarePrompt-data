You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, a, p, and mex are not defined as they are re-initialized and modified for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and outputs a permutation `p` of the list `a` based on a specific calculation involving the minimum excluded value (mex).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The task is to construct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The program provided attempts to construct `p` by iterating from the end of `a` to the beginning and calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, updating `mex` accordingly.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

### Analysis

1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a reasonable starting point since the MEX of an empty array is `0` and it can only increase as elements are added.
2. **Iteration**: The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.
3. **Output**: The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Potential Issues

1. **Correctness of MEX Calculation**: The program updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This is incorrect because `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p` up to that point. The current logic might incorrectly update `mex` to a value that is already present in `p`, which would violate the MEX property.
2. **Handling of Negative Values**: The problem specifies that `a_i` can be negative, but the program does not handle this correctly. If `a[i]` is negative, `p[i]` could be greater than `mex`, which would not satisfy the MEX property.
3. **Ensuring Uniqueness**: The program does not ensure that the constructed `p` is a permutation, i.e., all elements from `0` to `n-1` must be present exactly once.

### Example to Show Incorrectness

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
-1 0 1
```

The program will construct `p` as follows:
- For `i = 2`, `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2` and `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 1`, `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 0 = 2` and `mex = min(2, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 0`, `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 2 - (-1) = 3` and `mex = min(2, 3) = 2`.

The constructed `p` is `[3, 2, 2]`, which is not a valid permutation because it contains duplicate values and a value outside the range `[0, 2]`.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and does not ensure that the constructed `p` is a valid permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
