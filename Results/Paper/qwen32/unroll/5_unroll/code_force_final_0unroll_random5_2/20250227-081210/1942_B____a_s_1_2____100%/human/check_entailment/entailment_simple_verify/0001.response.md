Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to construct a permutation `p` such that for each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p[i]`. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

### Approach Analysis
The program constructs `p` by iterating from the end of `a` to the start. It maintains a variable `mex` which represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a valid starting point because initially, no numbers are used in `p`.

2. **Iterating from the End**: The program iterates from the end of `a` to the start. This is correct because to determine `p[i]`, we need the MEX of `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]`, and by iterating from the end, we correctly build the permutation `p`.

3. **Calculating `p[i]`**: For each `a[i]`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`. This is derived from the problem statement `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p[i]`, so `p[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a[i]`. Since `mex` is the MEX of the current set of `p` values, this formula is correct.

4. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

5. **Output**: The constructed `p` is printed for each test case.

### Annotations Analysis
The annotations provide a state description at key points in the program:
- Before the function call, `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is the length of `p` and `a`, and `a` is the input array.
- `p` is initialized to `[-1] * n`.
- `mex` is initialized to `n`.
- The loop iterates from the end of `a` to the start.
- `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
- `mex` is updated to `min(mex, p[i])`.

The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the logic of the program.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` using the MEX concept in reverse. The approach and implementation are correct, and the program should produce the expected output for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
