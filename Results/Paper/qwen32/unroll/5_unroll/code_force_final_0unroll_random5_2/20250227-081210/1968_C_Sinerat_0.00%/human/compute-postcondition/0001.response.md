To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the given code snippet:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - An integer `n` is read, representing the number of elements in array `a`.
   - A list `x` of `n-1` integers is read.
   - An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element of array `a` is set to 500.
   - For each subsequent element in `a` (from index 1 to n-1), the value is computed as the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
   - The array `a` is then printed.

The output state for each test case is the final state of array `a` after the inner loop completes. Since the outer loop runs `t` times, there will be `t` different output states, one for each test case.

The output state can be described as follows:
- For each test case, the first element of array `a` will always be 500.
- Each subsequent element of array `a` will be the cumulative sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.

Output State: **For each test case, the output is an array `a` of size `n` where `a[0] = 500` and `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**
