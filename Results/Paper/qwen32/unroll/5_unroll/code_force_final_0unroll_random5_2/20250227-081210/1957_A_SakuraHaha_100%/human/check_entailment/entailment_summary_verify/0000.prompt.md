You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads the number of sticks and their lengths for a single test case, counts how many times each stick length appears, and calculates how many complete sets of three sticks of the same length can be formed. It then prints the number of such sets.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. The issue lies in the assumption that a polygon can only be formed if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, and it incorrectly divides the count of each stick length by 3 to determine the number of polygons. This is incorrect because polygons can have more than 3 sides, and the code does not account for this.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

The correct output should be `2` because we can form two equilateral triangles (3-sided polygons) using the 6 sticks of length 2. However, the provided code will output `0` because it divides the count of sticks (6) by 3, resulting in `2`, but then it only considers this as one polygon, not two.

Another example:

```
1
9
4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
```

The correct output should be `3` because we can form three squares (4-sided polygons) using the 9 sticks of length 4. However, the provided code will output `3`, but it does not generalize to other polygon sizes, and it incorrectly assumes that polygons are always 3-sided.

The code needs to be modified to check for all possible polygon sizes (from 3 to n) and determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each size, then take the maximum of these values.
