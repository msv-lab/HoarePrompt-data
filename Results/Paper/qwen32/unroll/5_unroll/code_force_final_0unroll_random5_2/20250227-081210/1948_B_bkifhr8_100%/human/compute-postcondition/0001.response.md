The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is already assigned a value from the input, the state of `n` is the only thing that directly affects whether the loop will execute.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. However, according to the problem statement, `n` is guaranteed to be in the range 2 to 50, so the loop will definitely execute given the constraints. Nonetheless, we should still ensure that `n` is correctly set up before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive**
