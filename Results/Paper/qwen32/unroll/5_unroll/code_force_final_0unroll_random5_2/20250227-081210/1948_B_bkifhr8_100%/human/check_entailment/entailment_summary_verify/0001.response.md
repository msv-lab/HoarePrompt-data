Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap
The goal is to determine if a given integer array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly performing the following operation:
- Select an element of the array that is at least 10.
- Delete this element.
- Insert its digits back into the array in the same position.

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds an element that is smaller than the one before it, it attempts to split the previous element and checks if the resulting array (after insertion of the split digits) can be sorted.

#### Key Points of the Program
1. **Iteration and Comparison**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element is smaller than the previous one.

2. **Splitting and Checking**:
   - If an element is smaller than the previous one, the program splits the previous element into its digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting array (including the split digits and the current element) can be sorted.
   - If the resulting array is not sorted, the program sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the array can be sorted by the described operations, otherwise 'NO'.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary suggests that the function checks if the array can be rearranged by merging adjacent elements such that the digits of the merged elements are in non-decreasing order. However, this is not entirely accurate based on the provided code.

### Issues in the Provided Program
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**:
   - The program only considers splitting the element immediately before the out-of-order element and checks if the resulting array can be sorted. This is not sufficient.
   - The program does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted after multiple splits. It only checks a local condition.
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are required to sort the array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Splits**:
   - The program does not account for the possibility that multiple elements might need to be split to achieve a sorted array.
   - The program does not consider the impact of splitting elements on subsequent elements.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Splitting**:
   - The program splits only when it finds an element that is smaller than the one before it. However, it does not ensure that the split operation will lead to a sorted array.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating through the array and checking if each element can be split to maintain the sorted order.
- Recursively or iteratively attempting to split elements and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
- Ensuring that all possible splits are considered to determine if a sorted array can be achieved.

### Conclusion
Given the issues outlined above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to handle multiple splits and does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted after the operations.

### Final Answer
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Final: **False**
