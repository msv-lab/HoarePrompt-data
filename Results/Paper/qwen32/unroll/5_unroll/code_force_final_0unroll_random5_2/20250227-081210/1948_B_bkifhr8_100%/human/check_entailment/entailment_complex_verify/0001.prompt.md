You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers. For each test case, it checks if the array can be rearranged by merging adjacent elements such that the digits of the merged elements are in non-decreasing order. It outputs 'YES' if such a rearrangement is possible for the array, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The goal is to determine if a given integer array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly performing the following operation:
- Select an element of the array that is at least 10.
- Delete this element.
- Insert its digits back into the array in the same position.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning. If an element is found that is smaller than the one before it, the program tries to split the previous element and checks if the resulting array (after insertion of the split digits) can be sorted. However, this logic is flawed.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**:
   - The program only considers splitting the element immediately before the out-of-order element and checks if the resulting array can be sorted. This is not sufficient.
   - The program does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted after multiple splits. It only checks a local condition.
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are required to sort the array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Splits**:
   - The program does not account for the possibility that multiple elements might need to be split to achieve a sorted array.
   - The program does not consider the impact of splitting elements on subsequent elements.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Splitting**:
   - The program splits only when it finds an element that is smaller than the one before it. However, it does not ensure that the split operation will lead to a sorted array.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating through the array and checking if each element can be split to maintain the sorted order.
- Recursively or iteratively attempting to split elements and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
- Ensuring that all possible splits are considered to determine if a sorted array can be achieved.

### Conclusion
Given the issues outlined above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to handle multiple splits and does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted after the operations.

Correctness: **False**
