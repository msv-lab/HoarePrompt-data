Reasoning:
The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of integers in the player's hand that appear exactly twice. The logic is based on the observation that a player can only score a point if they play a card that has already been played by either player. Since each card number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, the maximum points a player can score is equal to the number of unique card numbers that appear exactly twice in their hand.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of unique integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice. This count represents the maximum number of points the player can score if they play optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to minimize the player's score.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
