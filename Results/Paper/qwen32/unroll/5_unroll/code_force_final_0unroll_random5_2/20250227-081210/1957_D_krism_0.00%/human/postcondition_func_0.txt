The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It calculates a cumulative XOR for the list and uses this to compute a final accumulated value `ans` based on the bit positions of the XOR values. The function prints the original list, the cumulative XOR list, intermediate counts of bits, and finally the accumulated value `ans`.
