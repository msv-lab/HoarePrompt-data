To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, we need to understand the values and structures of the variables `arr` and `prefix` based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the precondition).
2. **`n`**: An integer input provided by the user such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 (though `a` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is part of the precondition).
4. **`arr`**: A list of `n` integers provided by the user such that each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `arr_i` ≤ 10^9.
5. **`prefix`**: A list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`arr`**: This is a list of `n` integers provided by the user. The exact values of the integers in `arr` are not specified in the initial state, so we can only describe `arr` as a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `arr_i` ≤ 10^9.
2. **`prefix`**: This list is constructed as follows:
   - The first element of `prefix` is `0`.
   - Each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point. So, `prefix[1]` is `arr[0]`, `prefix[2]` is `arr[0] ^ arr[1]`, `prefix[3]` is `arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2]`, and so on up to `prefix[n]` which is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement `print(arr, prefix)` will output the entire `arr` list followed by the entire `prefix` list.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the list `arr` followed by the list `prefix`. Since the exact values of the integers in `arr` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of the structure and properties of `arr` and `prefix`.

Output: **[arr_0, arr_1, ..., arr_{n-1}], [0, arr_0, arr_0 ^ arr_1, arr_0 ^ arr_1 ^ arr_2, ..., arr_0 ^ arr_1 ^ ... ^ arr_{n-1}] (where arr_i are the elements of the list arr and each subsequent element of prefix is the cumulative XOR of the elements in arr up to that point)**
