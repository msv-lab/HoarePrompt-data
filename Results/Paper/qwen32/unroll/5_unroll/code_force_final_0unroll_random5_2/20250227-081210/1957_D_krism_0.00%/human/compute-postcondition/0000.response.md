The given code snippet simply prints a string of hyphens. There are no variables or objects in the `print` statement that depend on the initial state or any calculations. The string to be printed is explicitly defined as `'-----------------'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the values and types of variables `t`, `n`, and `a`, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement contains a static string of 17 hyphens.
3. Since there are no variables or conditions that affect the output, the output will always be the same string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-----------------**
