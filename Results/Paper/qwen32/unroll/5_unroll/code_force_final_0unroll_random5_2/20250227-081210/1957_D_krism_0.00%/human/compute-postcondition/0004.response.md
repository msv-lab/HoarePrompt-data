The only variable in the loop head is `v`, which iterates over `arr`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state so that `arr` contains at least one element. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `prefix` do not directly affect the execution of the loop based on the given loop statement.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input provided by the user such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `arr` contains `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `arr_i` ≤ 10^9 and `arr` must have at least 1 element; `prefix` is a list containing a single element, `0`.**
