### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing the specified operations. The logic in the program is based on the observation that if the first and last rows (or the first and last columns) are uniform (all the same color) and different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform through the allowed operations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid, followed by the grid itself.

2. **Grid Representation**: The grid is stored as a list of strings `a`, where each string represents a row of the grid.

3. **First and Last Rows**: The program constructs two strings, `first_row` and `last_row`, which are formed by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.

4. **Condition Check**:
    - The first condition checks if the first row (`a[0]`) and the last row (`a[-1]`) are uniform (all characters the same) and different from each other.
    - The second condition checks if the first column (`first_row`) and the last column (`last_row`) are uniform and different from each other.
    - If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO", indicating that it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
    - Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
    - If the first and last rows are uniform and different, it implies that there is no way to connect the two rows using the allowed operations because any operation would only affect the subrectangle between two selected cells of the same color. Since the first and last rows are different colors, no operation can change this.
    - Similarly, if the first and last columns are uniform and different, it follows the same logic.
    - If neither of these conditions is met, it means that there is a possibility to connect all cells of the grid to a single uniform color through a series of operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given operations. The conditions checked are sufficient to determine the impossibility of making the entire grid uniform when the first and last rows or columns are uniform and different.

**Correctness: True**
