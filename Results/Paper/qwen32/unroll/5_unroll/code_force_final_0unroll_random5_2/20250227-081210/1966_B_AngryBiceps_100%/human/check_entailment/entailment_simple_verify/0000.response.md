### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. The logic in the program only checks the uniformity and equality of the first and last rows and the first and last columns, which is insufficient to determine the possibility of making the entire grid uniform.

To elaborate:

1. **Logic of the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the grid and constructs two strings: `first_row` (by concatenating the first character of each row) and `last_row` (by concatenating the last character of each row).
   - It checks if the first row and the last row are uniform (all characters are the same) and different from each other. If both conditions are met, it prints "NO".
   - It performs a similar check on `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "YES".

2. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the grid:
     ```
     3 3
     BWB
     WBB
     BWB
     ```
   - According to the program:
     - `first_row` would be `BWB`.
     - `last_row` would be `BWB`.
     - Both `first_row` and `last_row` are not uniform and are the same, so the program would print "YES".
   - However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color in this grid using the allowed operations, so the correct output should be "NO".

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct approach is to check if both 'B' and 'W' are present in the grid. If both are present, it is impossible to make all squares the same color, and the program should output "NO". If the grid contains only 'B' or only 'W', the output should be "YES".

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect as it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations.
