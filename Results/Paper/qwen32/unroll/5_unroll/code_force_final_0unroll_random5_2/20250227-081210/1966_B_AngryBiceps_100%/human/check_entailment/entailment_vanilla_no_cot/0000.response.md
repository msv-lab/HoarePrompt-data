Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for all possible configurations of the grid.

The program checks if the first and last rows or the first and last columns are the same and of uniform color, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. There could be other configurations where the grid can be made uniform, but the program would incorrectly output "NO".

For example, consider a grid where all rows are alternating black and white, but the pattern is such that it can be made uniform by selecting appropriate subrectangles. The current program would incorrectly output "NO" for such cases.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to check if there exists a single color that can be used to fill the entire grid by performing the allowed operations. This might involve more complex checks or even a simulation of the operations, but the provided logic is not sufficient.
