Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding

The problem asks if it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Observations

1. **Operation Interpretation**: The operation can be seen as a way to propagate a color across a subrectangle. This means that if you can connect all squares of one color into a single contiguous block, you can eventually make the entire grid that color.

2. **Grid Analysis**: For the grid to be transformed into a single color, there must be a way to connect all squares of that color. If there is a "cross" or "plus" shape of the same color in the grid, it's possible to connect all squares of that color.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the entire grid is already of one color, the answer is "YES".
   - If there is a single row or column that has all the same color, and this color is not the same as the color in the opposite row/column, it might be impossible to connect all squares of that color.

### Program Analysis

The provided program checks the following conditions:

1. **First and Last Row Check**:
   - If the first row is all the same color and the last row is all the same color, and they are different colors, it prints "NO".
   
2. **First and Last Column Check**:
   - If the first column is all the same color and the last column is all the same color, and they are different colors, it prints "NO".
   
3. **General Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis

The program's logic is based on the idea that if the first and last rows (or columns) are different and uniform, it might be impossible to connect all squares of one color to the other. However, this is not a complete and correct approach for all cases.

Here are some counterexamples where the program might fail:

- **Counterexample 1**:
  ```
  2 3
  WBW
  WBW
  ```
  The program would print "NO" because the first and last columns are different and uniform. However, it's possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting the two 'W's in the first row and then the two 'W's in the second row.

- **Counterexample 2**:
  ```
  3 2
  WB
  BW
  WB
  ```
  The program would print "NO" because the first and last rows are different and uniform. However, it's possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting the two 'W's in the first and third rows and then the two 'W's in the second row.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle all cases and might incorrectly print "NO" in scenarios where it's possible to make the entire grid the same color. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
