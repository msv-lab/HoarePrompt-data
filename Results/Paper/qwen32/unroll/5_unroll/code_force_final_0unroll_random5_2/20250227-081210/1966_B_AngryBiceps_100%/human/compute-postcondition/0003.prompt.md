You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters that are either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged and represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the grid is defined by `n` rows and `m` columns, with each cell containing either 'W' or 'B'. The variable `a` stores the grid as a list of strings, where each string represents a row. The strings `first_row` and `last_row` are constructed by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively. The output for each test case is determined by whether all characters in the first and last rows (or columns) are the same and different from each other. If either condition is met, the output is 'NO'; otherwise, it is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and a grid of `n` lines with `m` characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The function returns a result for each test case based on the grid configuration.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
