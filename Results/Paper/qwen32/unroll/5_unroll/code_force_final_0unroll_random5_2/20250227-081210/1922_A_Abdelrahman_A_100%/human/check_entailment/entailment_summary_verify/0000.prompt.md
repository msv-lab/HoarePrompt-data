You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings of equal length. For each test case, it checks if the third string can be formed by selecting characters from the corresponding positions in the first two strings. If it can, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The current logic has several issues:

1. The program checks if `c == a` or `c == b` and prints "NO" if true. However, this is not the correct condition for determining if a template exists. The strings `a` and `b` can be different from `c` in a way that they match a template while `c` does not.

2. The program then iterates through each character in `c` and checks if the character is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If it finds a character in `c` that is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, it incorrectly prints "YES". This check does not consider whether the template conditions are met (i.e., lowercase letters must match and uppercase letters must not match).

3. The program does not consider all possible templates. For a template to exist, for each position `i`:
   - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be the lowercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `c[i]` must not match the chosen lowercase version.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
2
ab
ac
ba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For the template "Ab", string `a` matches because 'a' matches 'A' (uppercase) and 'b' matches 'b' (lowercase).
- String `b` matches because 'a' matches 'A' (uppercase) and 'c' does not match 'b' (lowercase).
- String `c` does not match because 'b' does not match 'A' (uppercase) and 'a' matches 'A' (uppercase).

However, the provided program will print "NO" for this input because it incorrectly checks for the presence of characters in `a` and `b` without considering the template conditions.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
