The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `a`, `b`, `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. However, the variable `tests` is newly introduced and is not mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `a`, `b`, `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
