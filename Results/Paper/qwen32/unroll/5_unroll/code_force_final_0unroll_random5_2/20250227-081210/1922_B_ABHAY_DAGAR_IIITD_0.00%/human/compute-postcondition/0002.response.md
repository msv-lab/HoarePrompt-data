To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the operations performed within the loop.

1. For each test case:
    - Read an integer `n` which represents the number of integers in the list.
    - Read a list of `n` integers.
    - Count the occurrences of each integer in the list using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.
    - Initialize `res` (result for the current test case) to 0 and `total_count` to 0.
    - For each unique count of integers in `num_of_lens`:
        - If the count is 3 or more, add the number of ways to choose 3 items from this count to `res`.
        - If the count is 2 or more, add the number of ways to choose 2 items from this count times the `total_count` to `res`.
        - Update `total_count` by adding the current count.
    - Append the result `res` for the current test case to the `results` list.

Given that the initial state of `results` is an empty list, after processing all test cases, `results` will contain the results of each test case in the order they were processed.

Since the exact test cases are not provided, we can't compute the exact values of `results`. However, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **results is a list containing the computed results for each test case.**
