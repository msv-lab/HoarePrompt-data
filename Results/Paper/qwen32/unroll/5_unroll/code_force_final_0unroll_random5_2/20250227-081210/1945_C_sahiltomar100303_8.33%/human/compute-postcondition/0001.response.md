In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range, the only variable we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `t` directly determines whether the loop will run at all. The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned as part of the test case details, but they are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
