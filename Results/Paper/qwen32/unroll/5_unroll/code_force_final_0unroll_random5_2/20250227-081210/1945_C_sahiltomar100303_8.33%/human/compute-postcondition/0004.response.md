Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` indicating the side preference (0 for left, 1 for right) of each resident. For each test case, it determines and prints the optimal split point in the list of houses such that the number of residents preferring each side is as balanced as possible around this point.**
