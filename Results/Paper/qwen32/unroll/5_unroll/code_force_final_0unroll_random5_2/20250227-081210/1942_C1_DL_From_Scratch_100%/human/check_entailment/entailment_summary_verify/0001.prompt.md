You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the differences between the chosen vertices and the total number of vertices `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and you can choose no more than `y` vertices (which is `0` in this version). The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by forming diagonals between the chosen vertices.

### Key Points

1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We need to form diagonals between the chosen vertices that do not intersect. Each triangle is formed by three vertices connected by diagonals.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - `4 <= n <= 10^9`
   - `2 <= x <= min(n, 2*10^5)`
   - `y = 0` (no additional vertices can be chosen)
3. **Output**: The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Program Analysis

The provided program seems to attempt to solve the problem by:
- Reading the number of test cases `T`.
- For each test case:
  - Reading `n`, `x`, and `y`.
  - Reading the `x` chosen vertices and sorting them.
  - Counting the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices that are exactly 1 (indicating that a triangle can be formed between these vertices and the next one).
  - Handling the gap between the last and the first chosen vertex.
  - Printing the total count of such triangles plus `x - 2`.

### Issues in the Program

The program's logic is flawed, particularly in how it counts the number of triangles. It only considers gaps of exactly 1 between consecutive chosen vertices, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a combinatorial approach:
- Sort the chosen vertices.
- For each triplet of chosen vertices, check if they can form a non-intersecting triangle.
- Count the number of such triplets.

However, a more efficient approach involves using the fact that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed in a polygon with `x` chosen vertices is `x - 2` (this is a known result from combinatorial geometry).

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. It incorrectly assumes that only gaps of exactly 1 between consecutive vertices can form triangles, which is not the case.
