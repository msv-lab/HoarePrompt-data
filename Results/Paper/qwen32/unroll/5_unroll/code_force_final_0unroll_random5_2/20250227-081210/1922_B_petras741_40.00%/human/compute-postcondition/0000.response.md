The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case are not affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
