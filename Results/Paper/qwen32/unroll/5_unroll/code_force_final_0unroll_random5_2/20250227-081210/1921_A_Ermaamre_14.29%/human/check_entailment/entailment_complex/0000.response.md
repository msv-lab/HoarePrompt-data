### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to read the coordinates of the corners of a square and calculate its area. It does this by identifying pairs of coordinates that share the same x-values (which correspond to the vertical sides of the square) and then calculating the distance between the y-values of these pairs to determine the side length of the square. The area is then calculated as the square of this side length.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
3. It checks which pairs of coordinates share the same x-values. This is done using three `if` conditions to cover all possible pairings of the four corners.
4. Once it identifies the correct pair of coordinates that share the same x-values, it calculates the absolute difference between their y-values to determine the side length of the square.
5. It then squares this side length to get the area of the square and prints it.

The logic in the program correctly identifies the side length of the square and calculates the area. The conditions used to identify the pairs of coordinates sharing the same x-values cover all possible configurations of the square's corners.

### Verification with the Example:
Let's verify the program's correctness using the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
```
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
- The pairs with the same x-values are (1, 2) and (1, 5), and (4, 5) and (4, 2).
- The side length is the difference in y-values of these pairs, which is \(|5 - 2| = 3\).
- The area is \(3^2 = 9\).

#### Test Case 2:
```
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```
- The pairs with the same x-values are (-1, 1) and (-1, -1), and (1, -1) and (1, 1).
- The side length is the difference in y-values of these pairs, which is \(|1 - (-1)| = 2\).
- The area is \(2^2 = 4\).

#### Test Case 3:
```
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```
- The pairs with the same x-values are (45, 11) and (45, 39), and (17, 11) and (17, 39).
- The side length is the difference in y-values of these pairs, which is \(|39 - 11| = 28\).
- The area is \(28^2 = 784\).

The program's output matches the expected output for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the area of the square for each set of input coordinates. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
