Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string based on the given problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - Construct a string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on).

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given the encoded string `b`, we need to reverse the encoding process to get back the original string `s`.
   - This involves:
     - Identifying the distinct characters in `b` and sorting them to reconstruct `r`.
     - Mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the last character of `r` is mapped to the first, the second from the end to the second, and so on).

### Program Analysis:
Let's dissect the provided code and see if it correctly implements the decoding process.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic in `func_1(b)`:**
   - **Creating the Character Map:**
     - The program creates a set of distinct characters from `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
     - It then constructs a mapping (`char_map`) where each character `c` in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the last character of `r` is mapped to the first, the second from the end to the second, and so on).
     - However, the mapping logic in the code is incorrect:
       - The code uses `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` to map each character, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Instead, it should map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r` directly.
       - The correct mapping should be: `char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]`, where `r` is the sorted list of distinct characters from `b`.

3. **Reconstructing the Original String:**
   - The program then constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.
   - However, due to the incorrect mapping logic, the reconstructed string `s` will not be correct.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` because the mapping logic is incorrect. The mapping should directly map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`, not to a character derived from the ASCII value.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create a sorted list of distinct characters in b
    r = sorted(set(b))
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    char_map = {r[i]: r[len(r) - i - 1] for i in range(len(r))}
    # Reconstruct the original string s
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

This corrected function should properly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.
