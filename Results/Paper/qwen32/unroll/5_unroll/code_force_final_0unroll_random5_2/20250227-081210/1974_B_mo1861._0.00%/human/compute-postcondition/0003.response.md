To understand the output state, let's break down the provided loop:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - `sorted(set(b))` first removes duplicate characters from `b` and then sorts the remaining characters in ascending order.
   - `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))` generates pairs of index `i` and character `c` from the sorted unique characters.
   - For each character `c` at index `i`, the loop assigns a new character to `char_map[c]`. The new character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

3. **Character Mapping**:
   - `ord('a')` gives the ASCII value of 'a'.
   - `(len(b) - i - 1)` calculates the offset from 'a' for the new character. This means the first character in the sorted unique list will be mapped to the last letter of the alphabet, the second to the second last, and so on.

4. **Resulting `char_map`**:
   - After the loop, `char_map` will contain mappings from each unique character in `b` to a character in the range from 'a' to 'z', starting from 'z' and moving backwards.

**Output State**: **`char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `b` to a character from 'z' to 'a' in descending order based on the sorted unique characters of `b`.**

This means if `b` was "abc", `char_map` would be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`. If `b` was "bca", `char_map` would still be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}` because the unique characters are sorted to "abc" before mapping.
