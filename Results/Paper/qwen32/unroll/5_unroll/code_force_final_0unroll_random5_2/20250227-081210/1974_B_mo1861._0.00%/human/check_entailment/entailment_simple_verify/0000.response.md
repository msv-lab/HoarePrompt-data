Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the annotations to determine if the program correctly decodes the encoded string.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Encoding Process**:
   - Construct a string `r` from the distinct characters of `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - Given the encoded string `b`, reconstruct the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process.

### Provided Program Code:
```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Annotations:
- The program constructs a mapping where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically based on the reverse order of the unique characters sorted in ascending order.
- The program then uses this mapping to decode the string `b`.

### Analysis:

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Constructing `char_map`**:
   - `sorted(set(b))` creates a list of unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically.
   - `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))` provides the index and character of each unique character.
   - `char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` incorrectly maps each character to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically, which is not the correct symmetric character mapping based on the original string `s`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The loop `for c in b: s += char_map[c]` constructs the decoded string `s` using the incorrect mapping.

#### Issues with the Provided Code:
- The code does not correctly map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of characters from the original string `s`. Instead, it maps characters to a sequence starting from 'a', which is not the intended symmetric mapping.

### Counterexample to Validate:
Consider the input:
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```
- The distinct characters in `serofedsoc` are `cdefors`.
- The symmetric mapping should be: `s -> c`, `e -> o`, `r -> d`, `o -> e`, `f -> f`, `d -> r`, `s -> c`, `e -> o`, `s -> c`, `o -> e`.
- Therefore, the decoded string `s` should be `codeforces`.

However, the provided code would incorrectly map characters based on the sequence starting from 'a', leading to an incorrect decoded string.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The code incorrectly maps each character in the encoded string `b` to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically, rather than mapping to the symmetric character in the sorted set of characters from the original string `s`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
