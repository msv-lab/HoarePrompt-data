### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine the minimum possible penalty for splitting a given string `s` into non-empty subarrays based on the rules described in the problem. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty as intended.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The current implementation splits the string `s` by the character `-` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts. This approach does not guarantee an optimal split that minimizes the penalty.
   - The optimal split depends on the balance between `+` and `-` in each subarray, not just the lengths of the parts separated by `-`.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates a count of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This logic does not correctly compute the penalty as described in the problem.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the goal is to minimize the total penalty across all subarrays.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `"+--++-"`, the optimal split would be `["+--", "++", "-"]` with penalties `|1-1-1|*3 + |1+1|*2 + |-1|*1 = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8`. However, the provided program does not compute this correctly.

### Correctness:

Given the issues described, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as intended. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
