### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to split the array `a` (derived from the string `s` where `+` maps to `1` and `-` to `-1`) into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal split that minimizes this total penalty.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Splitting Strategy**:
   - The program splits the string `s` based on the character `-` and calculates the length of the parts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - `parts = expression.split('-')` splits the string at every `-`, which is not a strategy to minimize penalty as it does not consider the balance of `+` and `-` within the subarrays.

2. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` tries to count the number of times the balance (sum of the subarray) becomes negative and resets it. However, this does not correctly compute the penalty for each subarray or find the optimal split.
   - The function `func_1` only increments `count` when `balance < 0` and resets `balance` to 0. It then adds `(balance > 0)` to `count` at the end, which is not a correct way to calculate the penalty.

3. **Optimal Splitting**:
   - The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty involves finding splits where the subarrays have a sum as close to zero as possible, thereby minimizing the penalty.
   - The provided program does not consider all possible splits and their penalties, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

#### Annotated Code Analysis
- The annotation shows the state of the program right before the function call: `expression` is a string consisting of characters `+` and `-`, and `length` is a positive integer such that `length` equals the length of the string `expression`.
- Inside `func_1`, the state shows `expression` is `"+--++-"`, `length` is `6`, `count` is `1`, and `balance` is `1`. The program returns `2`, which is not the correct minimum penalty for this input.

#### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider a dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that optimally splits the array based on the penalty calculation. Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum penalty for the subarray `a[0:i]`.
   - Iterate through the array and for each position `i`, consider all possible subarrays ending at `i` and calculate their penalties.
   - Update the `dp` array with the minimum penalty found.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Traverse the array and keep a running balance.
   - Whenever the balance becomes zero, split the array at that point because the penalty for such a subarray is zero.
   - If the balance does not become zero, continue until the end of the array and calculate the penalty for the remaining subarray.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for the problem. It fails to consider all possible splits and their penalties, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
