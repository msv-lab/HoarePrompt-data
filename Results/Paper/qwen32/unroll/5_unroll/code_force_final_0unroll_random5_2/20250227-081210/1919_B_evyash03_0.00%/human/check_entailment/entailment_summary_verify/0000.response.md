### Reasoning

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem statement, the given code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to split the string `s` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the concatenation of these subarrays equals the original array `a`.
- The penalty for each subarray `b_i` is defined as `|sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`.
- The goal is to find the minimum possible total penalty.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of `+` and `-` characters. For each string, it calculates the result using the function `func_1(expression, length)`. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimum penalty.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` calculates the number of times the balance of `+` and `-` characters in the string `expression` goes negative, resets it to zero, and finally adds one if there is a positive balance left. The function returns this calculated value.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the penalty as defined in the problem statement. It only counts transitions where the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which does not reflect the penalty calculation `|sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Subarrays**:
   - The program does not correctly identify and split the array into subarrays that minimize the total penalty. For example, in the test case `+-+-+-`, the correct optimal split is `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` which results in a penalty of `0`, but the program does not achieve this.

3. **Example of Failure**:
   - For the test case `n = 6` with the string `+-+-+-`, the correct optimal split is `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` with a penalty of `0`.
   - The provided program will output `3` because it counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which is not the correct penalty calculation.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Evaluate all possible ways to split the string `s` into subarrays.
- For each split, calculate the penalty for each subarray as `|sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`.
- Sum the penalties for all subarrays in a given split.
- Track the minimum total penalty across all possible splits.

The provided program does not follow this approach and hence is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
