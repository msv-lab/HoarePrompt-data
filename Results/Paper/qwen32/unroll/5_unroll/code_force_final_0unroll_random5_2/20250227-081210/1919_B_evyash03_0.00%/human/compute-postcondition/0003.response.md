To determine the output state, we need to simulate the execution of the given loop with the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `expression`: a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
- `length`: the length of the string `expression`.
- `count`: 0
- `balance`: 0

### Loop Code:
1. The loop iterates over each character in `expression`.
2. If the character is '+', it increments `balance` by 1.
3. If the character is '-', it decrements `balance` by 1.
4. If `balance` becomes less than 0, it increments `count` by 1 and resets `balance` to 0.

### Analysis:
- `balance` keeps track of the cumulative sum of '+' and '-' operations.
- `count` increments each time `balance` goes negative, meaning there are more '-' operations than '+' operations up to that point, and then `balance` is reset to 0.

### Output State:
- `expression` remains unchanged because it is only read, not modified.
- `length` remains unchanged because it is derived from `expression` and not modified.
- `count` reflects the number of times `balance` went negative.
- `balance` reflects the final cumulative sum of '+' and '-' operations after all adjustments.

### Example:
Let's assume `expression` is "+--++-".

1. `char = '+'`: `balance = 1`
2. `char = '-'`: `balance = 0`
3. `char = '-'`: `balance = -1` â†’ `count = 1`, `balance = 0`
4. `char = '+'`: `balance = 1`
5. `char = '+'`: `balance = 2`
6. `char = '-'`: `balance = 1`

After the loop:
- `expression`: "+--++-"
- `length`: 6
- `count`: 1
- `balance`: 1

Output State: **expression is "+--++-", length is 6, count is 1, balance is 1.**
