Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if there are any two consecutive elements in the list `p` that are in a specific swapped order. If such a pair is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.**
