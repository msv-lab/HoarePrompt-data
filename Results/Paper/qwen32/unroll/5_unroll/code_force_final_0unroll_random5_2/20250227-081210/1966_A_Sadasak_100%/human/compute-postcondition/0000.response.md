Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number on a card, and `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange in each operation. The length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

The `frequency_table` variable is initialized as an empty dictionary, and all other variables remain unchanged.
