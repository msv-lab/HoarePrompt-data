Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a value `k` (not used in the function), a list of monsters' health values `a_i`, and a list of their positions `x_i`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the available bullets within the time constraints, where the time constraint for each monster is the absolute value of its position. It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values.**
