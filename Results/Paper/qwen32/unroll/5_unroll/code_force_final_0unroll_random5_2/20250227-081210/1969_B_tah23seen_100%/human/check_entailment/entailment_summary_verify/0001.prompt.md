You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the total cost based on the pattern of '0's following '1's in a given binary string `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations.

First, let's understand the logic behind the provided function:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over each character in the binary string `s`.
2. It keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far with the variable `one`.
3. Whenever a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

The key insight here is that the cost `one + 1` is added every time a '0' follows one or more '1's because to move the '0' to the left of all the '1's encountered so far, we would need to perform a series of cyclic shifts on the substring that includes all these '1's and the '0'. The cost of each such operation is the length of the substring, which is `one + 1` (since it includes the '0' and all the '1's encountered so far).

Let's verify this with the example cases provided in the problem:

1. For the string "10":
   - The first character is '1', so `one` becomes 1.
   - The second character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1` = 2.
   - The final cost is 2, which matches the expected output.

2. For the string "0000":
   - The string is already sorted, so no operations are needed, and the cost remains 0.
   - The final cost is 0, which matches the expected output.

3. For the string "11000":
   - The first two characters are '1's, so `one` becomes 2.
   - The third character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1` = 3.
   - The next two characters are '0's, but since there are no more '1's encountered, the cost does not change.
   - The final cost is 3, but the expected output is 9. This suggests that the function does not correctly calculate the cost for this case.

Let's analyze the third example in more detail:

- The optimal strategy involves multiple operations:
  1. Choose substring [1, 3]: 11000 -> 01100 (cost 3)
  2. Choose substring [2, 4]: 01100 -> 00110 (cost 3)
  3. Choose substring [3, 5]: 00110 -> 00011 (cost 3)
- The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

The function `func_1` does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of multiple operations needed to sort the string. It only adds the cost of the first '0' encountered after '1's and does not consider subsequent operations.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is incorrect for some cases, specifically for cases where multiple operations are needed to sort the string.

Reasoning: The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost for all cases, particularly when multiple operations are required to sort the string.

Correctness: **False**
