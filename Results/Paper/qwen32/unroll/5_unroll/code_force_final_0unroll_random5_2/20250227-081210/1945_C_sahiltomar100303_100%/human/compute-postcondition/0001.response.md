The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `n` and the string `a` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s**
