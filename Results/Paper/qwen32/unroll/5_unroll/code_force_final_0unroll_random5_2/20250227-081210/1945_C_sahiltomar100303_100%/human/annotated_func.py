#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses in the village, and a string a of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

    #State: t printed values, each being the optimal split point for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints the optimal split point for each test case, which is the number of houses that should be on the left side of the street to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side of the street want to live there.
