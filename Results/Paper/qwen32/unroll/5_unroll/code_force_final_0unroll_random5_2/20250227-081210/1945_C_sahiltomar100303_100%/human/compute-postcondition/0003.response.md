Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of houses in the village (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s. Each character in the string `a` indicates the side of the street the resident of the corresponding house wants to live on (0 for the left side, 1 for the right side). The function returns the number of houses that want to live on the left side of the street.**
