Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D".**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The constraints on `t` (1 <= `t` <= 100) remain the same. The other variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this line of code and retain their initial descriptions.
