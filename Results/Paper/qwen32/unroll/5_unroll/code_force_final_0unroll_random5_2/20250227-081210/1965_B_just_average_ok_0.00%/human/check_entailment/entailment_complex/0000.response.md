### Reasoning:
The given Python program aims to construct a sequence `a` for each test case that meets the following criteria:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The program initializes `nums` with the powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., \(2^{23}\)).
   - These powers of 2 are chosen because they can be combined in different ways to form any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\).

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - The program finds the highest power of 2 that is less than `k` by iterating through the powers of 2.
   - This is done using the `idx` variable, which is incremented until \(2^{idx} \geq k\).

3. **Modification of `nums`**:
   - The program removes the power of 2 at the found `idx` position.
   - It then adds three new elements to `nums`: 
     - `k - nums[idx]` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - `k + 1` to cover the sum `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1` to cover sums greater than `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified `nums` list.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Verification:
- **Coverage of Sums**:
  - The initial powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to \(2^{24} - 1\) can be formed.
  - By removing the power of 2 at the `idx` position and adding the new elements, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while still being able to form all other sums up to `n`.

- **Constraints**:
  - The size of the `nums` list remains at most 25, meeting the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
