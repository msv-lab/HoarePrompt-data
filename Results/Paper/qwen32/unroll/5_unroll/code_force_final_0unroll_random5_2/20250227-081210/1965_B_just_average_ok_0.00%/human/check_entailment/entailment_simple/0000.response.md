### Reasoning:

The provided program generates a sequence for each test case based on the given values of `n` and `k`. The goal is to ensure that there is no subsequence of the generated sequence that sums to `k`, while there is a subsequence that sums to every other integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`).

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)). This is a common approach to cover a wide range of sums efficiently, as sums of subsets of powers of 2 can represent any non-negative integer up to \(2^{24} - 1\).

2. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program finds the highest index `idx` such that \(2^{idx} \leq k\). This helps determine which power of 2 is the largest one less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Adjusting the Sequence**:
   - The program then appends three new elements to the `nums` list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed, as removing `nums[idx]` from `k` should not result in a sum that can be formed by the remaining elements.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that the sum `k + 1` can be formed, which is necessary to cover all sums up to `n`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This further ensures that sums greater than `k` can be formed.
   - The program removes the element `2^{idx}` from the list to prevent the formation of the sum `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Coverage of Sums**:
  - The initial list of powers of 2 allows for covering a wide range of sums efficiently.
  - The additional elements (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`) ensure that sums around `k` are handled correctly.
  - The removal of `2^{idx}` prevents the formation of the sum `k`.

- **Constraints**:
  - The program ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25, which meets the problem's constraints.
  - The generated sequence is valid for all test cases within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be formed.

**Correctness: True**
