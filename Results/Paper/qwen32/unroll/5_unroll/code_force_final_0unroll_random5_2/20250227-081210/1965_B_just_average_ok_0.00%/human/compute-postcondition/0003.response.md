Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs and modifies a list of numbers based on the value of `k`, then outputs the length of the modified list followed by its elements. The initial values of `n` and `k` for each test case remain unchanged.**
