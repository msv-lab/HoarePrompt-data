You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output consists of two lines: the first line is the length of the modified `nums` list, and the second line contains the space-separated elements of the modified `nums` list. The initial state of `t` (number of test cases) and the values of `n` for each test case remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs and modifies a list of numbers based on the value of `k`, then outputs the length of the modified list followed by its elements. The initial values of `n` and `k` for each test case remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not guarantee that there is no subsequence of the sequence `a` that sums to `k`. Let's analyze the code and identify the issue.

The code generates a sequence using powers of 2 and then modifies it by adding and removing elements to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`. However, the approach does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `k` is small or when the sequence generated does not cover all necessary conditions.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
- A sequence of size at most 25 such that:
  - No subsequence sums to 2.
  - Subsequences sum to 1 and 3.

**Possible Correct Output:**
```
2
1 3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program generates a sequence that includes powers of 2 and additional elements to avoid the sum `k`. However, the specific sequence generated may not satisfy the conditions for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

**Issue in the Program:**
The program does not systematically ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`. Instead, it adds and removes specific elements, which may not be sufficient for all cases. For example, in the test case `n=3` and `k=2`, the program might generate a sequence that includes `2` or allows a subsequence to sum to `2`.

To ensure correctness, a more systematic approach is needed, such as using a greedy algorithm to build the sequence while avoiding the sum `k` and ensuring all other sums are possible.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to the potential failure to meet the conditions for all possible inputs.
