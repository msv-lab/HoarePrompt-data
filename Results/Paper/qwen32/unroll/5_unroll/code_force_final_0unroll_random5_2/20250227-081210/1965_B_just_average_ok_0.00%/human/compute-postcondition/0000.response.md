The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value that `input()` will return, which should be an integer representing the number of iterations.

Since the loop head does not directly involve `t`, `n`, or `k`, we only need to ensure that the input value is such that the loop can execute. Given that `t` is the number of test cases and it is provided in the problem statement, we need to ensure that `input()` returns `t`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `input()` returns `t`**
