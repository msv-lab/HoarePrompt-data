Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for that test case; `inf` is 200001; `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is assigned the value of the integer input by the user. The other variables (`n` and `inf`) retain their initial descriptions and values.
