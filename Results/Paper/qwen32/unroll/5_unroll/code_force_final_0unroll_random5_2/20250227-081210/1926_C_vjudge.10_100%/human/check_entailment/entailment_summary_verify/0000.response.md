### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the code: the function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will indeed cause a `NameError` in Python. This is a straightforward syntax error that makes the code non-executable as presented.

However, the original assessment also mentions a potential concern about the precomputation of the `values` list up to a fixed limit (`inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`). It notes that the problem constraints ensure `n` will not exceed `2 * 10 ** 5`, so this particular issue does not affect the correctness of the solution within the given constraints.

The original assessment concludes that the code is incorrect due to the syntax error. This conclusion is accurate based on the provided code snippet.

### Final Evaluation:

Since the original assessment correctly identifies the primary issue (the incorrect placement of the function call and definition), the assessment is accurate. The code, as written, will not execute due to the syntax error.

Final: **False**
