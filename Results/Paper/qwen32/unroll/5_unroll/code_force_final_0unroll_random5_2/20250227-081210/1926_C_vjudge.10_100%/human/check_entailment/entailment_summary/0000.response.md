Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5. This allows it to quickly answer each test case by simply looking up the precomputed value. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (2 * 10^5 + 1) to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to each index.
2. It iterates from 1 to `inf` (exclusive), computes the sum of the digits for each number `i`, and updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i-1]` and the digit sum of `i`.
3. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, and outputs `values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem efficiently. The precomputation step ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time, making the solution suitable within the given time constraints.

Given the execution summary and the program's behavior, it appears to correctly handle the input and produce the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
