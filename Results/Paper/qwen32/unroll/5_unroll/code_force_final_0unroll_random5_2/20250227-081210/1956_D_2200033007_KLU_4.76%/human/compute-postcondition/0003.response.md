The provided initial state includes details about the list `c` and the variable `m`, but the print statement does not reference these variables. Instead, it prints a formatted string that contains the literal values '1' and '2'.

Here's the breakdown:
- The print statement is: `print(f'1 2')`
- The `f` before the string indicates that it is an f-string, but in this case, it does not contain any variables to be formatted into the string. It simply contains the characters '1' and '2' separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be the exact string '1 2'.

Output: **1 2**
