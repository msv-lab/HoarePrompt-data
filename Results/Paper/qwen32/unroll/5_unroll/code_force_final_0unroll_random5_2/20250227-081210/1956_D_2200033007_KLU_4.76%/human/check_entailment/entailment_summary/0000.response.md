Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` from the input. However, it does not convert the elements of the array from strings to integers. This will cause errors when performing operations on the array elements.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` takes the length of the array `c` as a parameter, but it should take the array itself. The logic inside `func_1` is hardcoded to print specific outputs based on whether `c` (which is the length of the array, not the array itself) is equal to 2. This logic does not implement the actual solution to the problem.

3. **Hardcoded Outputs**: The function prints hardcoded outputs for specific cases without actually computing the maximum sum and the sequence of operations required to achieve it. For example, it always prints "4 1\n1 2" if `c` is 2, which is not correct for all cases. It also prints "13 0" for any other case, which is also incorrect.

4. **No Implementation of MEX Calculation**: The program does not implement the MEX calculation or the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations.

5. **No Handling of Different Array Lengths**: The program does not handle arrays of different lengths or values correctly, as it only has hardcoded outputs for specific cases.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
