### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input but does not convert the elements of the array `a` to integers. This will cause issues when performing operations that require integer arithmetic.
   - Specifically, the line `a.append(ai)` should be `a.append(int(ai))` to ensure that the elements of `a` are integers.

2. **Incorrect Function Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to take the length of the array `c` as an argument and perform operations to maximize the sum of the array. However, the function does not use the array `a` in any way.
   - The function only checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints hardcoded values. For all other lengths, it prints `13 0`, which is incorrect for many cases.

3. **Hardcoded Values:**
   - The hardcoded values for the output do not generalize to all possible input cases. For example:
     - For an input of `4` followed by `1 100 2 1`, the correct output should be `105 2` with specific operations, but the program outputs `13 0`.
     - For an input of `1` followed by `0`, the correct output should be `1 1` with the operation `1 1`, but the program outputs `13 0`.

4. **Lack of MEX Calculation:**
   - The program does not calculate the MEX (minimum excluded value) for any subarray of `a` and does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the original assessment is correct. The program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem and fails to meet the requirements for many potential cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
