Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and prints hardcoded values, which does not generalize to all possible input cases. 

For example:
- If the input is `4` followed by `1 100 2 1`, the program will print `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `105 2` as shown in the problem description.
- If the input is `1` followed by `0`, the program will print `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1 1` followed by `1 1`.

The program does not compute the MEX of any subarray and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for many potential cases.
