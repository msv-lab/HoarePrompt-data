The provided Python code snippet includes a `print` statement that outputs a formatted string. The string is `'13 0'` and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `c`, `m`, and any other variables mentioned in the initial state do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `c` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 18, and each element in `c` is between 0 and 10^7.
   - `m` is initialized to 0.
   - There is a condition that `c` is not equal to 2, which seems to be a misstatement since `c` is a list and cannot be equal to an integer. This condition does not affect the `print` statement.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement `print(f'13 0')` is executed.
   - The string `'13 0'` is directly printed without any dependency on the variables `c` or `m`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'13 0'`.

Output: **13 0**
