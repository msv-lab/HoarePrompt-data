The only variable in the loop head is `ch`, and the loop iterates over each character `ch` in the `password` string. The loop will execute as long as `password` is a non-empty string. Given that the state before the loop starts specifies that `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, the loop will definitely execute without any need to adjust the `password` string.

Since the loop head only involves `ch` and `password`, and `password` is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute, no adjustments are needed to the state of `password` or `ch`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list**
