You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, and `letters` is sorted.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific criteria: all letters must be in alphabetical order, all digits must be in ascending order, and no letter should be immediately followed by a digit. If the password meets these criteria, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly. Specifically, the code does not ensure that all digits are sorted and all letters are sorted when they are the only characters in the password. However, the code already checks if the letters and digits are sorted when they are present, which is correct.

The primary issue lies in the condition where the password contains only letters or only digits. The code should still return "YES" in these cases if the letters or digits are sorted, which they inherently are because a single character or a sequence of identical characters is trivially sorted.

However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where the password is entirely made up of digits or letters. Although the current implementation will still return "YES" for such cases because the sorting check will pass (a single list of characters is always sorted with itself), it is not explicitly clear from the code that this is the intended behavior.

To ensure clarity and correctness, we can add explicit checks for these cases. However, the current code does not fail on these specific cases, so the primary issue is more about code clarity and explicitness rather than correctness for the given problem description.

Despite this, the code does not have any logical errors that would cause it to return incorrect results for the given problem description. Therefore, it is correct for the given problem description.

However, to be thorough, let's consider the following edge cases:

1. Password with only one character (either a letter or a digit).
2. Password with all identical characters (either all letters or all digits).
3. Password with a mix of letters and digits where digits follow letters.

The code handles all these cases correctly. Therefore, the program is indeed correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if the letters and digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order and ensures that no digit comes after a letter. It handles all edge cases, including passwords consisting only of letters or only of digits, correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
