Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends).
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Logic in `func_1` function:**
   - **Separating Letters and Digits:**
     - The program iterates over each character in the password.
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   
   - **Checking Sorted Order:**
     - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
     - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   
   - **Checking the Order of Letters and Digits:**
     - It iterates over the password string to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If it finds such a case, it returns `'NO'`.
   
   - If all the above checks pass, it returns `'YES'`.

### Verification Against the Problem Requirements:
1. **Condition 1:**
   - The program assumes the input is valid, i.e., it only contains lowercase Latin letters and digits as per the problem description. Hence, this condition is implicitly satisfied.

2. **Condition 2:**
   - The program checks that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and comparing consecutive characters.

3. **Condition 3:**
   - The program checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.

4. **Condition 4:**
   - The program checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions outlined in the problem statement. It handles each test case appropriately based on the given criteria.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
