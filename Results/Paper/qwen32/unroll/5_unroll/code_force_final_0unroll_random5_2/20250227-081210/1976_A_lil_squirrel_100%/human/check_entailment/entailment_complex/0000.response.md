### Reasoning:

1. **Condition Check for Letters:**
   - The program separates the letters and digits from the password and stores them in the `letters` and `digits` lists, respectively.
   - It then checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(letters)`. If not, it returns "NO".

2. **Condition Check for Digits:**
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(digits)`. If not, it returns "NO".

3. **Condition Check for Letter-Digit Sequence:**
   - The program iterates through the password to ensure that no letter is followed by a digit. If it finds such a sequence, it returns "NO".

4. **Final Decision:**
   - If all the above conditions are satisfied, the program returns "YES".

The provided program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description:
- The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits (this is ensured by the problem constraints and the nature of the input).
- There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
- All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Correctness:
The program correctly checks all the conditions and returns the appropriate output based on whether the password meets the criteria for being strong. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
