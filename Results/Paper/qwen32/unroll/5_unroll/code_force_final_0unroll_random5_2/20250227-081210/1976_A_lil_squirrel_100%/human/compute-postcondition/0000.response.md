The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `letters`. This action does not affect the values of `n` or `password`. Therefore, the output state remains with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `password` being a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The new variable `letters` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list.**
