Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong according to the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of the checks:

1. **Separation of Letters and Digits:** The program iterates through each character in the password and separates them into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.

2. **Sorting Check:** It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order and if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, the program returns 'NO'.

3. **Order Check:** It then checks if any letter is immediately followed by a digit in the password. If such a case is found, the program returns 'NO'.

4. **Return 'YES':** If the password passes all the above checks, the program returns 'YES'.

The program handles all the given conditions and the logic aligns with the problem statement. The execution summary also confirms that the function behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
