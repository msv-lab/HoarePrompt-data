Reasoning:  
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the provided problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program then checks the following conditions:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".
4. This logic accurately corresponds to the definitions of a stair and a peak as described in the problem statement.

The program handles the input and output requirements correctly, and it processes each test case independently.

Correctness: **True**
