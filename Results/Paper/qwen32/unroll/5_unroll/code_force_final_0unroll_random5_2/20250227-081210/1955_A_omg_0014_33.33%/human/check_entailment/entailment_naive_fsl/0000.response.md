Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

The code reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (`a`), the price for one yogurt (`b`), and the price for two yogurts (`c`). However, the logic to calculate the minimum cost is incorrect.

Here's the problematic logic:
```python
d = c / 2
if a * b < a * d:
    print(a * b)
else:
    print(round(a * d))
```
The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is not used correctly in the logic. The intention seems to be to compare whether buying individual yogurts or buying them in pairs is cheaper.

The correct approach should be:
1. Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought (`n // 2`).
2. Calculate the cost for these pairs (`(n // 2) * c`).
3. Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurt, if any (`(n % 2) * b`).
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total minimum cost.

Let's consider a test case where the program would fail:
- Input: `1 3 5 11`
- Expected Output: `15`
- Program Output: `15` (which is correct in this specific case, but let's consider another case)

Another test case:
- Input: `1 4 5 11`
- Expected Output: `20`
- Program Output: `10` (which is incorrect)

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = (pairs * b) + (remaining * a)
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly by considering the number of pairs and the remaining yogurts separately.
