Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, and `a`, `b`, `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `l` is 'YES'**.

In this output state, the variable `l` has been assigned the value 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
