### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-examine the problem statement and the provided program code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap

The task is to minimize the total penalty when splitting the array derived from a string of `+` and `-` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

#### Provided Program Code

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)
```

#### Annotations

- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `s` (which is incorrectly interpreted as the length of the string), then reads the string `e`.
- It counts the number of `+`s (`P`) and `-`s (`M`) in the string `e`.
- It prints the difference `P - M`.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The line `s = int(input())` is incorrect because `s` should be the length of the string `e`, and it is not used correctly in the program.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic `print(P - M)` does not compute the minimum penalty. It merely computes the difference between the counts of `+` and `-`, which is not related to the penalty calculation as described in the problem.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where each `+` is `1` and each `-` is `-1`.
- Find an optimal way to split `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
- The penalty for each subarray is `|sum(subarray)| * len(subarray)`.

The provided program does none of this. It simply counts the `+` and `-` characters and outputs their difference, which is not related to the penalty calculation.

#### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
