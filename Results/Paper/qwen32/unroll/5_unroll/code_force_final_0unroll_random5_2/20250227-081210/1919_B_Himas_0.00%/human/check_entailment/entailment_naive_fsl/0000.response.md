Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and outputs their difference, which is not related to the penalty calculation described.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find an optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        s = input[index + 1]
        index += 2
        a = [1 if c == '+' else -1 for c in s]
        current_sum = 0
        penalty = 0
        for num in a:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum == 0:
                penalty += abs(current_sum) * len(a[:a.index(num) + 1])
                a = a[a.index(num) + 1:]
                current_sum = 0
        if current_sum != 0:
            penalty += abs(current_sum) * len(a)
        results.append(penalty)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program reads the input, processes each test case by converting the string `s` into the array `a`, and then finds the optimal way to split `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. It calculates the penalty for each subarray and sums them up to get the final result.

The original program fails to implement this logic and instead performs an incorrect operation, hence it is incorrect.
