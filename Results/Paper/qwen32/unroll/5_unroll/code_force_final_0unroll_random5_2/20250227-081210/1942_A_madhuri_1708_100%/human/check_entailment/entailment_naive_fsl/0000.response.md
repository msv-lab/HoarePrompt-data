Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the program and identify the issues:

1. **Handling of `k == 1`:**
   - The program correctly generates an array for `k == 1` by printing the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   
2. **Handling of `k >= 2` and `n == k`:**
   - The program correctly generates an array for `k == n` by printing an array where all elements are the same, e.g., `[k, k, ..., k]`. This ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   
3. **Handling of `k >= 2` and `n != k`:**
   - The program incorrectly outputs `-1` in this case. However, there are valid arrays that can satisfy these conditions. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 1, 2, 3]`. Here, the cyclic shifts are:
     - `[1, 1, 2, 3]` (sorted)
     - `[1, 2, 3, 1]` (not sorted)
     - `[2, 3, 1, 1]` (sorted)
     - `[3, 1, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
   - Thus, exactly 2 out of the 4 cyclic shifts are sorted, which meets the requirement.

Given the above points, the program fails to find valid arrays for cases where `k >= 2` and `n != k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Counterexample:**
- Input: `4 2`
- Expected Output: `1 1 2 3` (or any other valid array that meets the criteria)
- Actual Output: `-1` (incorrect)

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
