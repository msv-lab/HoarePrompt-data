### Reasoning:

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the described problem. Let's break down the program step-by-step to understand why it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The list of integers is split into individual string elements and then converted to integers.
   - The list is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then selects every other integer starting from the first one (i.e., the smallest integers in the sorted list). This selection strategy ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible value to the score in each move, which is optimal for maximizing the final score.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the sum of the selected integers and stores this sum in the list `out`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the sums stored in `out`, which represent the maximum scores for each test case.

### Verification Against Example Input:

Let's verify the program's logic against the provided example input:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `a = [2, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[2, 3]`
  - Selected: `[2]`
  - Score: `2`
  
- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `a = [1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Selected: `[1, 1]`
  - Score: `2`
  
- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Selected: `[1, 1, 1]`
  - Score: `3`

The program's output matches the expected output for all test cases, which confirms that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:

Based on the reasoning above, the provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
