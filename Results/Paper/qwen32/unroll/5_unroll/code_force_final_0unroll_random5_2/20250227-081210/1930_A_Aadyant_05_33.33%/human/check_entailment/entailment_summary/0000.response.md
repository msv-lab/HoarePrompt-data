### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases and, for each test case, performing the following steps:

1. It reads the number of integers `n` (which means there are `2n` integers in total for each test case).
2. It reads the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It then selects every other integer starting from the first one (i.e., it selects the integers at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2).
5. It sums these selected integers and stores the sum.
6. After processing all test cases, it prints the sum for each test case.

The key insight to solving the problem optimally is to always pair the smallest available integers together. By sorting the list and selecting every other integer starting from the first one, the program effectively pairs the smallest integers together, ensuring that the sum of the minimum values of each pair is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the execution for the provided example:

### Example Execution:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 1`, List: `[2, 3]`
- Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
- Selected Integers: `[2]` (since we take every other integer starting from index 0)
- Sum: `2`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 2`, List: `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
- Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
- Selected Integers: `[1, 1]` (indices 0 and 2)
- Sum: `2`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 3`, List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Selected Integers: `[1, 1, 1]` (indices 0, 2, 4)
- Sum: `3`

These results match the expected output, confirming that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem, and its behavior aligns with the expected results based on the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
