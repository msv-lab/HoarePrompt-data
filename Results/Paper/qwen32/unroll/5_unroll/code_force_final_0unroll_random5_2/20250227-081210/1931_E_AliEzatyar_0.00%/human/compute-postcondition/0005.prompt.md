You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Here, 1 <= t <= 10^4 is the number of test cases, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element in the list. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `num` remains unchanged, `counter` is the number of consecutive '0's found at the end of `num` before encountering a non-'0' value.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of consecutive '0's found at the end of `num` before encountering a non-'0' value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns the number of consecutive '0's found at the end of the list of integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) before encountering a non-'0' value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of consecutive '0's found at the end of `num` before encountering a non-'0' value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
