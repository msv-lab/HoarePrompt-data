The input to the function `count_zero(num)` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the problem description, we can infer the preconditions for the main function that would solve this problem. The main function would take two types of inputs: the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it would take integers `n` and `m`, and a list of integers `a`. Therefore, the precondition for the main function would be: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a. The sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
