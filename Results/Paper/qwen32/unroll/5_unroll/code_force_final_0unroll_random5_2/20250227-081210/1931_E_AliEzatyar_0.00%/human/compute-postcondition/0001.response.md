The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `len(num) - 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the length of `num` is at least 1, because the loop will iterate from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `len(num) - 1 >= 0`, which simplifies to `len(num) >= 1`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is `len(num) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` should be set to a value that satisfies the loop condition, which means `len(num)` should be at least 1.

Since the problem specifies that `num` is a list of test cases and each test case is represented as a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers, we need to ensure that `num` has at least one such test case.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num` has at least one test case.

State: **`num` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `counter` is 0**
