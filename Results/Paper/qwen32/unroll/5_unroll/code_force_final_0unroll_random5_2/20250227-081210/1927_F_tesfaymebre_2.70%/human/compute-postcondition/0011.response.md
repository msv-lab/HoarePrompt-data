To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.

The loop iterates over each edge in the `edges` list, which is sorted in descending order by weight `w`, then by vertex `u`, and finally by vertex `v`. For each edge `(w, u, v)`, the following operations are performed:

1. **Find the parent of `u` and `v`**: The `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` methods are used to find the root (or parent) of the sets containing `u` and `v`, respectively.

2. **Check if `u` and `v` are in the same set**:
   - If `parent_u == parent_v`, it means `u` and `v` are already connected. In this case, the `dsu.union(u, v, w)` method is called to update the union-find structure, but this doesn't change the fact that `u` and `v` are already in the same set. The code then checks if the minimum edge in the set of `u` (or `v`, since they are the same set) is smaller than the current `_min_edge`. If it is, `_min_edge` is updated to this new minimum edge weight, and `node_u` and `node_v` are updated to `u` and `v`, respectively.
   - If `parent_u != parent_v`, it means `u` and `v` are not connected. The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` method is called to connect the two sets, merging them into a single set.

After the loop finishes, the `dsu` structure will have processed all the edges and will reflect the connected components of the graph. The variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` will reflect the minimum weight edge found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set during the loop execution.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the output state will be:

- `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as they are returned by `func_3()`.
- `graph` will remain unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `edges` will remain unchanged as it is only read in the loop.
- `dsu` will be modified to reflect the connected components after processing all edges.
- `_min_edge` will hold the minimum weight of an edge found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set.
- `node_u` and `node_v` will hold the vertices of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set.

Output State: **`n` and `m` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing `m` edges represented as adjacency lists, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing a weight `w` and the vertices `u` and `v` of an edge, sorted in descending order by weight `w`, then by vertex `u`, and finally by vertex `v`, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements reflecting the connected components after processing all edges, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `node_u` is the first vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `node_v` is the second vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set.**
