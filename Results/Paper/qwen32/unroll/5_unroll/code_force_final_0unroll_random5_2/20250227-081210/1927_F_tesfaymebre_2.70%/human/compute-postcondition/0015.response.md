To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, we need to analyze the context and the variables involved based on the initial state provided.

1. **`n` and `m`**: These are the values returned by `func_3()`. The exact values are not provided, but they represent the number of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively.

2. **`graph`**: This is a `defaultdict` with list as the default factory, containing `m` edges represented as adjacency lists. This means that for each node, there is a list of nodes it is connected to.

3. **`edges`**: This is a list of `m` tuples, each containing a weight `w` and the vertices `u` and `v` of an edge. The list is sorted in descending order by weight `w`, then by vertex `u`, and finally by vertex `v`.

4. **`dsu`**: This is an instance of the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class with `n + 1` elements. This data structure keeps track of connected components in the graph.

5. **`_min_edge`**: This is the minimum weight of an edge found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set according to the DSU structure.

6. **`node_u` and `node_v`**: These are the vertices of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set.

7. **`colors`**: This is a list of `n + 1` zeros. It is likely used for marking or coloring nodes during a depth-first search (DFS).

8. **`res`**: This variable holds the result of the `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` function call. The `dfs` function likely performs a depth-first search starting from `node_u`, not considering the edge coming from `-1` (which could be a placeholder for no parent), and returns some result stored in `res`.

Given that `res` is the result of the `dfs` function, the exact contents of `res` depend on the implementation of the `dfs` function, the structure of the graph, and the starting node `node_u`. Since the exact implementation of `dfs` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the context.

**Output Description**:
The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the list `res`, which is the result of the depth-first search starting from `node_u`. The exact elements depend on the graph's structure and the `dfs` implementation but are likely to be related to the path or properties of the graph starting from `node_u`.

Output: **res (where res is the result of the dfs function starting from node_u)**
