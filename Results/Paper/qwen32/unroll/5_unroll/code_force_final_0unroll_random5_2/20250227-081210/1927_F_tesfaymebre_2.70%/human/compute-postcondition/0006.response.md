Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the depth-first search, with `curr` appended to it. The color of the vertex `curr` is 1. If a path containing `node_v` is found during the DFS, it is returned and the loop terminates early. Otherwise, the loop completes without returning a path.**
