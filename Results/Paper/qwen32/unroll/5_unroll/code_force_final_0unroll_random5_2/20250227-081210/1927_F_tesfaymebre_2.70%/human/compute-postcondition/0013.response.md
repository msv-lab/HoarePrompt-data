The provided code snippet executes a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `node_u` with an initial parent node of `-1` and an empty list as an argument. The result of this DFS is stored in the variable `res`. 

Since the `dfs` function is not defined in the provided snippet, we can only infer that `res` will hold the result of this DFS operation. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `colors`) remain unchanged unless they are directly modified within the `dfs` function, which is not the case here.

Given the information, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing `m` edges represented as adjacency lists, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing a weight `w` and the vertices `u` and `v` of an edge, sorted in descending order by weight `w`, then by vertex `u`, and finally by vertex `v`, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements reflecting the connected components after processing all edges, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `node_u` is the first vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `node_v` is the second vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `colors` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `res` holds the result of `dfs(node_u, -1, [])`.**
