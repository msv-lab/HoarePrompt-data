### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided code consists solely of input reading functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) and does not include any logic to solve the problem as described. The program does not perform any operations to rearrange the permutation or execute the binary search algorithm. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

The function summaries provided do not indicate that any of the functions contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. Specifically, `func_5` is described as splitting the input string by whitespace and returning a list of substrings, which is a common input parsing function but does not address the core logic needed for the problem.

To solve the problem, the program needs to:
1. Read the input for each test case.
2. Determine the necessary swaps to make the binary search algorithm return the correct result.
3. Output the number of swaps and the indices involved in the swaps.

Since none of the provided functions perform these tasks, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incomplete and does not solve the given problem.

### Final: **False**
