### Reasoning:

The program is structured to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a permutation and a target value `x`. The goal is to rearrange the permutation using at most two swaps so that after performing a binary search, the element at the final `l` index of the search is `x`.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_2()` reads the integers `n` (size of the permutation) and `x` (target value).
   - `func_3()` reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

2. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The binary search is simulated using `left` and `right` pointers. The initial values are `left = 0` and `right = n`.
   - The loop continues until `right - left = 1`.
   - The middle index `mid` is calculated as `left + (right - left) // 2`.
   - The element at `p[mid]` is checked against `x`. If `p[mid] <= x`, `left` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `right` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Determining Swaps:**
   - If `p[left] == x`, no swaps are needed (`print(0)`).
   - If `x` is not seen during the binary search (`not seen[x - 1]`), one swap is needed to bring `x` to the `left` index (`print(1)` followed by the indices to swap).
   - If `x` is seen but `p[left] != x`, two swaps are needed. The first swap moves an unseen element to the `left` index, and the second swap brings `x` to the `left` index (`print(2)` followed by the indices to swap).

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Functionality:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and performs the binary search simulation.
  - It correctly identifies the need for swaps and outputs the appropriate indices.
  - The logic for determining the swaps ensures that the final `l` index of the binary search points to `x`.

- **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the constraints given in the problem statement (e.g., `1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`).
  - It correctly manages multiple test cases.
  - The logic ensures that at most two swaps are used, as required.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem description and correctly handles the given constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
