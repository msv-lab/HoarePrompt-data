To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `y`, `x`, and the range parameters.

The given for loop is:
```python
for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, `y` is the loop variable, `x - 1` is the starting point, `1` is the stopping point (exclusive), and `-1` is the step (decrement by 1 each time).

For the loop to execute at least once:
1. The starting point (`x - 1`) must be greater than the stopping point (`1`), because the range is exclusive of the stop value and the step is negative (decrementing).

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000
- `max_val` is 1

Let's analyze the conditions:
- Since `x` is at least 2, `x - 1` will be at least 1.
- For the loop to execute, `x - 1` must be greater than 1, meaning `x` must be greater than 2.

So, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `x` must be at least 3. The value of `y` is determined by the range and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1**
