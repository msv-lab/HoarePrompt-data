Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs; `input` is assigned the raw input data; `data` is a list of strings representing the split input data; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `input`, `data`, `index`, and `T` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
