### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed explanation of the program's behavior and logic, which aligns with the problem description. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness using the annotated version:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly identifies the number of test cases and processes each one sequentially.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year (`next_year`) using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula is designed to find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
     - Specifically, `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` simplifies to `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`, which indeed finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is at least `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and calculates the year for each sign based on the provided periodicities. The logic ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, aligning with the problem description.

The example provided in the problem description is correctly handled by the program, as demonstrated by the annotations. The program adheres to the problem statement and handles the edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
