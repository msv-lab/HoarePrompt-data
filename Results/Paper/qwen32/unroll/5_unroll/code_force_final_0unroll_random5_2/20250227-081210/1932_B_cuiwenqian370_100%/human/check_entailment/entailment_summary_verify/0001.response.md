### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly analyzes the logic of the program and verifies its correctness using the provided example. Let's break down the key points and ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings, which is a typical approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to `a[0]`, which is correct since the first sign occurs in the first multiple of its periodicity.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is `>= (last_year + 1)`. This is achieved by first adding `a[i] - 1` to `last_year + 1` and then performing integer division by `a[i]` followed by multiplication by `a[i]` to get the next multiple.

3. **Verification with Example:**
   - The original assessment correctly verifies the logic with the first test case from the example, showing step-by-step calculations that match the expected output.
   - The detailed breakdown confirms that the program's logic aligns with the problem description.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the program's behavior, stating that it processes multiple test cases and calculates the final synchronized year when all signs will next show the same value based on their periodicities.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs for each test case, and the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
