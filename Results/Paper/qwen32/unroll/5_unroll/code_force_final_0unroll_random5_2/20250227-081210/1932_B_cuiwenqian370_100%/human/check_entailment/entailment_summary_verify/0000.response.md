Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following a sequence where each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. Each sign occurs periodically every `a_i` years.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the input and processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur using the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: The first sign's occurrence year is set as `last_year`.
2. **Iteration**: For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
   \[
   \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
   \]
   This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
3. **Update**: `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
4. **Output**: The final `last_year` for each test case is collected and printed.

### Function Summary
The function summary describes the process correctly. It states that the function calculates the final year when all signs will occur based on their periodicities.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is correct and provides a detailed explanation of how the program works and why it should be considered correct. It highlights the use of the formula to ensure that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Verification
Let's verify the correctness of the formula and the logic:
- The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` can be simplified to `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. This computes the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
- The logic ensures that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one, which aligns with the problem description.

### Testing with Example Input
Let's test the program with the provided example input to ensure it produces the correct output:

**Input:**
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

**Expected Output:**
```
36
5
5
2012
```

The program should produce the expected output, confirming its correctness.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the given periodicities. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
