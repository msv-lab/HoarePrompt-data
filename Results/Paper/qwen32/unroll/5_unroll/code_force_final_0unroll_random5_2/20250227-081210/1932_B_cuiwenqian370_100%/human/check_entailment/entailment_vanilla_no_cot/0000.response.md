To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it accurately computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens according to the problem description. Let's go through the program step by step and see if it matches the logic needed to solve the problem.

### Problem Logic Recap:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and then read the periodicities `a1, a2, ..., an`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Initialize `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a1`.
   - For each subsequent sign, calculate the next year in which it will occur after `last_year`:
     - Compute `next_year` as the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
     - Update `last_year` to `next_year`.
   - After processing all signs, `last_year` will be the year the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the entire input at once and processes it in a loop for each test case.
- For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with `a[0]`.
- It then iterates over the remaining periodicities `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`, calculating `next_year` as `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula correctly computes the smallest multiple of `a[i]` greater than `last_year`.
- It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.
- After all signs are processed, it appends `last_year` to the results list.
- Finally, it prints all results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens. It correctly handles the input parsing, the calculation of the year for each sign, and the output.
