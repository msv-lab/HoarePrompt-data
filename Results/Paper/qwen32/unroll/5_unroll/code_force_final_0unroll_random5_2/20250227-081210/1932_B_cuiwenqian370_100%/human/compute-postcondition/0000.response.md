The provided code snippet only reads the input from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. This does not process or change any of the values described in the initial state. The initial state specifies the structure of the input, but the code does not parse or use this input in any way. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the `input` variable holding the raw input data.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs; `input` is assigned the raw input data.**
