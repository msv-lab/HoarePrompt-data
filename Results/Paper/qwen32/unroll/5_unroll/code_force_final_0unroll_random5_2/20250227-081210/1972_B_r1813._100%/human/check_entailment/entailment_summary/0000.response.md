### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins ('U') in a circular arrangement. The key insight is that the game can be analyzed by counting the number of 'U's. If the count of 'U's is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win.

The provided program reads multiple test cases from the input, counts the number of 'U's for each case, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if it is even. This approach is in line with the problem's requirements.

The logic behind this solution is as follows:
- When a player flips a coin, the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of 'U's changes.
- If the initial number of 'U's is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of 'U's is even when it's Bob's turn, ensuring that Alice wins.
- Conversely, if the initial number of 'U's is even, Bob can always respond in a way that leaves an odd number of 'U's for Alice, ensuring that Bob wins.

The program correctly implements this logic by simply checking the parity of the count of 'U's for each test case.
