### Reasoning:

The given program reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `s`. Based on the parity of this count, it determines the winner of the game.

The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win if both players play optimally. If it is even, Bob will win. This is because each move flips the state of two adjacent coins, and the parity of the number of facing-up coins remains the same after each move. The player who starts (Alice) can always force a win if the initial count of 'U' is odd, and the second player (Bob) can always force a win if the initial count of 'U' is even.

The program correctly implements this logic. It reads the input, counts the 'U's in each test case, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if the count is even.

### Correctness:

Given the problem description and the logic implemented in the program, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
