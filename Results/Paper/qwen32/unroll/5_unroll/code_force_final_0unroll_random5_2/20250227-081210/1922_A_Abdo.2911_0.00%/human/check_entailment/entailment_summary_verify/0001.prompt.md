You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it determines if the string `c` matches a specific pattern derived from `a` and `b`. The pattern requires that for each position, if `a` and `b` have the same character, `c` must also have the same character; if `a` and `b` differ, `c` must not have the same character as either `a` or `b` at that position. The function outputs 'YES' if `c` matches the pattern and 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template based on the characters of strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, it adds the lowercase version of that character to the template.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, it adds the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, since they're different) to the template.

2. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`:**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
   - If the character in the template is lowercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to that character.
   - If the character in the template is uppercase, it ensures that both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of that character.

3. **Matching Check for `c`:**
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the constructed template.
   - If the character in the template is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to that character.
   - If the character in the template is uppercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is different from the lowercase version of that character.

4. **Result Determination:**
   - The program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Verification with the Example:**

Let’s verify the program with the provided example:

**Test Case 1:**
- Input: `n = 1`, `a = 'a'`, `b = 'b'`, `c = 'c'`
- Template: `['C']`
- `a` and `b` match the template: `a[0] != 'c'` and `b[0] != 'c'`
- `c` does not match the template: `c[0] == 'c'`
- Output: `YES` (Correct)

**Test Case 2:**
- Input: `n = 2`, `a = 'aa'`, `b = 'bb'`, `c = 'aa'`
- Template: `['A', 'B']`
- `a` and `b` match the template: `a[0] != 'a'` and `a[1] != 'b'`, `b[0] != 'a'` and `b[1] != 'b'`
- `c` does not match the template: `c[0] == 'a'` and `c[1] == 'a'`
- Output: `NO` (Correct)

**Test Case 3:**
- Input: `n = 10`, `a = 'mathforces'`, `b = 'luckforces'`, `c = 'adhoccoder'`
- Template: `['M', 'A', 'T', 'H', 'F', 'O', 'R', 'C', 'E', 'S']`
- `a` and `b` match the template: `a[i] != 'm'` and `b[i] != 'm'` for each `i`
- `c` does not match the template: `c[0] == 'a'`
- Output: `YES` (Correct)

**Test Case 4:**
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = 'acc'`, `b = 'abd'`, `c = 'abc'`
- Template: `['A', 'C', 'D']`
- `a` and `b` match the template: `a[0] != 'a'`, `a[1] == 'c'` and `b[1] == 'c'`, `a[2] != 'd'` and `b[2] != 'd'`
- `c` does not match the template: `c[0] == 'a'`
- Output: `NO` (Correct)

The program correctly handles the provided test cases and adheres to the logic described in the problem statement.
