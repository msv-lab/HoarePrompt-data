You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis:
The program is designed to determine if there exists a template that matches strings `a` and `b` while not matching string `c`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Template Creation**:
   - For each character in strings `a` and `b`, the program creates a template character.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the template character is the lowercase version of that character.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, the template character is the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, it doesn't matter which one since they are different).

2. **Matching Check**:
   - The program then checks if strings `a` and `b` match the template.
     - If the template character is lowercase, both `a` and `b` must have the same lowercase character at that position.
     - If the template character is uppercase, both `a` and `b` must have different characters from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.
   - The program also checks if string `c` does not match the template.
     - If the template character is lowercase, `c` must have the same lowercase character at that position.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c` must have a character different from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.

3. **Output**:
   - If strings `a` and `b` match the template and string `c` does not, the program outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
1. **First Example**:
   ```
   1
   1
   a
   b
   c
   ```
   - Template: "C"
   - `a` and `b` match "C" (both different from 'c').
   - `c` does not match "C" (same as 'c').
   - Expected Output: "YES"

2. **Second Example**:
   ```
   2
   aa
   bb
   aa
   ```
   - Template: "AA"
   - `a` and `b` match "AA" (both different from 'a' and 'b').
   - `c` does not match "AA" (same as 'a').
   - Expected Output: "NO"

3. **Third Example**:
   ```
   10
   mathforces
   luckforces
   adhoccoder
   ```
   - Template: "CODEFORCES"
   - `a` and `b` match "CODEFORCES" (both different from 'm', 'l', 'a', 'd', etc.).
   - `c` does not match "CODEFORCES" (same as 'a', 'd', etc.).
   - Expected Output: "YES"

4. **Fourth Example**:
   ```
   3
   acc
   abd
   abc
   ```
   - Template: "ACD"
   - `a` and `b` match "ACD" (both different from 'c' and 'd').
   - `c` does not match "ACD" (same as 'c').
   - Expected Output: "NO"

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **All Characters the Same in `a` and `b`**:
   ```
   2
   aa
   aa
   ab
   ```
   - Template: "aa"
   - `a` and `b` match "aa".
   - `c` does not match "aa".
   - Expected Output: "YES"

2. **All Characters Different in `a` and `b`**:
   ```
   2
   ab
   cd
   ef
   ```
   - Template: "ABCD"
   - `a` and `b` match "ABCD".
   - `c` does not match "ABCD".
   - Expected Output: "YES"

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program with various test cases, including the provided examples and additional edge cases, the program correctly determines if there exists a template that matches strings `a` and `b` while not matching string `c`.

**Correctness: True**

The program logic correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description for all tested cases.
