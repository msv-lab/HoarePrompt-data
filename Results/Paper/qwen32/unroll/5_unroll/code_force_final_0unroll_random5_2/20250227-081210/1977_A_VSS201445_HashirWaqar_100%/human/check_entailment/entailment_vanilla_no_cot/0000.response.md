Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible for Nikita to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic is based on the fact that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be even, and `n` must be at least as large as `m` (since Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time). If both conditions are satisfied, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This aligns with the problem description and the example cases provided.
