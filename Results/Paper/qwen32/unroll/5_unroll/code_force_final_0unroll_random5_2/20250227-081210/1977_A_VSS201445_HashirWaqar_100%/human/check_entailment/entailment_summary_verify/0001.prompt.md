You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m`. For each pair, it prints "YES" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and their difference `n - m` is even; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the nature of the operations he can perform. Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower.

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Operations**: Each move can either increase or decrease the number of cubes in the tower by 1.
3. **Final State**: We need to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given these points, let's analyze the conditions under which it is possible to end up with `m` cubes:

- **Total Change**: The total change in the number of cubes after `n` moves can be any even number between -n and n (inclusive). This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus, the net effect after an even number of moves can be zero, and after an odd number of moves, the net effect can be any odd number.
- **Specific Condition**: To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference between the number of add operations and the number of remove operations must be `m`. This difference must be achievable within `n` moves, which means `m` must be within the range of possible net changes, i.e., -n to n.
- **Parity Check**: Since each move changes the number of cubes by 1, the parity (odd or even nature) of the final number of cubes (`m`) must match the parity of the number of moves (`n`). This is because an even number of moves can only result in an even net change, and an odd number of moves can only result in an odd net change.

Given these points, the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` in the provided program is not entirely correct. The correct condition should be `n >= abs(m) and (n - abs(m)) % 2 == 0` to account for the possibility of `m` being negative (which is not the case here as per the problem statement, but we should consider the absolute value for completeness).

However, the given program works correctly for the problem as stated because `m` is always non-negative, and the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` correctly checks if the final number of cubes can be achieved with the given number of moves.

Thus, the program is correct based on the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
