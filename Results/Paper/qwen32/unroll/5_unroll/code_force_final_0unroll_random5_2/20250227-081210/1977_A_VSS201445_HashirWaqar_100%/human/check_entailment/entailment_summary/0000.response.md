Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on the fact that for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, he must be able to perform a sequence of adding and removing cubes that results in exactly `m` cubes at the end. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Total Moves (n) and Desired Cubes (m):**
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes Nikita can add is `n`. Hence, the output should be "NO" in this case.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, we need to check if it's possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes. 

2. **Parity Check:**
   - Each move either adds or removes one cube, which means the total number of moves to go from 0 to `m` cubes must be `m` additions (if starting from 0). If `n` is greater than `m`, the remaining moves `(n - m)` must be an even number of removals and additions that cancel each other out. This is because each pair of removal and addition brings the count back to the same number of cubes, thus maintaining the parity.
   - Therefore, if `(n - m)` is even, it is possible to make the necessary adjustments to end up with exactly `m` cubes. If `(n - m)` is odd, it is not possible because there will always be one unmatched addition or removal.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
