To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, we need to consider the logic inside the loop and how it processes each pair of integers (n, m) provided in the input.

The loop reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the input format and the logic of the loop, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions described above.

Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` also between 1 and 100, the output will be `t` lines of "YES" or "NO".

Output State: **t lines, each containing either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0.**
