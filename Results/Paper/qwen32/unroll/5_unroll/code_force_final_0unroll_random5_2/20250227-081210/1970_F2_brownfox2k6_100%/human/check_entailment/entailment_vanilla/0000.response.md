Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Analysis
1. **Field Representation**: The field is a grid where each cell can contain players, goals, the Quaffle, or a Bludger.
2. **Player Actions**: Players can move (U, D, L, R), catch the Quaffle (C), or throw the Quaffle (T).
3. **Bludger Actions**: The Bludger moves and can eliminate players.
4. **Scoring**: A team scores when a player throws the Quaffle into the opposing team's goal.
5. **Elimination**: Players are eliminated if they are in the same cell as the Bludger.
6. **Output**: The program should output when a goal is scored, when a player is eliminated, and the final score.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's analyze each function:

1. **Function `func_1(obj, d)`**:
   - This function moves an object (`obj`) in the direction specified by `d` (U, D, L, R).
   - It correctly updates the coordinates of `obj` based on the direction.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct for moving an object in the grid.

2. **Function `func_2(t)`**:
   - This function checks for eliminations by comparing the positions of players with the position of the Bludger.
   - It prints the elimination of players who are in the same cell as the Bludger.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly identifies and prints the elimination of players by the Bludger.

### Missing Components
- **Field Representation**: The code does not define the field or the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, or the Bludger.
- **Player Actions**: There is no code to handle player actions like moving, catching, or throwing the Quaffle.
- **Goal Scoring**: There is no code to handle the scoring mechanism.
- **Bludger Movement**: There is no code to handle the movement of the Bludger.
- **Final Score**: The code does not calculate or print the final score.

### Conclusion
The provided code only includes two functions that handle part of the problem requirements, specifically object movement and player elimination by the Bludger. The code is missing essential components to fully implement the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
