Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code snippets (`func_1` and `func_2`) are incomplete and do not fully implement the requirements described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to move an object (presumably a player or a ball) in the grid based on the direction provided (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - However, it does not check whether the move is valid (i.e., whether the new position is within the bounds of the grid). This is a critical requirement as per the problem statement.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle the case where a player catches or throws the Quaffle, which are also specified actions in the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to handle the elimination of players when they are in the same cell as the Bludger.
   - It correctly identifies players that are in the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
   - However, it does not update the grid or handle the state of the Quaffle properly when a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle.
   - Additionally, it does not handle the scoring mechanism when a player successfully puts the Quaffle in the opposing team's goal.
   - The function also does not handle the reset of the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it lacks the logic to handle moves, catching and throwing the Quaffle, scoring, and resetting the Quaffle after a goal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To make the program correct, we would need to implement the missing logic and ensure that all actions specified in the problem statement are handled properly.
