### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if they correctly implement the problem description.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The code reads the dimensions of the field (N and M).
   - It then reads the field configuration, storing the positions of the red goals (`rg`), blue goals (`bg`), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and all players (`player`).
   - It initializes `carry` to `None` (no one is carrying the Quaffle initially) and `bs` and `rs` to 0 (scores of the blue and red teams).

2. **Processing Actions:**
   - For each action, the code identifies the player or entity performing the action (`p`) and the action (`d`).
   - If the action is 'C', it sets `carry` to the player who caught the Quaffle.
   - If the action is 'T', it sets `carry` to `None` (the player throws the Quaffle) and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If it is, it updates the score and prints the appropriate goal message.
   - If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, it calls `func_1` to move the entity.
   - If the entity is a player, it calls `func_1` to move the player and `func_2` to check for eliminations. If the player is carrying the Quaffle, it updates the Quaffle's position to the player's new position.

3. **Functions:**
   - `func_1`: Moves an entity based on the direction provided. This function correctly updates the coordinates of the entity.
   - `func_2`: Checks if any player is at the same position as the Bludger and eliminates them. It prints the elimination message for each eliminated player.

4. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all actions, the code prints the final score.

### Analysis:
- The code correctly handles the movement of entities based on the actions provided.
- It correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the score accordingly.
- It correctly identifies when a player is eliminated by the Bludger and prints the elimination message.
- The final score is printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code correctly implements all the required functionalities as per the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.

**Correctness: True**
