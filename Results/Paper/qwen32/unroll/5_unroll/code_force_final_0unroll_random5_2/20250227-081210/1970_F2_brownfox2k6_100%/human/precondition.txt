N and M are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99. The field is a 2D grid of size N x M where each cell contains either ".." (empty), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). There is at least one goal for each team and at most five goals for each team. There is exactly one Quaffle and at most one Bludger. T is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. Each action in the list of T actions is a valid move or action for the respective entity, ensuring that players do not move out of bounds, catch balls not in the same cell, or throw the Quaffle if not carrying it.
