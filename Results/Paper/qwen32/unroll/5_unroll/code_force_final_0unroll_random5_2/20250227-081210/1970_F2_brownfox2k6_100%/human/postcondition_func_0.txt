The function `func_1` modifies the input list `obj`, which represents the coordinates of an entity on a field, by updating these coordinates based on the direction specified by the character `d`. The direction `d` can be 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), or 'R' (right). After the function call, `obj` contains the new coordinates of the entity after moving in the specified direction.
