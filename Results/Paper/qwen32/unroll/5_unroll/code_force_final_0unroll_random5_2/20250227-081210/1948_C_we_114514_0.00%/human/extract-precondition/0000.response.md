Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and two strings of length n. n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each string consists of characters '<' and '>' only. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
