In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. The loop will execute if and only if `test_cases` contains at least one tuple. 

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`test_cases`**: This is the only list involved in the loop head. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. Each tuple should contain an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' only.

2. **`test_case`**: This variable is used to iterate over each element in `test_cases`. Before the loop starts, `test_case` does not need to be explicitly defined, as it is assigned during each iteration of the loop.

3. **`t` and `results`**: These variables are mentioned in the state but are not part of the loop head. `t` represents the number of test cases and `results` is an empty list. Since they are not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust them for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple. Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple contains an integer n and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' only; `results` is an empty list.**

To explicitly ensure the loop will execute, we can specify that `test_cases` contains exactly `t` tuples, each meeting the specified criteria:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' only; `results` is an empty list.**
