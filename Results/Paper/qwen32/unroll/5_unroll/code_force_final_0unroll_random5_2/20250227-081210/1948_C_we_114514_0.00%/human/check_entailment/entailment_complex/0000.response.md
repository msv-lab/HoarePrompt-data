### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided function `func_1` and see if it correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from (1, 1).

The function iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by following the specified movement rules. Specifically, it maintains two boolean variables, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to keep track of whether the robot can reach the end of the first row or the second row, respectively.

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is initialized to `True` because the robot starts at (1, 1).
   - `reachable_second_row` is initialized to `False` because the robot does not start at the second row.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The function iterates over each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If `j` is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to the second row and reach the end.
       - Otherwise, it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot moves to the next column in the first row.
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot cannot move left from the first column.
       - If `j` is not the last column and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move down to the second row and then move right.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If `j` is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (though it's already `True`).
       - Otherwise, it implicitly assumes the robot can move to the next column in the second row.

3. **Result**:
   - After iterating through all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

### Issues:

The above logic has some issues:
- The function does not correctly handle the scenario where the robot can move between rows based on the current cell's arrow direction.
- The function does not account for all possible moves and transitions between rows and columns.
- The function does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and arrow following in a 2xN grid.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from (1, 1) based on the problem description and the provided examples.

**Correctness: False**
