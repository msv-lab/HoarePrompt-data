### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine if it is possible to redistribute water in containers such that each container has the same amount of water. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Calculate the Mean**: The program calculates the mean (average) amount of water each container should hold if the water is to be evenly distributed. This is done by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers `n`.

2. **Check Redistribution Feasibility**: The program then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the difference between the current amount of water and the mean. If at any point this running total becomes negative, it means there are more containers with less water than needed to reach the mean, and it's impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers equal without violating the pouring rule (i.e., pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`). If the running total never becomes negative, it means it is possible to redistribute the water.

3. **Return Result**: Based on the above check, the program returns 'YES' if redistribution is possible and 'NO' otherwise.

The execution summary provided describes a misinterpretation of the input structure. It states that `func_1` accepts a list of lists, but the actual implementation shows that `func_1` is called with a single list of integers for each test case.

Despite the misdescription in the execution summary, the logic of the program itself is correct. It accurately checks whether the water can be redistributed according to the given constraints.
