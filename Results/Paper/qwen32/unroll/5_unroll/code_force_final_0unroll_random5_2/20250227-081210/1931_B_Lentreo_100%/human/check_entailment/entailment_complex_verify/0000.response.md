### Reasoning:
The original assessment initially stated that the provided program is incorrect, citing a flawed logic in the `func_1` function. However, upon a detailed analysis of the annotated code and the logic implemented, it becomes clear that the function correctly implements the necessary checks to determine if it is possible to equalize the water levels in all containers.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that a target water level (`mean`) can be calculated for each container.

2. **Logic of the Program**:
   - The program calculates the `mean` water level as `total // n`.
   - It then iterates through the list of water levels (`nums`), maintaining a cumulative difference (`curr`) between the current water level and the `mean`.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the function returns 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to redistribute water to achieve the target level without violating the operation constraints.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the water levels can be equalized.

3. **Validation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The cumulative difference (`curr`) is correctly calculated and checked for negativity.
   - The final value of `curr` should indeed be 0 if the water levels can be equalized, as the sum of deviations from the mean should balance out.

4. **Counterexample Review**:
   - The counterexample provided in the original assessment actually supports the correctness of the logic. For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the cumulative differences are `-1`, `-1`, and `0`, and the function correctly returns 'NO' because the cumulative difference was negative at one point. However, this is not a flaw; it correctly identifies that the water cannot be equalized without violating the constraints.
   - The provided code does not need to handle the case where the cumulative difference is negative because it correctly identifies that such a scenario means redistribution is not possible under the given constraints.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct and accurately reflects the problem constraints.
   - The annotations and the behavior of the program align with the expected outcomes for the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
