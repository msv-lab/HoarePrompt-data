### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine whether it is possible to redistribute water in the containers such that each container holds the same amount of water. The program does this by checking if, as we iterate through the containers, we can always pour water from a container to a subsequent one without ever needing to "take back" water (i.e., without the cumulative deviation from the mean becoming negative).

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Total Calculation**: The sum of the water amounts in the containers is calculated.
   - **Mean Calculation**: Since the total sum is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`, the mean amount of water per container is calculated.
   - **Deviation Check**: The program iterates through the containers, maintaining a running total of the deviation from the mean. If at any point this deviation becomes negative, it means that we would need to "take back" water from a previous container, which is not allowed by the problem constraints. Hence, the function returns 'NO'.
   - **Final Check**: If the loop completes without the deviation becoming negative, the function returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the same amount.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
- **Incorrect Input Handling**: The comment states that `nums` is a list of lists, which is incorrect. `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts for a single test case, not a list of test cases.
- **Logic Error**: The logic of the function is flawed. The program should be checking the cumulative deviation from the mean as it iterates through the containers, but the comment suggests an incorrect state where `nums` is a list of lists. This confusion could lead to incorrect results.
- **Correct Logic**: The correct logic should be to iterate through the containers and check if the cumulative deviation from the mean is non-negative. If it is, then it is possible to redistribute the water; otherwise, it is not.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program as described in the comments is incorrect due to the misunderstanding of the input structure and the flawed logic. However, the actual code provided seems to implement the correct logic. Therefore, based on the code provided and not the comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
