### Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem by maximizing the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the input array. Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized when calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for `i` from 2 to `n`. This is because the difference between the smallest and the next smallest element will be added first, and so on, which maximizes the total sum of differences.

2. **Calculating Beauty**: After sorting, the program calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted in ascending order, the absolute difference is simply `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and stores the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the program using the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: Input `3 2 1 3`
   - Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`
   
2. **Test Case 2**: Input `3 69 69 69`
   - Sorted array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   
3. **Test Case 3**: Input `5 100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
   
4. **Test Case 4**: Input `4 3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   
5. **Test Case 5**: Input `2 2 1`
   - Sorted array: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

All the test cases produce the expected results, confirming that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

**Correctness:** **True**
