The provided code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This means that `input` now refers to the function that reads all input from the standard input until EOF (End of File) is reached, rather than the built-in `input()` function.

Output State: **array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is the `sys.stdin.read` function.**
