You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: freq is a dictionary with counts of each element in arr. For example, if arr = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5], freq will be {2: 2, 3: 2, 1: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick, and no stick is used in more than one polygon. 

### Key Points:
1. A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length.
2. The smallest regular polygon is a triangle, which requires 3 sticks of the same length.
3. We need to count the number of groups of sticks that can form regular polygons, starting with the smallest possible polygon (triangle).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a dictionary (`freq`) to count the frequency of each stick length. It then calculates the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3 (the minimum number of sticks required for a polygon) and summing these values.

### Issues in the Provided Solution:
1. The solution assumes that the smallest polygon is always a triangle (3 sides). However, this is not necessarily true for all test cases. For example, a square (4 sides) can be formed with fewer types of polygons than a triangle if there are enough sticks of the same length.
2. The solution does not consider polygons with more than 3 sides. It only considers the case where each group of sticks can form a triangle.

### Correct Approach:
We need to check for the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each possible number of sides (from 3 upwards) and choose the maximum among them.

### Correctness:
Given the provided solution only considers the formation of triangles, it is not correct for all cases. Therefore, the solution provided is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
