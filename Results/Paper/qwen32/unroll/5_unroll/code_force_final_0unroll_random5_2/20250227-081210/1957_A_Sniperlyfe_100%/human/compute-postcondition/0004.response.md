Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second part is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The function returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3 across all test cases.**
