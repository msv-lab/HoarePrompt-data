Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the given function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \(k\) pairs chosen for excursions, where the friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 each time they are chosen. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Total number of possible pairs**: For \(n\) children, the total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship value increase**: For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
3. **Expected value calculation**: The expected sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions needs to be calculated.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains logical errors. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It reads \(m\) lines of input specifying the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculations**:
   - \(M\) is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - \(c\) is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
   - \(a\) accumulates the sum of initial friendship values.
   - The nested loop for \(k\) iterations is intended to calculate the expected sum, but the logic is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The inner loop incorrectly adds the product of \(c\), \(i\), \(c\), and \(m\) to \(s\) in each iteration. This does not correctly represent the expected value calculation.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship values over \(k\) excursions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing a friend pair in each excursion, which is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
2. Calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each friend pair over \(k\) excursions.
3. Sum up the expected values for all friend pairs and non-friend pairs.

### Correct Formula:
The expected sum of friendship values can be derived as follows:
- The expected number of times a specific friend pair is chosen is \(\frac{km}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The expected friendship value for a specific friend pair after \(k\) excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\sum_{j=1}^{x} j = \frac{x(x+1)}{2}\), where \(x = \frac{km}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The total expected sum is the sum of the expected values for all friend pairs plus the contributions from non-friend pairs.

### Correct Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        inv_total_pairs = pow(total_pairs, -1, MOD)
        expected_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected number of times this pair is chosen
            expected_chosen = (k * m * inv_total_pairs) % MOD
            # Expected sum of friendship values for this pair
            expected_value = (expected_chosen * (expected_chosen + 1) // 2) % MOD
            expected_sum = (expected_sum + f * expected_value) % MOD
        # Add the expected sum of non-friend pairs
        expected_sum = (expected_sum + (k * (total_pairs - m) * inv_total_pairs) % MOD) % MOD
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value as described in the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
