### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the described problem.

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\dfrac{p}{q}\), and then computing \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), and `k` (number of excursions).
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing two children indices and their friendship value.

2. **Modular Arithmetic Setup:**
   - The modulus \(M = 10^9 + 7\) is defined.
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i` for the `m` pairs of friends.

4. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` calculates the expected sum for each excursion. The formula used inside the loop is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the result `s` is printed modulo \(M\).

### Issues in the Program:

The formula used in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` seems incorrect based on the problem statement. The correct approach involves understanding that the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be derived from the probability of selecting each pair and the incremental increase in their friendship values.

The correct expected value calculation should account for the probability of selecting each pair of friends and the incremental increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions. The provided program does not correctly implement this logic.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
