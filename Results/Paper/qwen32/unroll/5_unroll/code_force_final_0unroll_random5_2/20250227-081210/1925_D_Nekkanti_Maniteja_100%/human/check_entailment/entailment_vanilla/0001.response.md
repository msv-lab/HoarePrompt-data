Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Total number of possible pairs**: For \(n\) children, the total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship value increase**: For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
3. **Expected value calculation**: The expected sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions needs to be calculated.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value as described. Let's break down its logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It reads \(m\) lines of input specifying the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculations**:
   - \(M\) is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - \(c\) is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
   - \(a\) accumulates the sum of initial friendship values.
   - The nested loop for \(k\) iterations is intended to calculate the expected sum, but the logic is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The inner loop is intended to calculate the expected sum, but the formula used is incorrect. The program incorrectly adds the product of \(c\), \(i\), \(c\), and \(m\) to \(s\) in each iteration, which does not correctly represent the expected value calculation.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship values over \(k\) excursions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing a friend pair in each excursion.
2. Calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each friend pair over \(k\) excursions.
3. Sum up the expected values for all friend pairs and non-friend pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
