### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for excursions. The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It reads \( m \) lines of input specifying the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculations**:
   - \( M \) is set to \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - \( c \) is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \( M \).
   - \( a \) accumulates the sum of initial friendship values.
   - The nested loop for \( k \) iterations is intended to calculate the expected sum.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates \( c \) as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs:
     \[
     c = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)^{-1} \bmod M
     \]
   - The program then accumulates the initial friendship values in \( a \):
     \[
     a = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i
     \]
   - The program then calculates the sum \( s \) using the formula:
     \[
     s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \right)
     \]
     Simplifying the inner loop:
     \[
     s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( c^2 \cdot m \cdot i + c \cdot a \right)
     \]
     This can be further simplified as:
     \[
     s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i + c \cdot a \cdot k
     \]
     Using the formula for the sum of the first \( k-1 \) integers:
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = \frac{(k-1)k}{2}
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k
     \]
     Finally, the program prints \( s \mod M \).

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations state that the final output for each test case is determined by the formula:
     \[
     (c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k) \% M
     \]
   - This matches the derived formula from the program.

#### Correctness:
The program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for excursions using the derived formula. The annotations confirm that the program logic aligns with the expected calculations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
