Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`:**
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates over the array from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, the while condition checks if `list[i] > 1` and `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0`. This condition is too restrictive. The operation can be performed as long as `list[i] >= 2` and `list[i - 1] >= 1` and `list[i + 1] >= 1`.
   - The operation inside the while loop is incorrect. It should decrement `list[i + 1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i - 1]` by 1, not by `list[i - 1]`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array cannot be made zero using the described operations. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 7, 2]`, the program will incorrectly return "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the operations.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints "NO" as soon as it finds a non-zero element in the array after the loop, which is incorrect. It should only print "NO" after checking the entire array.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the test case:
```
4
1 2 7 2
```

The correct output should be "NO" because it is impossible to make all elements zero using the described operations. However, the provided program will incorrectly return "YES" or "NO" based on its flawed logic.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    if n < 3:
        return False
    
    # Normalize the array by performing the operation as much as possible
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] >= 2 and arr[i - 1] >= 1 and arr[i + 1] >= 1:
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if all elements are zero
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# main()
```

This corrected implementation correctly simulates the operations and checks if all elements can be made zero.
