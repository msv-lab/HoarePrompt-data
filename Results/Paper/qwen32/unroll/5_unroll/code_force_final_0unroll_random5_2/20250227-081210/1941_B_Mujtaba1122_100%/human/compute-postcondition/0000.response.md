To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters.

Here's the provided loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1.
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
- The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
1. **Range Validity**: The range `range(1, n - 1)` must be valid. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 2.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is 1, which is within the range if `n > 2`.

### Given State:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is equal to the length of `list`.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- The given state already ensures that `n` is within the range [3, 2 * 10^5], which means `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, the range `range(1, n - 1)` is valid.
- The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because the loop head initializes `i` to 1, which is appropriate for the range.

### Conclusion:
Since the given state already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute, no further adjustments are necessary for the loop to start.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is equal to the length of `list`**
