### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine `k`**: The variable `k` is set to `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and does not exceed the difference between the promotional price of the first bun and the usual price `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, Bob should not apply the promotion since selling buns at the promotional price would not yield higher profit than selling them at the usual price. Therefore, the profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated in two parts:
     - The sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the promotional price. This is computed as the sum of an arithmetic series `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`.
     - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`, which is `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the calculated profit.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:
- **First Test Case (n=4, a=4, b=5)**:
  - `k = min(4, 5-4) = 1`
  - Profit = `5 + 4*3 = 17`
- **Second Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=9)**:
  - `k = min(5, 9-5) = 4`
  - Profit = `(9 + 6) // 2 * 4 + 5*1 = 35`
- **Third Test Case (n=10, a=10, b=5)**:
  - `k = min(10, 5-10) = 0`
  - Profit = `10*10 = 100`
- **Fourth Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=11)**:
  - `k = min(5, 11-5) = 5`
  - Profit = `(11 + 7) // 2 * 5 = 45`
- **Fifth Test Case (n=10^9, a=10^9, b=10^9)**:
  - `k = min(10^9, 10^9-10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9`
- **Sixth Test Case (n=10^9, a=10^9, b=1)**:
  - `k = min(10^9, 1-10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9`
- **Seventh Test Case (n=1000, a=1, b=1000)**:
  - `k = min(1000, 1000-1) = 999`
  - Profit = `(1000 + 2) // 2 * 999 + 1*1 = 500500`

All these test cases match the expected output, confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
