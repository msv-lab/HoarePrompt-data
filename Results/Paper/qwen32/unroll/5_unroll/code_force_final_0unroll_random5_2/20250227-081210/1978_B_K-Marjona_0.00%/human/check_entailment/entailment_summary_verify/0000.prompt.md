You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a` multiplied by `n`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and `n`, and prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob sells buns at a usual price of `a` coins each. He can also sell the first `k` buns at a modified price where the `i`-th bun is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins. The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

### Analysis
1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`**:
   - The program calculates `k = min(n, b - a)`. This is intended to determine the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without the price becoming non-positive.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit from selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

4. **Summation of Modified Prices**:
   - The summation of the prices for the first `k` buns is done using the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`. This is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and ending at `b - k + 1`.

### Potential Issues
- **Correctness of `k` Calculation**:
  - The calculation `k = min(n, b - a)` seems correct. It ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the price does not become non-positive.
  
- **Summation Formula**:
  - The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is correct for summing the arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `b <= a`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
  - When `b > a`, the program correctly calculates the profit from selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Testing Potential Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program works correctly:

1. **Case 1**: `n = 1, a = 1, b = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1` (since `b <= a`, all buns are sold at `a`).
   - Program Output: `1`.

2. **Case 2**: `n = 10, a = 1, b = 10`
   - Expected Output: `55` (since `k = 10`, the sum of prices from 10 to 1 is 55).
   - Program Output: `55`.

3. **Case 3**: `n = 5, a = 10, b = 5`
   - Expected Output: `50` (since `b <= a`, all buns are sold at `a`).
   - Program Output: `50`.

4. **Case 4**: `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000` (since `b <= a`, all buns are sold at `a`).
   - Program Output: `1000000000000000000`.

5. **Case 5**: `n = 1000000000, a = 1, b = 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `500000000500000000` (since `k = 1000000000`, the sum of prices from 1000000000 to 1 is 500000000500000000).
   - Program Output: `500000000500000000`.

### Conclusion
