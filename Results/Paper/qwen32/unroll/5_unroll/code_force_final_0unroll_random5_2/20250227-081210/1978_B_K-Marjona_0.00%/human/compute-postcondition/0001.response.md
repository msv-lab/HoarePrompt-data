To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given loop and how it modifies the outputs based on the inputs provided for each test case.

The loop processes `t` test cases, each defined by the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b` and prints the result.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's logic:
1. **Input Reading**: For each iteration, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Condition Check**:
   - If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 until `b - k + 1`, where `k = min(n, b - a)`. It then adds the remaining `n - k` terms, each equal to `a`.

The loop does not modify the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` outside of its local scope for each iteration. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state remain unchanged, as the loop only uses these variables to compute and print results for each test case.

Thus, the output state will reflect that the loop has processed all test cases and printed the respective results without altering the initial values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` in the broader context.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, and the results for each test case have been printed.**
