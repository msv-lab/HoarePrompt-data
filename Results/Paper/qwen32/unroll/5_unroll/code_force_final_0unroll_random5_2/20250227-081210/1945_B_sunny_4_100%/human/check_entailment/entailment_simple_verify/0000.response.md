Let's analyze the problem and the provided program code in detail, considering the annotations and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time. Given two installations launching fireworks at regular intervals `a` and `b` minutes, and each firework being visible for `m + 1` minutes, we need to account for overlaps in visibility periods.

### Program Code Analysis

The provided program code is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        a, b, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = m // a + m // b + 2
        print(ans)
```

### Annotations

The annotations state that for each test case, the program calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints the result. This suggests that the program is incorrectly adding 2 to the sum of fireworks from both installations, which is not always valid.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not handle overlaps correctly and adds 2 to the sum of fireworks from both installations, which is not always valid. The provided counterexample supports this claim.

### Detailed Reasoning

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Fireworks from Installation 1:**
   - Launches fireworks at times `0, a, 2a, 3a, ...`.
   - Each firework is visible from `x` to `x + m` minutes.
   - Number of fireworks visible within the first `m` minutes: `m // a + 1`.

2. **Fireworks from Installation 2:**
   - Launches fireworks at times `0, b, 2b, 3b, ...`.
   - Each firework is visible from `x` to `x + m` minutes.
   - Number of fireworks visible within the first `m` minutes: `m // b + 1`.

3. **Overlap Consideration:**
   - The program does not account for fireworks from both installations being visible at the same time.
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly handle overlaps and adds an incorrect constant.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of visibility periods. This involves more complex calculations, such as using the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. It incorrectly adds 2 to the sum of fireworks from both installations and does not handle overlaps properly. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
