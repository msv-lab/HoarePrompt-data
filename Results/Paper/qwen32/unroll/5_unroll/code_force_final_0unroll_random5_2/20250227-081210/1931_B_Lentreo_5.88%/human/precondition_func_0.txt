The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the number of containers, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed that the sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n and does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
