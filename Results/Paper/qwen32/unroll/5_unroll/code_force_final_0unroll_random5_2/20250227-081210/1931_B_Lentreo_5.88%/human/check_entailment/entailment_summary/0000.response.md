Reasoning: 
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program incorrectly assumes that the redistribution can be achieved by only moving water from non-zero containers to the last container. This is not sufficient to solve the problem, as water can be moved between any two containers i and j where i < j.

The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sums of the containers can be balanced to the average amount of water per container. Specifically, for each container, the cumulative water up to that point should be divisible by the number of containers considered so far. If this condition holds for all containers, then it is possible to redistribute the water evenly.

Given the current implementation, it does not account for the requirement that water can be moved between any two containers i and j where i < j, and it incorrectly focuses only on the last container.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
