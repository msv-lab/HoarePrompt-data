Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that we need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any container i to any container j where i < j. Given that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the target amount of water in each container is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers.

### Key Insight:
To solve this problem, we need to check if we can distribute the water such that each container has the same amount. This can be done by ensuring that we can "balance" the water from left to right. Specifically, at any point in the process of moving from the first container to the last, the cumulative amount of water moved should not exceed the amount of water that would be needed to balance the containers up to that point.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Here's why:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `last` is set to the last element of the list `nums`. This is not useful for the problem at hand.
2. **Cumulative Difference Calculation**: The program calculates the cumulative difference `curr` by adding the difference between each element and `last` if the element is not zero. This does not correctly simulate the process of balancing water from left to right.
3. **Final Check**: The program checks if `curr` is zero and prints "YES" if it is, otherwise "NO". This check does not ensure that the containers can be balanced as required.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the containers can be balanced, we should:
1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers.
2. Traverse the list of containers and keep a running total of the water. At each step, check if the running total is equal to the expected total for the number of containers processed so far. If at any point it is not possible to balance, return "NO". If we can balance up to the last container, return "YES".

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the containers can be balanced. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
