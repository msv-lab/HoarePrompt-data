Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the correct conditions to redistribute the water as described.

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

The program calculates a `curr` value by iterating through the list `nums` and adding the difference between each element and the last element (`last`) to `curr`, but only if the element is not zero. It then checks if `curr` is zero to determine if the redistribution is possible.

This logic is incorrect because it does not properly check the conditions for redistributing water. The correct approach would involve checking if the cumulative sum of water up to each point can be balanced with the average amount of water each container should have.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

Explanation of the example:
- The sum of water is 6, and there are 3 containers, so each container should have 2 units of water.
- The program calculates `curr` as follows:
  - `last = 3`
  - `curr = (1 - 3) + (2 - 3) + (3 - 3) = -2 - 1 + 0 = -3`
  - Since `curr` is not zero, the program incorrectly outputs "NO", but the correct answer should be "NO" because it is not possible to redistribute the water to make each container have exactly 2 units of water.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case and potentially others, leading to the conclusion that `Correctness: False`.
