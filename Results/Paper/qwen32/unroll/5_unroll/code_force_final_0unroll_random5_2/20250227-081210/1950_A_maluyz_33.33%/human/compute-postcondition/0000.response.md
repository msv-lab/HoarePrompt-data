The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. However, after executing this line, `t` will be reassigned to the new integer value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**
