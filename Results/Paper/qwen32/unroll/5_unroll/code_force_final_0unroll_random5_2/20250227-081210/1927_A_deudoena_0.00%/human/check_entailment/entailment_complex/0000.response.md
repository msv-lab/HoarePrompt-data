### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white to turn all cells in a strip white. However, the current implementation of the function is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the entire input as a single string (`inpstr = input()`). This will not work as expected because the input format includes multiple test cases, each with its own `n` and `s`. The function needs to read the number of test cases (`t`) first and then process each test case individually.

2. **Finding Indices**: The function correctly identifies the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string. However, these indices are used incorrectly. The goal is to find the minimum segment that needs to be painted to cover all 'B's, not just the segment between the first and last 'B'.

3. **Calculating Output**: The function calculates the output as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements. This calculation does not necessarily give the minimum segment length that covers all 'B's.

### Correct Implementation:
To solve the problem correctly, the function should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read `n` and the string `s`.
- Determine the minimum segment length that covers all 'B's. This can be done by finding the longest continuous sequence of 'W's and subtracting that length from the total length `n`. The result is the minimum segment that needs to be painted white to cover all 'B's.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
