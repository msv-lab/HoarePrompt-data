The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `ind1` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `inpstr`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`; `inpstr` is assigned the value of `input()`; `ind1` is 0.**
