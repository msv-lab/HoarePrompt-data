The code snippet `s = ''` initializes the variable `s` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a`, with `s` now being an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n; `s` is an empty string.**
