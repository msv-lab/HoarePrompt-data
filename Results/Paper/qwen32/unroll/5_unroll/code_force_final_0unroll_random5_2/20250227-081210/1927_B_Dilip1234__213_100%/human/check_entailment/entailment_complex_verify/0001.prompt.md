You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. It is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: `s` is a string of length `n` constructed based on the values in `a` and `char_count` reflects the frequency of each character in `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` of length `n` constructed based on the values in `a` and `char_count` reflects the frequency of each character in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a string `s` of length `n` composed of lowercase Latin letters. The string `s` is constructed such that the frequency of each character in `s` corresponds to the values specified in the list `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to reconstruct a string `s` from its trace `a`. The trace `a` is an array where each element `a_i` indicates how many times the character at position `i` of the string `s` has appeared before it.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program takes the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the string `n`.
   - It reads the trace array `a`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with `n` and `a` as arguments.
3. In the function `func_1`:
   - It initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It initializes a list `char_count` of size 26 (for each letter of the alphabet) with all elements set to 0.
   - It iterates over the trace array `a`:
     - For each element `a_i` in `a`, it searches for the first character `j` (from 'a' to 'z') whose count `char_count[j]` matches `a_i`.
     - It appends this character to the string `s`.
     - It increments the count of this character in `char_count`.
4. It returns the constructed string `s`.

### Correctness Check:
The logic of the program is sound. Here's why:
- The program ensures that each character in the constructed string `s` has the correct number of occurrences before it, as dictated by the trace `a`.
- The program iterates over all possible characters ('a' to 'z') to find the next character to append to `s` based on the current count requirements.
- The problem guarantees that a valid string `s` exists for each trace `a`, so the program will always find a valid character to append.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- For the trace `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`, the program will construct a string where each character appears the correct number of times before its position, resulting in a valid string like "abracadabra".
- Similarly, for the other test cases, the program will construct valid strings.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the string `s` from its trace `a` as per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
