### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that if any outcome `i` wins, the coins received (multiplied by `k_i`) are strictly greater than the total coins bet.
- Formally, we need to find `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \; i
  \]

#### Provided Program Analysis:
- The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` using the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
- It then computes the bets `x_i` as `m // k_i`, where `m` is the LCM.
- It checks if the total sum of these bets is less than `m`. If not, it outputs `-1`; otherwise, it prints the bets.

#### Annotations Validation:
- **Function `func_1`**: Computes the LCM of two numbers by calculating the absolute product divided by their GCD.
- **Function `func_2`**: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The key idea in the provided program is to use the LCM to ensure that the bets satisfy the condition for all outcomes.
- Let's verify this approach:
  - If `m` is the LCM of `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`, then for each `i`, `m // k_i` is an integer.
  - The sum of the bets is:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i}
    \]
  - For each `i`, the coins received if outcome `i` wins are:
    \[
    k_i \cdot \frac{m}{k_i} = m
    \]
  - Since `m` is the LCM, it is the smallest number that is divisible by all `k_i`. Therefore, the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m`:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i} < m
    \]
  - This ensures that for any winning outcome `i`, the coins received (`m`) are strictly greater than the total coins bet.

#### Comparison with Original Assessment:
- The original assessment incorrectly states that the provided program does not implement the required logic and suggests a simpler solution of betting `1` on each outcome.
- However, the provided program correctly uses the LCM to ensure the condition is met for all outcomes, which is a valid and mathematically sound approach.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
