Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers. However, the problem requires a strategy to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

To solve the problem, a suitable strategy could involve setting the bets in such a way that the total bet is minimized while ensuring that the return for each winning outcome is strictly greater than the total bet. One possible approach is to set the bets to be the LCM of all multipliers divided by each multiplier, minus a small constant to ensure the condition is met strictly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function to calculate LCM of two numbers
def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Function to calculate LCM of a list of numbers
def lcm_list(numbers):
    return reduce(lcm, numbers)

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n = case[0]
        k = case[1]
        total_lcm = lcm_list(k)
        bets = []
        total_bet = 0
        for ki in k:
            bet = (total_lcm // ki) - 1
            bets.append(bet)
            total_bet += bet
        # Check if the condition is met
        valid = all(ki * bet > total_bet for ki, bet in zip(k, bets))
        if valid:
            results.append(bets)
        else:
            results.append([-1])
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = list(map(int, data[index + 1: index + 1 + n]))
    test_cases.append((n, k))
    index += 1 + n

# Solve and print results
results = solve(test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

This program calculates the LCM of the multipliers and sets each bet to be `(LCM / ki) - 1` to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If the condition is not met, it outputs `-1`.
