You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute bets in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for any winning outcome. Given `n` outcomes with multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`, we need to find bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \forall i \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]

This implies that for each outcome `i`, the sum of bets on other outcomes should be less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.

### Approach

The provided code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for each test case. The LCM can be used to determine a common base for the bets such that the conditions are satisfied. Here's how:

1. **Calculate the LCM of the multipliers**: The LCM ensures that the bets can be scaled to meet the conditions for all outcomes.
2. **Determine the bets**: For each outcome `i`, the bet `x_i` can be set as `LCM / k_i`. This ensures that the sum of bets on other outcomes will be less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.

### Code Explanation

- **Function 1 (func_1)**: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
- **Function 2 (func_2)**: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

### Implementation

The code does not explicitly implement the betting strategy but calculates the LCM, which can be used to derive the bets. However, the code does not provide the bets directly. To make the code correct, we need to derive the bets from the LCM.

### Correctness

The provided code calculates the LCM, which is a crucial step in determining the bets, but it does not provide the bets themselves. To make the code correct, we need to add the step to derive the bets from the LCM.

### Revised Code

Here is the revised code that calculates the bets:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function 1: Calculate LCM of two numbers
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Function 2: Calculate LCM of a list of numbers
def func_2(numbers):
    return reduce(func_1, numbers)

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        k = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        lcm = func_2(k)
        bets = [lcm // ki for ki in k]
        total_bets = sum(bets)
        valid = True
        for ki, bet in zip(k, bets):
            if total_bets - bet >= ki * bet:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, bets)))
        else:
            results.append("-1")
    print("\n".join(results))

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# solve()
```

### Conclusion

The original code calculates the LCM, which is a crucial step, but it does not provide the bets. To be correct, the code should derive the bets from the LCM and check the conditions. Therefore, the original code is **incorrect** as it does not provide the bets.

Correctness: **False**
