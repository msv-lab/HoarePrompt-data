The provided code snippet does not actually execute any operations that modify the `number` or `sequence` variables, nor does it generate any sequence or return any value. The code is just a function definition with a docstring explaining what the function is supposed to do, but the function body itself is empty.

Given that there are no operations to execute, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **number is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and sequence is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for each test case.**
