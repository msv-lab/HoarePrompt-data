The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the specific integer value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**
