The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the combinations of numbers in the list and prints this value. Specifically, it counts the number of ways to choose 3 or more identical numbers and the number of ways to choose 2 identical numbers multiplied by the sum of counts of all different numbers, and sums these values to produce the result for each test case.
