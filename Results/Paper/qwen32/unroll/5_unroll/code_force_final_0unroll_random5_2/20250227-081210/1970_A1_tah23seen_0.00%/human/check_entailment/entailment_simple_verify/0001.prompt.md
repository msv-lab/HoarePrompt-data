You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n, where `d[0]` is 0 and `d[n]` is 0, representing the balance of parentheses up to each position in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is the same as `s`; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses up to each position in `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `s` which is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")" with its length not exceeding 500,000.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the described balanced shuffle operation.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input string `n` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It then calls `func_1(n)` to compute the balanced shuffle of `n`.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balance at each position.
   - It starts with `d[0] = 0` which represents the balance before the first character.
   - It iterates over the string `s` and updates the balance for each position:
     - If the character is `(`, it increments the balance.
     - If the character is `)`, it decrements the balance.
   - The balance for each position `i+1` is stored in `d[i+1]`.
   - The last entry `d[n]` (balance after the last character) is removed because it is not needed for the shuffle operation.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted based on the balance (`x[1]`).
   - In case of ties (same balance), the sorting is stable and will maintain the original order, but the requirement specifies breaking ties in decreasing order of position. However, the Python sort is stable and will naturally maintain the order of positions with the same balance, which in this case is equivalent to sorting in decreasing order of position due to the way the dictionary is populated.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The sorted list of tuples is iterated over, and the characters corresponding to the positions are appended to the result string `ans`.
   - The final result string `ans` is returned.

### Issues:
- The sorting step does not explicitly break ties in decreasing order of position. While Python's sort is stable and will maintain the order of positions with the same balance, the problem statement specifies that ties should be broken in decreasing order of position. This is not explicitly handled in the code.
- However, due to the way the dictionary is populated (from left to right), the stable sort will naturally maintain the required order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The stable sort in Python maintains the required order, even though it is not explicitly broken in decreasing order of position.
