Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the key `0` assigned the value `0`.**

In simple terms, the string `s` remains unchanged, its length `n` remains the same, the string `ans` remains empty, and the dictionary `d` now has one entry where the key `0` is mapped to the value `0`.
