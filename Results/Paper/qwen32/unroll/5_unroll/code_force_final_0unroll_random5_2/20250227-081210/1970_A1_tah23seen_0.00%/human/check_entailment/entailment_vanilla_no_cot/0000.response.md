Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the sorting criteria. The problem statement specifies that the sorting should be done first by increasing order of prefix balance and then by decreasing order of position when there is a tie in prefix balance. However, the program sorts only by increasing order of prefix balance, without handling the tie-breaking rule.

To correct this, the sorting line should be modified to include the tie-breaking rule. Here is the corrected version of the sorting line:

```python
d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
```

This ensures that the sorting is done first by prefix balance and then by position in decreasing order when the prefix balances are the same.
