### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by using a series of `if` statements to check the hour and determine the corresponding 12-hour format and whether it is AM or PM. However, there is a mistake in the handling of the hour '00'. According to the problem description, '00:00' in 24-hour format should correspond to '12:00 AM' in 12-hour format. However, the program currently converts '00:00' to '12:00 PM', which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the conversion of '00:00' correctly, leading to incorrect output for this specific case. All other conversions appear to be correctly implemented.
