You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: For each of the t test cases, the output will be the given time in 12-hour format with AM/PM.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm). It then converts and prints this time in 12-hour format with AM/PM.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by using a series of `if-elif` statements to match each hour from '00' to '23' and assign the corresponding 12-hour format hour and AM/PM designation. However, there are several issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect AM/PM Assignment for Midnight and Noon**:
   - Midnight ('00:00') should be '12:00 AM', but the program incorrectly assigns it '12:00 PM'.
   - Noon ('12:00') should be '12:00 PM', but the program correctly assigns it '12:00 PM'.

2. **Redundant Code**:
   - The code is repetitive and can be simplified using arithmetic operations to convert the hour. This would reduce the number of lines and make the code more maintainable.

3. **Incorrect Leading Zero Handling**:
   - The program does not handle leading zeros correctly. For example, '01' should remain '01', but the program does not ensure this for all cases.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program correctly uses `sep=''` in the `print` function to avoid extra spaces, but it could be improved by using string formatting for better readability and correctness.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
