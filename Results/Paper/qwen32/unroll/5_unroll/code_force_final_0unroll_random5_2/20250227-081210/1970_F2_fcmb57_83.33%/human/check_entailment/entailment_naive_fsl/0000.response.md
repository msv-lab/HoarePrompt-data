Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that cause it to not work as expected according to the problem description.

1. **Incorrect handling of catching the Quaffle**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. This should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who is catching the Quaffle.

2. **Incorrect handling of throwing the Quaffle**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the case where the Quaffle is thrown. It should reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, but it incorrectly sets the Quaffle's position to the player's position if the player scores in their own goal. The correct logic should be:
     - If the player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the other team scores.
     - If the player throws the Quaffle into the other team's goal, the player's team scores.
     - Regardless, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

3. **Incorrect handling of goals**:
   - The code checks if the player's position is in the goals list, but it should check if the Quaffle's position is in the goals list when the player throws the Quaffle.

4. **Incorrect handling of player elimination**:
   - The code correctly prints the elimination of players when they collide with the Bludger, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle.

Here is a corrected version of the program with these issues fixed:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        z = ''
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    z = k
            if z != '':
                del players[z]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]  # Corrected assignment
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quidditch[1] != '':
            if quidditch[0] in goals['R']:
                if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                    pointsb += 1
                    print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                else:
                    pointsr += 1
                    print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            elif quidditch[0] in goals['B']:
                if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                    pointsr += 1
                    print(i, 'RED GOAL')
                else:
                    pointsb += 1
                    print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch = [middle, '']  # Reset Quaffle to the middle
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should work as expected according to the problem description.
