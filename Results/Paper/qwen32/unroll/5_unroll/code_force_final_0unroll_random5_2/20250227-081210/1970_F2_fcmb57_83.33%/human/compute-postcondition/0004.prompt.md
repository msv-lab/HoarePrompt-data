You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of rows (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd; b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is represented by a list of N strings, each string containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities on the field. There are T lines following the field description, where each line contains an action performed by an entity in the field. T is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game, where 0 <= T <= 10000. Each action line contains a pair of characters representing the entity performing the action, followed by a space and a character (U, D, L, R, C, or T) representing the action. If the action is C, it is followed by a space and a pair of characters representing the ball caught by the player.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (a + b, a + b) where `a` is an integer representing the number of rows (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd; `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer representing the number of rows (N) in the field, ranging from 3 to 99 and is odd, and `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, ranging from 3 to 99 and is odd. The function returns a tuple `(a + b, a + b)`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns (a + b, a + b) where `a` is an integer representing the number of rows (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd; `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
