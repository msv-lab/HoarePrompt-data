You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function will receive multiple test cases. For each test case, it will first receive an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. Following this, it will receive 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function should handle up to 5000 such test cases.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: The `final` list contains the sum of the smaller numbers for each pair of integers in each test case.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: the printed values of each element in the `final` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard, followed by 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function processes up to 5000 such test cases and returns the result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
