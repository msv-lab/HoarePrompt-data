Precondition: **The function will receive multiple test cases. For each test case, it will first receive an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. Following this, it will receive 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function should handle up to 5000 such test cases.**
