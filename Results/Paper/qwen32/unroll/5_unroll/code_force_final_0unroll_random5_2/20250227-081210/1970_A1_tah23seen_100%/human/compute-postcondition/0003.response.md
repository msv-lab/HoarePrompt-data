The code snippet `d[0] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `0` in the dictionary `d`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the key `0` having the value `0`.**
