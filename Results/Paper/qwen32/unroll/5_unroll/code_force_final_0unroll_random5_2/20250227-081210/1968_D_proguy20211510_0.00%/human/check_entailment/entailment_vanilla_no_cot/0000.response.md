Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all the cases described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of cycles in the permutation and the optimal strategy for both players. The approach of simply checking if the maximum value in the array `a` is at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha and then simulating the game for `k` turns is insufficient. 

Here are some issues with the program:
1. **Cycle Handling**: The program does not account for cycles in the permutation. If Bodya or Sasha enters a cycle, they will keep repeating the same positions and scores, and the program does not correctly calculate the scores for such cases.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: The program assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value in the array `a`, they will stay there, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy. Players can potentially gain more points by moving to different positions in the permutation.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the scores for all possible moves. It only considers the case where players stay at their current positions or move to `p_x` in the next turn, but it does not consider the optimal sequence of moves over `k` turns.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as detecting cycles in the permutation and calculating the scores for each player considering the cycles and the optimal moves.
