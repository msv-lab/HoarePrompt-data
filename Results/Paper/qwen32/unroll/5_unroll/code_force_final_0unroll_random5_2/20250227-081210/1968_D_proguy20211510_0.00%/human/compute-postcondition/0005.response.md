Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists: a permutation `p` of `n` integers and an array `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
