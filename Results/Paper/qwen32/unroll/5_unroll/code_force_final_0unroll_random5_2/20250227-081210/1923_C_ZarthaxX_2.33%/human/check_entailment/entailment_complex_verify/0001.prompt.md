You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i is such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]

        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: - `ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index.
    #   - `sum[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, with each element decreased by 1.

    #Let's formalize this understanding in the output state format:

    #Output State:
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to the `i-1` index. `sum[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `nums` list up to the `i-1` index, with each element decreased by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function determines if a specific condition is met within the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]` and prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of array `a` should be equal to the sum of array `b`.
2. **Difference Condition**: Each element of array `a` should be different from the corresponding element of array `b`.
3. **Positive Condition**: Each element of array `b` should be positive.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `c` and a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray, and the program needs to determine if this subarray is "good".

The program uses two auxiliary arrays:
- `ones`: This array keeps track of the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 in the array `c`.
- `sum`: This array keeps track of the cumulative sum of the array `c` minus the number of elements (which is equivalent to the cumulative sum of `c[i] - 1`).

For each query, the program calculates:
- `onesInRange`: The number of elements equal to 1 within the specified subarray.
- `sumInRange`: The sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.

The key condition checked is:
```
2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange
```
This can be simplified to:
```
onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange
```
Let's break down why this condition works:
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
- `(r - l + 1)` is the length of the subarray.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements.

For the subarray to be "good":
1. If there are any 1s in the subarray, they can be changed to 2s (since 2 > 1 and 2 ≠ 1).
2. For other elements, we need to ensure that we can change them to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.

The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` ensures that:
- The sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least as large as the number of elements.
- This allows us to change each 1 to 2 and other elements to a different positive integer while keeping the sum unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. It efficiently computes the necessary values using prefix sums and checks the condition for each query.
