Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for every potential case, as required by the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of X:**
   - The code attempts to generate an array by repeatedly dividing X by 2 and subtracting 1 when X is odd. This approach does not ensure that the final array will have exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The logic for generating the array is flawed and does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle small values of X correctly. For example, for X = 2, the code might not generate an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
   - The code does not handle large values of X correctly either. For example, for X = 13, the code might not generate an array with exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The problem requires a specific construction of the array to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences. The current approach does not follow any known algorithm or method to achieve this.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:

Let's consider the input X = 2:

- The code might generate an array like `[0]` or `[100000000]`, which does not have exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
- The correct output for X = 2 should be an array like `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing both elements.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
