Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic in the program does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X. Instead, it appears to be attempting to construct an array based on a binary representation of X, but this does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences. The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to construct the array, such as using specific patterns or mathematical constructions that ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences.
