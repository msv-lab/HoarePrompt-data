You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then computes the sum of every other element from the sorted list of integers (starting from the first element) and prints this sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the score by performing n moves, each time picking two numbers from the list and adding the smaller of the two to the score. The optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest available numbers because adding the smaller number to the score will maximize the score in the long run.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and then the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the list of integers. This is a key step because it allows us to easily pick the smallest numbers.
   
3. **Choosing Pairs:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list, picking every second number starting from the first one. This ensures that it always picks the smallest number in each pair, maximizing the score.
   - It adds these selected numbers to `list2`.
   
4. **Calculating Score:**
   - The program calculates the sum of `list2` and appends this sum to the `out` list, which will store the results for each test case.
   
5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly implements the strategy of picking the smallest numbers to maximize the score.
- It handles multiple test cases and processes each test case independently.
- The sorting step ensures that the smallest numbers are chosen optimally.
- The program correctly sums up the chosen numbers and outputs the results.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. It follows the optimal strategy and handles the input/output requirements properly.

Correctness: **True**
