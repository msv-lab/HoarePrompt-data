The given loop iterates over the list `out` and prints each element. However, the loop does not modify any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, or `out` itself; it only prints the values contained in `out`. Therefore, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7; `num` is a string read from input; `out` is a list containing the sums of the selected elements from each test case.**
