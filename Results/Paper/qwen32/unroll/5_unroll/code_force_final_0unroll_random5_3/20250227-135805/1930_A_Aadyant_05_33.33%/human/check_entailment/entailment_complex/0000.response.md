### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Reading**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and then reads a list of `2n` integers.
3. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted.
4. **Choosing Minimum Pairs**: The program then iterates through the sorted list, picking every other element starting from the first one, which corresponds to the smallest elements in each pair.
5. **Summing the Minimums**: It sums these selected elements (which are the minimums of each pair) to get the score for the test case.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

The strategy of sorting the list and then picking every other element starting from the first one ensures that you are always picking the smaller number in each pair, thereby maximizing the score as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Given the problem description and the explanation of the program, the approach taken by the program is optimal and correct. The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case as described, and outputs the correct maximum score for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
