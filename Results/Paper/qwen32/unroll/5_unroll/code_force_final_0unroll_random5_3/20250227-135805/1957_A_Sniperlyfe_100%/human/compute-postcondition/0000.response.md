The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This action does not affect the existing list `arr` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The dictionary `freq` is ready to be used for storing frequency data but has not been populated with any data yet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**
