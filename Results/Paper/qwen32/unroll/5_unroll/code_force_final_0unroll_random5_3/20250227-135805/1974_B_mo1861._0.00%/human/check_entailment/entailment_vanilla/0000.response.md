Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - Construct a string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` by its symmetric character from `r`. The first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given the encoded string `b`, we need to reverse the encoding process to get back the original string `s`.
   - The decoding process involves:
     - Constructing the string `r` by finding all unique characters in `b` and sorting them alphabetically.
     - Mapping each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
     - Using this mapping to decode each character in `b` to get the original string `s`.

### Program Analysis:
Here's the provided program, broken down:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Constructing the Mapping:**
     - `char_map = {}`: This dictionary will map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
     - `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):`: This line constructs the string `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`. For each character `c` at index `i` in this sorted list, it calculates its symmetric counterpart as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. However, this part of the code is incorrect. The symmetric character should be the character at the mirrored position in the sorted list `r`, not a character derived from 'a'.
     - The correct way to map each character `c` to its symmetric counterpart is to map `c` to the character at index `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted list `r`.

   - **Decoding the String:**
     - `s = ''`: Initializes an empty string to build the decoded string.
     - `for c in b: s += char_map[c]`: This correctly uses the mapping to decode each character in `b` to form the original string `s`.

### Corrected Mapping Construction:
To correctly map each character `c` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`, the code should be:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {r[i]: r[len(r) - i - 1] for i in range(len(r))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it incorrectly constructs the mapping of characters. The mapping should be based on the symmetric positions within the sorted list of unique characters, not derived from 'a'.

**Correctness: False**
