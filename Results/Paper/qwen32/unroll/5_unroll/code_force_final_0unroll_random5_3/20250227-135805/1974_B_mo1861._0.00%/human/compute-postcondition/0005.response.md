In the given task, the for loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `b`. To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variable `b` and the loop variable `c`.

### Analysis:
- **Loop Variable `c`:** This variable will take on the value of each character in the string `b` during each iteration of the loop.
- **String `b`:** The loop will execute once for each character in `b`. Therefore, `b` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.

### Required Adjustments:
- **String `b`:** It must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. The state of `b` before the loop should reflect this.
- **Variable `c`:** This variable is initialized by the loop itself, so there is no need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the string `b`, which must have at least one character. The state of `char_map` and `s` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `b` to a character in the range from 'a' to 'z', starting from 'z' and moving downwards in descending order based on the sorted order of the unique characters in `b`; `s` is an empty string; `b` must be a string with at least one character.**
