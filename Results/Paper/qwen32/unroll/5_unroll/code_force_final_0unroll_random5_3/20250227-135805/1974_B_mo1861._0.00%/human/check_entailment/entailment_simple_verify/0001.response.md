### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - Construct a new string `r` from the distinct letters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given the encoded string `b`, we need to reverse the encoding process to retrieve the original string `s`.
   - This involves mapping each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` based on the symmetric mapping defined by `r`.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Building the Character Map:**
     - The program constructs a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form `r`.
     - For each character `c` in `r`, it calculates its symmetric character in `r` and stores the mapping in `char_map`.
     - The symmetric character of `c` is determined by `char_map[c] = r[-i-1]`, which is correct. This maps each character `c` in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Decoding the String:**
   - The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

#### Annotations:
- **State before function call:** `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `b` is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The function `func_1` is called once for each test case.
- **State during `char_map` construction:** `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.
- **State during string `s` construction:** `s` is a string where each character in the original string `b` has been replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The program correctly constructs the symmetric mapping in `char_map` and uses it to decode the string `b`.

#### Conclusion:
The original program is correct because it accurately constructs the symmetric mapping of characters in `r` and uses it to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
