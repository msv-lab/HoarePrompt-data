The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. The initial state of the variables `b`, `n`, and `t` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The only change is the introduction of the `char_map` dictionary, which is set to be empty.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `b` is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The function `func_1` is called once for each test case, and the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings `b` across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
