You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a unique character from 'z' to 'a', mapping the lexicographically smallest character in `b` to 'z', the next smallest to 'y', and so on.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly performs the decoding task as described in the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - Construct a new string `r` from the distinct letters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given the encoded string `b`, we need to reverse the encoding process to retrieve the original string `s`.
   - This involves mapping each character in `b` back to its original character in `s` based on the symmetric mapping defined by `r`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Building the Character Map:**
     - The program constructs a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form `r`.
     - For each character `c` in `r`, it calculates its symmetric character in `r` and stores the mapping in `char_map`.
     - The symmetric character of `c` is determined by `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should map `c` to the character at the symmetric position in `r`, not in the alphabet.
   - **Decoding the String:**
     - The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Symmetric Mapping:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the symmetric character by using the length of `b` instead of the length of `r`. This leads to incorrect mappings.
  - The correct approach is to map each character `c` in `r` to the character at the symmetric position in `r`, not in the alphabet.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the program, we need to correctly map each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the wrong method of calculating the symmetric character. The corrected version of the program is provided above.

Correctness: **False**
