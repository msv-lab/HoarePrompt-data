### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the k-th card in a specific ordering of cards. The ordering is based on laying down odd numbers first, then multiples of 2 of odd numbers, then multiples of 3 of odd numbers, and so on, until all cards are laid down.

The program uses a binary search-like approach to determine the k-th card. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `s` (sum) is initialized to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative count of cards processed so far.
   - `m` (multiplier) is initialized to 1, which represents the current multiple being considered (starting with odd numbers).

2. **Loop:**
   - In each iteration, it calculates `x`, the number of cards that are multiples of `m` and have not yet been laid down. This is done by `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - It then updates `n` by dividing it by 2, effectively reducing the problem size.
   - If `k` falls within the range `[s + 1, s + x]`, it breaks out of the loop. This means the k-th card is among the multiples of `m` that have not yet been laid down.
   - If `k` is outside this range, it updates `s` by adding `x` (the number of cards just processed) and multiplies `m` by 2 to consider the next multiple.

3. **Output:**
   - Once the loop breaks, it calculates the exact position of the k-th card among the multiples of `m` using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- For `n = 7` and `k = 1`:
  - `s = 0`, `m = 1`
  - `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4` (odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7)
  - Since `k = 1` is within `[1, 4]`, it breaks the loop.
  - The k-th card is `(2 * (1 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 1`.

- For `n = 7` and `k = 5`:
  - `s = 0`, `m = 1`
  - `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4` (odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7)
  - `s = 4`, `m = 2`
  - `x = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2` (multiples of 2: 2, 6)
  - Since `k = 5` is within `[5, 6]`, it breaks the loop.
  - The k-th card is `(2 * (5 - 4) - 1) * 2 = 2`.

- For `n = 7` and `k = 7`:
  - `s = 0`, `m = 1`
  - `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4` (odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7)
  - `s = 4`, `m = 2`
  - `x = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2` (multiples of 2: 2, 6)
  - `s = 6`, `m = 4`
  - `x = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1` (multiples of 4: 4)
  - Since `k = 7` is within `[7, 7]`, it breaks the loop.
  - The k-th card is `(2 * (7 - 6) - 1) * 4 = 4`.

The program correctly handles the logic for determining the k-th card in the sequence, and the provided test cases match the expected output.
