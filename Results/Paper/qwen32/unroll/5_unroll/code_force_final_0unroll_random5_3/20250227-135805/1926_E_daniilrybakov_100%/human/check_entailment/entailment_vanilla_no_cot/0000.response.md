Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card Vladislav lays down according to the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Binary Representation and Counting**: The program uses a binary representation approach to count the cards. It divides the problem into segments where each segment represents cards that are multiples of a power of 2 times an odd number.

3. **Finding the Segment**: The `while` loop iteratively determines which segment the k-th card belongs to. It keeps track of the cumulative count of cards (`s`) and the current multiplier (`m`). When it finds the correct segment, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Calculating the Card**: Once the segment is identified, the program calculates the exact card number using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`. This formula accounts for the position within the segment and the multiplier for that segment.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the k-th card.

The logic and the implementation are consistent with the problem statement, and the program efficiently handles the constraints provided (up to \( n, k \leq 10^9 \)). Therefore, the program is correct.
