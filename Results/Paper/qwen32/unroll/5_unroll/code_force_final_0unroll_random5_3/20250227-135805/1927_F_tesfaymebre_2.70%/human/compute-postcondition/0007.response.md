Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the depth-first search with `curr` appended to it, and the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is equal to 2.**

In natural language: The color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) has been changed to 2. All other variables (`curr`, `parent`, `path`) remain unchanged.
