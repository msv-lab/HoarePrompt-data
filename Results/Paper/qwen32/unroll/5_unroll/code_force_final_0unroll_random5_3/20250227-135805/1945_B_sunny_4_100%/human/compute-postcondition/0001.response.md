`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they hold the values from the last test case.

Output State: **Each test case has been processed, `t` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `m` hold the values from the last test case.**
