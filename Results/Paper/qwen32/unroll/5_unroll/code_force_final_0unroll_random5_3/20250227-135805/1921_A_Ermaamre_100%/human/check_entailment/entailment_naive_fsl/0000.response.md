Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and then squaring this difference. However, this approach does not correctly account for the side length of the square, which could be determined by the y-coordinates as well. The side length of the square should be the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

Let's consider a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
0 0
0 5
5 0
5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
25
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
25
```

This specific case works because the side length is determined by the x-coordinates. However, consider another case:

Input:
```
1
0 0
5 0
0 5
5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
25
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
25
```

This case also works because the side length is determined by the x-coordinates. However, consider a case where the side length is determined by the y-coordinates:

Input:
```
1
0 0
5 0
0 5
5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
25
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
25
```

This case works as well, but consider the following case:

Input:
```
1
0 0
0 10
10 0
10 10
```

Expected Output:
```
100
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
100
```

This case works as well, but consider the following case:

Input:
```
1
0 0
10 0
0 15
10 15
```

Expected Output:
```
150
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
100
```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the area as 100, whereas the correct area should be 150, because the side length is determined by the y-coordinates (15).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle cases where the side length of the square is determined by the y-coordinates.
