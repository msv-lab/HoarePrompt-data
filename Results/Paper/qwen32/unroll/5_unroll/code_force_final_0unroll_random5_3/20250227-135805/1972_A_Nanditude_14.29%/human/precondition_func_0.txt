arr is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and then a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
