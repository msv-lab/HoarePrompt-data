Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

### Problem Recap
The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the array in ascending order.
   - **Calculating Beauty**: It then calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
     - **Annotation**: The annotation correctly states that after sorting, the beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
     - **Logic**: Sorting in ascending order (or descending order) ensures that the maximum possible differences are captured between consecutive elements.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads the input from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and processes each test case.
   - **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the number of elements, the elements themselves, and then calculates the beauty using `func_1`.
   - **Printing Results**: It stores the results for each test case and prints them at the end.
     - **Annotation**: The annotation correctly describes the state of the program after processing each test case and printing the results.

### Correctness Verification

- **Sorting Strategy**: Sorting the array in ascending (or descending) order is a valid strategy to maximize the beauty because it maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **All Elements the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty is 0, which is correctly handled by the program.
  - **Two Elements**: For two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements, which is correctly calculated.
  - **Larger Arrays**: The program handles arrays up to the maximum size specified (100 elements).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct.

**Final: True**
