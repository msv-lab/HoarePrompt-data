Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the elements of the array in any way we like.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Function `func_1(array)`

- **Sorting the Array**: The function sorts the array. Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, the second smallest and second largest, and so on.
- **Calculating Beauty**: The function iterates through the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Function `func_2()`

- **Reading Input**: The function reads the entire input at once, splits it into a list of strings, and then processes each test case.
- **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the number of elements, the elements themselves, and then calculates the beauty using `func_1`.
- **Printing Results**: It stores the results for each test case and prints them at the end.

### Correctness Verification

The key idea here is that sorting the array in either ascending or descending order will yield the maximum beauty. The provided program sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty correctly. The logic is sound, and it handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Edge Cases Considered

- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements are the same, the beauty will be 0, as the differences between consecutive elements will be 0.
- **Two Elements**: For two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Larger Arrays**: The program handles arrays up to the maximum size specified (100 elements).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly for all possible test cases, including edge cases like all elements being the same, arrays with only two elements, and larger arrays up to the maximum size specified.
