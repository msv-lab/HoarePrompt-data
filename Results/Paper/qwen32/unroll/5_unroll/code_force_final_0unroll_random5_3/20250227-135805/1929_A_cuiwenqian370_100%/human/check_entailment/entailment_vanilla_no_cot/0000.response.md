To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solves the problem as described.

### Analysis of the Problem

The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this beauty, the strategy is to arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated beauty.
   
   This function correctly implements the strategy of sorting the array to maximize the beauty.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Reading**: The function reads input from standard input, parses it, and processes each test case.
   - **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the array, calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty, and stores the result.
   - **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   
   This function correctly handles multiple test cases and processes them as specified.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
