### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the elements in any way. The beauty is calculated as:

\[ \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}| \]

The key insight to maximize this beauty is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then considering the differences between adjacent elements in the sorted array. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided solution:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The `func_1` function sorts the array. Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized because the largest numbers are placed next to the smallest numbers in the sorted order.

2. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - After sorting, the function calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between each pair of consecutive elements.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The `func_2` function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints (with \( n \leq 100 \)), sorting the array and calculating the beauty as described is efficient and correct.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the solution with one of the provided examples:

**Input:**
```
5
3
2 1 3
3
69 69 69
5
100 54 80 43 90
4
3 4 3 3
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0
57
1
1
```

**Explanation:**
- For the first test case, the array can be sorted to `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is \( (2-1) + (3-2) = 2 \).
- For the second test case, the array is already uniform, so the beauty is \( 0 \).
- For the third test case, sorting the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` gives the beauty \( (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \).
- For the fourth test case, sorting the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` results in a beauty of \( (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).
- For the fifth test case, sorting the array to `[1, 2]` gives a beauty of \( (2-1) = 1 \).

The solution correctly computes the expected results for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
