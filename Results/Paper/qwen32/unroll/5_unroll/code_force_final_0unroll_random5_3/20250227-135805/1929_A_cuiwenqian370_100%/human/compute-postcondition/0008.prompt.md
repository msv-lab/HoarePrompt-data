Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - After all iterations, `index` will have been incremented by `1` for each iteration (to get `n`), and by `n` for each iteration (to get the `array` elements). Therefore, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_i)`, where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the `i-th` iteration.
   - `results` will contain `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(array)` for the respective `array` in each iteration.
   - `array` will hold the last `array` that was processed in the loop.
   - `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given that `func_1(array)` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of the `results` list. However, we can describe the state of the variables as follows:

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
