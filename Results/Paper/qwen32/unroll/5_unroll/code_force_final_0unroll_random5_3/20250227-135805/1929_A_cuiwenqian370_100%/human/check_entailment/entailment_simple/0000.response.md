### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The function `func_1(array)` sorts the array. Sorting the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty because the difference between consecutive elements will be maximized.

2. **Calculating Beauty**:
   - After sorting, the function calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, the absolute difference is simply the difference between consecutive elements.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases. It reads the input, processes each test case, and stores the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as arrays with all identical elements (beauty is 0) and arrays with only two elements.

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - The function `func_1(array)` is correctly defined and called within `func_2()`. The input reading and processing logic in `func_2()` is also correct.

Given the provided annotated program, the logic and implementation are correct for solving the problem as described. The program reads multiple test cases, processes each one by sorting the array and calculating the beauty, and then outputs the results.
