The given code snippet calls a function `func_1` with arguments derived from the initial state variables. Let's calculate the specific values of these arguments:

1. `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`:
   - `number` is 10.
   - `1 << size` is `1 << 3` which equals 8.
   - `1 << overlap` is `1 << 0` which equals 1.
   - Therefore, `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` becomes `10 - 8 + 1` which equals 3.

2. The second argument to `func_1` is `sequence`, which remains `[3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2]`.

The function `func_1` is called with these arguments, but since the function's definition and its side effects are not provided, we can only describe the output state based on the given code snippet.

Output State: **`number` is 10, `sequence` is [3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2], `size_overlap` is (3, 0), `size` is 3, `overlap` is 0, and `func_1` is called with arguments (3, [3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 2])**.
