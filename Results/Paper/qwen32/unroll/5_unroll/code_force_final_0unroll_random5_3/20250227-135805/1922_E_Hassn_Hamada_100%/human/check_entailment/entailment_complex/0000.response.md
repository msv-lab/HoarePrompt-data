Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the required sequence, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented and does not produce the expected results as per the problem statement.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. The function `func_1` always returns `(0, 0)` regardless of the input, which does not contribute to building the sequence.
2. The logic inside `func_1` for calculating the sequence is incorrect. It does not properly calculate the required elements to form the desired number of increasing subsequences.
3. The initial call to `func_1` is incorrect because it passes `n - 1` instead of the actual number of increasing subsequences `n`.
4. The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to find such an array, which should result in printing `-1`.

Given these issues, the program cannot correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
