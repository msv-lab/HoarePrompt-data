Let's analyze the provided Python program and its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`, which is the number of increasing subsequences required.

2. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1` with `n-1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences required.
   - The function uses a loop to determine the size of the sequence and the value to append to the sequence.
   - The function recursively calls itself to adjust the number of subsequences until the required number is achieved.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence.
   - It then prints the sequence itself.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the logic inside the function is not clearly explained or correct for achieving this goal.
   - The function uses bitwise operations and conditions that do not seem to directly relate to generating an increasing subsequence with the exact count `X`.
   - The base case `if number == 0: return (0, 0)` does not contribute to the sequence generation.
   - The loop and conditions inside `func_1` do not ensure that the sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Sequence Generation Logic**:
   - The logic to generate the sequence is flawed. It does not ensure that the sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence generated by the function does not seem to follow any clear pattern that guarantees the exact count of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output**:
   - The output of the program does not match the expected output for the given examples.
   - The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to generate such a sequence (it should return `-1`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed and does not ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences. The program also does not handle the case where it is impossible to generate such a sequence.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
