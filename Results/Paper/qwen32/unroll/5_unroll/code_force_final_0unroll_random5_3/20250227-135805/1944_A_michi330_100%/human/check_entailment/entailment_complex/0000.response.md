### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges optimally.

Initially, all islands are connected. The key insight is that if Dominater destroys `n-1` or more bridges, it is always possible to isolate island 1 from all other islands. This is because a tree with `n` nodes requires `n-1` edges (or bridges, in this context) to remain connected. By destroying `n-1` bridges, Dominater can break all connections from island 1 to the other islands, leaving Everule isolated on island 1.

Conversely, if Dominater destroys fewer than `n-1` bridges, it is not possible to isolate island 1 from all other islands. This is because at least one path will remain, allowing Everule to visit more than one island.

The given program correctly implements this logic. It checks if the number of bridges that can be destroyed (`k`) is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If so, it outputs `1`, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, it outputs `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all islands.
