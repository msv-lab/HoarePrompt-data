You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of islands (`n`) and the maximum number of bridges (`k`) that can be destroyed. For each test case, it outputs `1` if the number of bridges that can be destroyed is at least `n - 1`; otherwise, it outputs `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a graph where each of the `n` islands is initially connected to every other island by a bridge. This means the graph starts as a complete graph with `n` vertices. Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges, aiming to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach starting from island 1.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **Complete Graph**: Initially, in a complete graph with `n` vertices, there are `n*(n-1)/2` edges (bridges).
2. **Dominater's Action**: Dominater's strategy is to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying bridges.
3. **Everule's Reach**: Everule starts on island 1. If Dominater can disconnect all other islands from island 1, Everule will only be able to visit island 1.

### Optimal Strategy:
- **If `k >= n - 1`**: Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect all other islands from island 1. This is because to keep a tree structure (which is the minimum connected structure) with `n` vertices, you need `n-1` edges. If `k` is at least `n-1`, Dominater can remove these edges, leaving island 1 isolated.
- **If `k < n - 1`**: Dominater cannot disconnect all other islands from island 1 because there are not enough bridges to destroy to isolate island 1 completely. In this case, Everule can still reach all `n` islands.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy). It then checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`:
- If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1` (only island 1 is reachable).
- If `k < n - 1`, it prints `n` (all islands are reachable).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the observations above. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
