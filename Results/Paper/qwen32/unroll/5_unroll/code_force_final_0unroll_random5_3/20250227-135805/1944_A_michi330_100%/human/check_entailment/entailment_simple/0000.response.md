### Reasoning:

The problem statement requires us to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges optimally. Initially, all islands are connected, and Everule starts on island 1.

Here's the breakdown of the logic:

- **If `k >= n - 1`:** Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. This is because to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Dominater needs to destroy `n - 1` bridges (one to each of the other `n - 1` islands). If `k` is at least `n - 1`, island 1 can be isolated, and Everule can only visit island 1. Hence, the output should be `1`.

- **If `k < n - 1`:** Dominater cannot destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. There will always be a way for Everule to reach at least some of the other islands, so the output should be `n` (all islands are reachable).

The provided code correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It then checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, it prints `1` (island 1 is isolated). Otherwise, it prints `n` (all islands are reachable).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases as per the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
