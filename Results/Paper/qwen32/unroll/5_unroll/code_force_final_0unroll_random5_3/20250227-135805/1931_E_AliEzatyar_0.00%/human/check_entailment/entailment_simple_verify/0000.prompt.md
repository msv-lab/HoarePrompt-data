You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

    1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
    
    4 5
    
    10 10 10 10

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Typographical Error**: The program prints `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'` when Sasha wins. This is a simple typo and should be corrected.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic of the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to count the number of trailing zeros in the numbers and uses this to determine the winner, but this does not align with the rules of the game.

3. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros in a number, but the program does not use this information correctly to simulate Anna's and Sasha's turns.

4. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The problem description mentions that leading zeros are removed when reversing a number. The program does not handle leading zeros when reversing numbers.

5. **Concatenation of Numbers**: The program does not correctly simulate Sasha's turn where he concatenates two numbers. It simply sums the lengths of the numbers and subtracts the count of trailing zeros, which does not reflect the actual concatenation process.

6. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**: The program calculates `total_digits` as the sum of the lengths of the numbers, but it does not account for the fact that the numbers might be concatenated in different ways, affecting the final number of digits.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when there is only one number in the list or when all numbers are single digits.

Here is one potential case where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Anna
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Sasha
```

In this case, Anna can reverse the number 9 to 9, 56 to 65, and 1 to 1. Sasha can then concatenate 65 and 1 to get 651, which is less than 10^5. Therefore, Anna wins. However, the program incorrectly determines that Sasha wins.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
