#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and m, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `num` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and m, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `counter` is 0.
    return counter
    #The program returns counter which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers and a list of integers. It returns the count of trailing '0' strings from the end of the list, but due to the current implementation, it always returns 0 regardless of the input.
