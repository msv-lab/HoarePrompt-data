Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Typographical Error in Output**: The program outputs `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`. This is a straightforward typo that needs to be corrected.

2. **Logic Error in Counting Leading Zeros**: The function `func_1` counts trailing zeros rather than leading zeros. The problem statement specifies that leading zeros should be removed after reversing the digits, not counted.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**: The program calculates `total_digits` as the sum of the lengths of the numbers in the list, which does not account for the removal of leading zeros after reversing the digits. This is a critical error because it affects the final comparison with `m`.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Sasha's Moves**: The program only considers the effect of removing leading zeros from numbers that Anna reverses. However, Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, which can significantly affect the final result. The program does not account for this aspect of the game.

5. **Incorrect Strategy for Winning Condition**: The program attempts to determine the winner based on the difference between `total_digits` and the sum of leading zeros (after reversing) that Sasha can remove. This strategy is not sufficient to determine the winner because it does not consider Sasha's ability to concatenate numbers and the optimal moves of both players.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive strategy is needed, taking into account both players' moves and the optimal outcomes. The provided program does not implement such a strategy and, therefore, is incorrect.
