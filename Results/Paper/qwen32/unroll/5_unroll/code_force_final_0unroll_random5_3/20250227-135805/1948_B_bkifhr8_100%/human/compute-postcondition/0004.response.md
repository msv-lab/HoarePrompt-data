Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be rearranged such that each number is non-decreasing by potentially merging adjacent numbers. It prints "YES" if the list can be rearranged in this manner, otherwise "NO".**
