Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 <= a_i <= 99). For each test case, the function returns a specific value based on the conditions defined in the test cases.**
