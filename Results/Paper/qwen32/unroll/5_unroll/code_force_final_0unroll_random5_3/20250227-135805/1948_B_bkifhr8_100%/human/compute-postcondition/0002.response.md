To determine the output state, we need to carefully analyze the provided loop and understand the transformations it performs on the input data. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the loop's behavior:

1. The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list `arr` of `m` integers.
3. It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`.
4. The inner loop iterates from the end of the list `arr` to the beginning (excluding the first element).
5. For each pair of adjacent elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]`:
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, it checks if the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]` form a sorted sequence.
   - If they do not form a sorted sequence, `ans` is set to `False`, and the inner loop breaks.
   - If they do form a sorted sequence, the first digit of `arr[i-1]` is kept, and the rest are discarded.
6. After the inner loop, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

Let's consider the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop:

- `t`: This variable is not modified within the loop and remains the same as the initial state.
- `n`: This variable is not modified within the loop and remains the same as the initial state.
- `a`: This variable is not used within the loop and remains the same as the initial state.

The output of the loop is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the condition inside the loop. Since we are asked to describe the output state in terms of the variables, and the loop itself does not modify `t`, `n`, or `a`, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; n is the integer input provided (2 <= n <= 50); a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.**
