#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length `n` and returns the maximum count between the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1', and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'.
