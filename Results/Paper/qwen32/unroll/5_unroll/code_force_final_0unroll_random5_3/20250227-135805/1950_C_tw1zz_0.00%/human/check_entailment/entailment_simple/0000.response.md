### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to convert times from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with AM/PM. However, there are several issues with the program that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling of '00' Hour:** The program incorrectly assigns "12 PM" to "00:00". According to the problem description, "00:00" should be converted to "12:00 AM".
2. **Redundant and Inefficient Code:** The program contains repetitive code blocks for each hour from 0 to 23. This can be simplified using a single conditional statement or a dictionary to map 24-hour format hours to 12-hour format hours.
3. **Leading Zeros:** The program does not ensure that the hour in the 12-hour format retains leading zeros when necessary (e.g., "01" instead of "1").

Let's correct these issues to verify the program's correctness:

- **'00' Hour:** Correct the mapping of "00" to "12 AM".
- **Simplification:** Use a more concise approach to handle the conversion.
- **Leading Zeros:** Ensure that the hour in the 12-hour format retains leading zeros.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = input().split(':')
        h = int(h)
        m = int(m)
        
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h12 = h
            period = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h12 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m:02} {period}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above, particularly the incorrect handling of the "00" hour and the lack of leading zero handling. The corrected version of the program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output as per the problem description.
