Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. The handling of the hour '00' is incorrect. In 12-hour format, '00:00' should be '12:00 AM', not '12:00 PM'.
2. The logic for converting the hour is repetitive and can be simplified using arithmetic operations.
3. The program does not handle hours from '13' to '23' correctly in terms of converting them to the 12-hour format. For example, '13:00' should be '01:00 PM', but the program outputs '01:00 AM'.

A more efficient and correct way to implement this conversion would involve using arithmetic to determine the 12-hour format equivalent of the hour and handling the special cases for '00' and '12' separately.

Given these issues, the program as written does not correctly convert all times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM.

Correctness: **False**
