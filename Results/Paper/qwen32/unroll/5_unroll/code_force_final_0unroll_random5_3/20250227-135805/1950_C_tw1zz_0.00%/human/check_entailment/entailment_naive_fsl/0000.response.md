Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format correctly for all cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the conversion for times between 12:00 PM and 12:59 PM. Additionally, the program incorrectly converts the time "00:00" to "12:00 PM" instead of "12:00 AM".

Here are some specific cases where the program fails:

1. **Input: 12:00**
   - Expected Output: `12:00 PM`
   - Actual Output: `12:00 AM`

2. **Input: 12:30**
   - Expected Output: `12:30 PM`
   - Actual Output: `12:30 AM`

3. **Input: 00:00**
   - Expected Output: `12:00 AM`
   - Actual Output: `12:00 PM`

The program needs to be corrected to handle these cases properly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'AM'
        elif 1 <= h <= 11:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'PM'
        elif 13 <= h <= 23:
            h1 = h - 12
            time = 'PM'
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m:02} {time}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version handles all edge cases correctly and formats the output as required.
