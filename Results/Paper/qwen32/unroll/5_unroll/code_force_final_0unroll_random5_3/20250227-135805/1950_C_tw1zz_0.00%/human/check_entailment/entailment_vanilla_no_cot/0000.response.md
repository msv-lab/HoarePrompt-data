Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the handling of the "00" hour case. The "00" hour in 24-hour format should correspond to "12:00 AM" in 12-hour format, but the program incorrectly assigns it to "12:00 PM". Here's the problematic part of the code:

```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'PM'
```

It should be:

```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'AM'
```

Additionally, the program can be optimized and simplified using modulo operations and conditional logic to reduce redundancy. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h12 = h
            period = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h12 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m:02} {period}")

func()
```

This version correctly handles all edge cases and simplifies the logic significantly.
