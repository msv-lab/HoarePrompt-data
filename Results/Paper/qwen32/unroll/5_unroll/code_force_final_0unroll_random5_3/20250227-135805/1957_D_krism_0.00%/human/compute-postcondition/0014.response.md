To determine what will be printed when the `print(suf)` statement is executed, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the `suf` list is constructed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **n**: An integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. **a**: A list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
4. **arr**: A list of integers read from the input.
5. **prefix**: A list of length `len(arr) + 1` where the \(i+1\)th element is the XOR of the first \(i\) elements of `arr`.
6. **pre**: A list of 32 sublists, each containing `[1, 0]`.
7. **suf**: A list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` indicates that `x` is the count of numbers in `prefix[1]` to `prefix[n]` with the corresponding bit as 0 and `y` is the count of numbers with the corresponding bit as 1.

### Understanding `suf`:
The `suf` list is designed to keep track of the counts of numbers in the `prefix` list that have a specific bit set to 0 or 1. There are 32 sublists because there are 32 bits in a standard integer representation (assuming 32-bit integers).

Each sublist in `suf` has the form `[x, y]`, where:
- `x` is the count of numbers in `prefix[1]` to `prefix[n]` where the corresponding bit is 0.
- `y` is the count of numbers in `prefix[1]` to `prefix[n]` where the corresponding bit is 1.

### Construction of `suf`:
The construction of `suf` involves iterating through each bit position (from 0 to 31) and counting how many numbers in the `prefix` list have that bit set to 0 and how many have it set to 1.

### Output:
Given the description, the `suf` list will contain 32 sublists, each initialized with `[0, 0]` and then updated based on the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position across the `prefix` list.

Since the exact values of `arr` and `prefix` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `suf`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the final counts for each bit position.

Output: **suf (where suf is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where x is the count of numbers in prefix[1] to prefix[n] with the corresponding bit as 0 and y is the count of numbers with the corresponding bit as 1)**
