The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `a` as they are not mentioned in the snippet. The new value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
