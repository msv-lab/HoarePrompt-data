The code snippet initializes a list named `prefix` with a single element, which is `0`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `arr`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `prefix` is a list containing a single element, `0`.**
