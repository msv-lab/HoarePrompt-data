You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers for each test case, computes a specific value based on the XOR of prefixes of the list, and prints this value. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads input values from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, then calculates and prints a result based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the bit positions of the cumulative XOR values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that:
1. 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n
2. f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)

Where f(l, r) is defined as the XOR of the elements from index l to r (inclusive).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: It calculates the prefix XOR array, where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `arr`.
3. **Pre and Suf Arrays**: The program initializes two 2D arrays `pre` and `suf` of size 32x2. These arrays are supposed to keep track of the number of prefixes and suffixes with a particular bit set or not set.
4. **Initialization**: The program initializes `pre` with 1s in the first column (indicating that initially, there is one prefix with no bits set).
5. **Suffix Calculation**: It then calculates the suffix array by iterating from the end of the prefix array to the beginning.
6. **Answer Calculation**: The program then iterates through the array, calculating the number of valid tuples (x, y, z) using the pre and suf arrays. It updates the pre and suf arrays as it goes.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic used to calculate the number of valid tuples is flawed. The program attempts to use bit manipulation to count the number of valid tuples, but it does not correctly account for the XOR operation properties and the conditions specified in the problem.
2. **Incorrect Initialization**: The initialization of the `pre` array is incorrect. It should not be initialized with 1s in the first column.
3. **Incorrect Update Logic**: The update logic for the `pre` and `suf` arrays is incorrect. It does not correctly reflect the XOR properties and the conditions of the problem.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic and the initialization, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
