Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem. Here are some key issues:

1. **Function Call and Structure**: The main loop in the program calls a function `func_1()` which is not defined properly within the context of the problem. It should be integrated directly into the main loop or properly defined.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR calculation is correctly done, but it is not used effectively in the context of the problem. The prefix array is used to calculate the XOR of any subarray efficiently, but the logic for counting the tuples is flawed.

3. **Counting Tuples**: The logic for counting the tuples (x, y, z) such that \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \) is not correctly implemented. The program incorrectly uses bit positions to count tuples, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Bitwise Operations Misuse**: The program attempts to use bitwise operations to count the number of valid tuples, but the approach is incorrect. It does not properly compare the XOR values of the subarrays as required.

5. **Output**: The program prints debug statements and does not correctly output the number of valid tuples for each test case.

To fix the program, a different approach is needed to correctly count the number of tuples that satisfy the condition \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \). This might involve nested loops to check each possible tuple (x, y, z) and using the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the required XOR values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] ^ v)
    
    ans = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(x, n + 1):
            fx_y = prefix[y] ^ prefix[x - 1]
            for z in range(y, n + 1):
                fy_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[y - 1]
                fx_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[x - 1]
                if fx_y ^ fy_z > fx_z:
                    ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This solution uses nested loops to check each possible tuple (x, y, z) and uses the prefix XOR array to efficiently compute the required XOR values. Note that this solution has a time complexity of \( O(n^3) \), which is not efficient for the problem's constraints. An optimized approach would be necessary for larger inputs.
