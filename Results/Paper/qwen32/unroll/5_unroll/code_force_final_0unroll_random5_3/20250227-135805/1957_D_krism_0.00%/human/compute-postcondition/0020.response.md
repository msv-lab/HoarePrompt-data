Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list of integers for each test case, computes a specific value based on the XOR of prefixes of the list, and prints this value. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads input values from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, then calculates and prints a result based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the bit positions of the cumulative XOR values.**
