In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer value that is obtained from the `input()` function. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value provided by the input, which is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that the input value is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The variable `_` does not need an initial state since it is assigned by the loop itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The variable `_` does not need an initial state as it is controlled by the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, we need to ensure that the input function returns this value `t`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that the input function returns a value that satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `input()` returns `t`**
