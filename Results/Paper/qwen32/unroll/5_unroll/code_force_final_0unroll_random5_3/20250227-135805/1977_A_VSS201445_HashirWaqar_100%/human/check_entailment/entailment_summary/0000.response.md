### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time. Given `n` moves, we need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

Let's break down the conditions:
1. **Total Moves (`n`)**: The total number of moves Nikita can make.
2. **Target Cubes (`m`)**: The number of cubes we want in the tower after `n` moves.

The key insight here is that each move either adds or removes one cube. This means that the difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the number of cubes (`m`) must be even. This is because:
- If `n - m` is even, it means that the difference in the number of add and remove operations can be balanced out (e.g., if `n - m = 2`, Nikita could add a cube twice, remove a cube twice, or do a combination of one add and one remove).
- If `n - m` is odd, it means there is an imbalance that cannot be resolved with the given moves (e.g., if `n - m = 1`, Nikita could not end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves because there would always be one extra operation that cannot be canceled out).

Additionally, `n` must be at least as large as `m` because if `n < m`, it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves (since each move can only add one cube).

The provided code correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if `n >= m` to ensure there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
- It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to ensure the difference is even, which allows for a balanced number of add and remove operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given conditions.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
Correctness: **True**
