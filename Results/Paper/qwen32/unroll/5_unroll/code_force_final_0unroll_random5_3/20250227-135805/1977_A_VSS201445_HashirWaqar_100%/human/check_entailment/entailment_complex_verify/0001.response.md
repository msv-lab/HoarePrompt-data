Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if Nikita can have exactly `m` cubes after performing `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube.
2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `n < m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes you can have after `n` moves is `n` (if you add one cube each move).
   - If `n >= m`, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the net change in the number of cubes is always even. For example, if `n - m` is 2, it means we can add one cube and then add another cube to reach `m` from `m-2` (or remove one cube and then another to reach `m` from `m+2`).
3. **Logic in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

Let's evaluate the annotated code to ensure the logic holds:

- The program processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It then checks if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- If both conditions are true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the logic being applied. The conditions `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` are necessary and sufficient for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem description and observations.

Final: **True**
