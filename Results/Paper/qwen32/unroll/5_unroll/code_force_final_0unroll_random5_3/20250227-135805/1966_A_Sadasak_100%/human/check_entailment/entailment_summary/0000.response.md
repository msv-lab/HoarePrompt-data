Reasoning:  
The provided Python program aims to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations. However, there are some issues with the logic of the program that need to be addressed.

1. **Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not the correct approach because the frequency of a card should not be capped at `k` for the purpose of determining the minimum number of cards left. Instead, we need to use the actual frequency of each card.

2. **Handling of Frequencies**: The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not the correct condition. Instead, we should use the formula derived from the problem: for each card number with a frequency `f`, we can reduce the count of that number to `f % (k-1)`, and the total number of cards left will be the sum of these reduced counts.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where `k > n` correctly. While it correctly prints `n` in this case, the logic for other cases needs to be fixed as mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands. The logic for reducing the number of cards based on their frequencies needs to be corrected.

Correctness: **False**
