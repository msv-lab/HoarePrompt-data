Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the described operations. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the subsequent logic for determining the output are flawed.

The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This capping does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left. Instead, we need to focus on the remainder when the frequency of each card number is divided by `k` because each group of `k` cards can be reduced to `k-1` cards.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem correctly:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each unique card number, calculate the remainder when its frequency is divided by `k`. This remainder represents the number of cards that cannot be reduced further for that number.
3. Sum these remainders. This sum gives the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced, and thus, the minimum number of cards left.

The provided code does not implement this logic correctly. Hence, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
