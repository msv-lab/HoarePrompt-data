To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` cards, each with a number.
- We can perform operations where we exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any number.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of cards left after performing any number of such operations.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Logic for `k > n`**:
   - The program correctly prints `n` if `k > n` because no operations can be performed.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to create a frequency table where each key is a unique card number and each value is the minimum of the count of that number and `k`.
   - According to the function summary, `func_1` truncates the frequency to `k`. However, this truncation is not aligned with the problem's requirements. We need the actual frequencies to determine the optimal number of cards left.

4. **Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - The program incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k-1` if true. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the actual reduction in the number of cards based on the frequency of each card number.
   - The correct approach involves:
     - Counting the actual frequency of each card number.
     - For each unique card number with frequency `f`, we can perform `(f // k)` operations, reducing the count of that card by `(f % k)`.
     - Summing these reduced counts gives the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Approach:
- Count the actual frequency of each card number.
- For each unique card number with frequency `f`, the number of cards left after performing the operations is `f % k`.
- The sum of these values for all unique card numbers gives the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it truncates frequencies and uses flawed logic to determine the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach involves using the actual frequencies and calculating the reduced counts based on the modulo operation.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
