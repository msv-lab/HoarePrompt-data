### Reasoning:
To determine the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. The beauty of the array can be maximized by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. 

One approach to achieve this is to sort the array and then pair the largest elements with the smallest elements. By doing this, we can maximize the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) because the largest possible values will be subtracted from the smallest possible values in an alternating manner.

However, the given program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead of pairing the largest and smallest elements alternately, the program calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements in a non-alternating manner. Specifically, it calculates the sum of differences as kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i] for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1). This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty of the array.

To correctly calculate the maximum beauty, we should sort the array and then compute the sum of differences in an alternating manner, such as (a_n - a_1) + (a_{n-1} - a_2) + ... This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs.
