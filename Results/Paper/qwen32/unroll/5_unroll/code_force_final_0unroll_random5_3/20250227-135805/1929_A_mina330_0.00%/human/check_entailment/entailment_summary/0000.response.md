### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array. The optimal way to achieve this is by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

The given program follows this approach:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
5. It prints the calculated sum for each test case.

The logic used in the program is correct. By sorting the array and pairing the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, the program ensures that the sum of differences is maximized.

### Correctness: **True**
