### Reasoning:

To solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. The beauty of the array is given by:

\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

The expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 + a_{n-1} - a_2 + a_{n-2} - a_3 + \ldots \]

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest elements are placed in the odd positions (considering 1-based indexing) and the smallest elements are placed in the even positions. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

However, the provided program does not follow this optimal strategy. Instead, it sorts the array and then sums up the differences between the largest and smallest elements in a specific pattern:

```python
for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
    kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
```

This loop calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements in the first half of the sorted array and the corresponding elements in the second half. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty of the array.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
