Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. Let's break down the issues step by step:

1. **Variable Mismatch:** The variables in the input are `n`, `a`, and `b`, but in the code, they are incorrectly assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means that the intended variables are not correctly mapped to the input values. Specifically, `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price for two yogurts on promotion. However, in the code, `n` is read as the number of test cases, and within the loop, `a`, `b`, and `c` are read. This should be `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic Error:** The logic to calculate the minimum cost is incorrect. The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, the comparison should be between buying yogurts individually and buying them in pairs using the promotion.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Cost:** The correct approach to find the minimum cost is:
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought using the promotion: `pairs = n // 2`.
   - Calculate the cost for these pairs: `cost_pairs = pairs * b`.
   - Calculate the number of yogurts left after buying pairs: `leftover = n % 2`.
   - Calculate the cost for the leftover yogurts: `cost_leftover = leftover * a`.
   - The total minimum cost is the sum of the cost for pairs and the cost for leftovers: `total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_leftover`.

4. **Output:** The output should be the total cost calculated for each test case.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        pairs = n // 2
        leftover = n % 2
        
        cost_pairs = pairs * b
        cost_leftover = leftover * a
        
        total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_leftover
        
        print(total_cost)

#State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; for each test case, n, a, and b are the integers read from the input; the output consists of t lines, each being the minimum cost to buy n yogurts.
```

Based on this analysis:
Correctness: **False**
