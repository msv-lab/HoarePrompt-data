### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Optimal Play Strategy**: The problem requires both players to play optimally. The function `func_1` only counts the number of pairs of cards the player has, which is not sufficient to determine the optimal strategy for either player. Nene, being very smart, will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours, which requires a more strategic approach.

2. **Game Dynamics**: The program does not account for the alternating turns and the fact that both players can see the cards on the table. The optimal strategy involves considering the state of the table and the remaining cards in both players' hands. The function `func_1` does not simulate this dynamic interaction.

3. **Example Case**: The provided example in the original assessment demonstrates a scenario where the program would output the correct score for that specific case (0 points for you), but it does not generalize to all cases. The function `func_1` does not consider the strategic decisions made by Nene, which can significantly impact the outcome of the game.

4. **General Case**: The function `func_1` only counts the pairs you have, which does not consider the strategic decisions made by Nene. To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach involving game theory or dynamic programming would be required to simulate the optimal play strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering Nene's optimal play strategy.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
