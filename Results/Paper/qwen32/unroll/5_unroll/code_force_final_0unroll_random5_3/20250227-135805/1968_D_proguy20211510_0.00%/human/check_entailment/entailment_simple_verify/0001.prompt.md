You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

The values of t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a remain unchanged after the loop execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both players start at positions with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it outputs "Draw".
   - If Bodya's starting position has the maximum value in `a`, it outputs "Bodya".
   - If Sasha's starting position has the maximum value in `a`, it outputs "Sasha".

3. **Simulation of Moves:**
   - The program simulates the moves of both players up to `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of whether either player has found the maximum value in `a` and if so, the player stays at that position for the remaining turns.
   - The scores for each player are accumulated in the lists `b` and `s`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the accumulated scores for both players in `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the potential total scores for both players for each turn, considering that if they have found the maximum value, they will stay at that position for the remaining turns. These values are stored in `ptsb` and `ptss`.

5. **Determine Winner:**
   - The program finds the maximum possible scores in `ptsb` and `ptss` for both players and compares them to determine the winner.

### Issues in the Code

- **Handling of Cycles:** The current implementation does not handle cycles in the permutation properly. If both players enter a cycle that does not contain the maximum value in `a`, the program may incorrectly assume that they will continue to gain points from the maximum value.
- **Scoring Mechanism:** The scoring mechanism does not correctly account for the possibility of both players entering cycles of different lengths or values. It assumes that once a player finds the maximum value, they will stay there for the rest of the game, which may not always be optimal.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases where the players' paths diverge and both paths contain the maximum value at different points.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible scenarios. It incorrectly assumes the players will always stay at the maximum value once found, which may not be optimal or even possible in all cases.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
