### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Immediate Check for Maximum Value**:
   - The program checks if the values at `P_B` and `P_S` in the array `a` are both equal to the maximum value in `a`. If so, it immediately concludes a "Draw".
   - If only `P_B` points to the maximum value, it concludes "Bodya" wins.
   - If only `P_S` points to the maximum value, it concludes "Sasha" wins.

3. **Simulation of the Game**:
   - The program initializes scores for both players and flags to indicate if they have reached the maximum value.
   - It simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the scores and positions of both players.
   - If either player reaches the maximum value, they continue to earn that value for the remaining turns.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the scores for both players.
   - It calculates the total possible scores for both players if they continue to earn their current scores for the remaining turns.

5. **Determine the Winner**:
   - The program compares the maximum possible scores for both players and determines the winner based on these scores.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Handling of Large `k`**:
  - The program simulates the game for `k` turns directly. Given that `k` can be as large as \(10^9\), this would lead to a time complexity of \(O(k)\) per test case, which is infeasible given the constraints.
  - The program should detect cycles in the permutation and use cycle lengths to determine the scores for large `k` efficiently.

- **Logic for Maximum Scores**:
  - The logic for calculating the maximum possible scores for the remaining turns is flawed. It assumes that the current score will be repeated for the remaining turns, which may not be the case if the player moves to a different position.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with handling large `k` and the flawed logic for calculating maximum scores, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
