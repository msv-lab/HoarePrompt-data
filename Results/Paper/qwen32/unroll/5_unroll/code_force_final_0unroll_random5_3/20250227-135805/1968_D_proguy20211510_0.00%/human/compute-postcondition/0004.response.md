Output State: **The output state consists of a series of printed results ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each of the t test cases, based on the maximum possible scores that Bodya and Sasha can achieve after k iterations. The values of t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a remain unchanged after the loop execution.**
