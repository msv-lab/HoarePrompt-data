### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by simulating the game for each test case and determining the winner based on the players' scores after `k` turns. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`, and converts them to integers.
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if both players start at positions with the maximum value in the array `a`. If so, it outputs "Draw" because both players will have the same score.
   - If only Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value, it outputs "Bodya" as he will have the highest score.
   - If only Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value, it outputs "Sasha".

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program initializes two lists, `b` and `s`, to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, for each turn.
   - It also initializes two flags, `foundb` and `founds`, to track whether either player has reached the maximum value in the array `a`.
   - For each turn up to `k`, the program updates the scores and positions of both players:
     - If a player reaches a position with the maximum value, the flag for that player is set to True, and the score for that player is updated to the maximum value for the remaining turns.
     - If a player has not reached the maximum value, the score is updated with the value at the current position, and the position is updated according to the permutation `p`.

4. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for both players up to each turn.
   - It then calculates the potential maximum scores for both players by adding the remaining turns multiplied by the maximum value to the cumulative scores up to each turn.

5. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum possible scores of Bodya and Sasha and outputs the winner accordingly.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the initial checks for the maximum value efficiently and simulates the game for each turn up to `k`. The logic for calculating the cumulative scores and the potential maximum scores is accurate.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic related to the handling of the maximum value. The program assumes that once a player reaches the position with the maximum value, they will stay there for the remaining turns. While this is a reasonable assumption for maximizing the score, the problem does not explicitly state that the players can only move to positions with the maximum value once they reach it. Therefore, the program might not correctly handle cases where players can benefit from moving to other positions with high values before reaching the maximum value.

Despite this potential issue, the provided execution summary suggests that the program works correctly for the given test cases. If the problem constraints and examples are sufficient to cover all edge cases, the program can be considered correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
