To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the loop's effect on the variables. The loop iterates over each tuple in `sec_arr`, and for each tuple, it adds the first element of the tuple to `sub_summ`.

Given:
- `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers.
- `sub_summ` is initially 0.

Let's assume `sec_arr` contains tuples like `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)]`. The loop will add `a1`, `a2`, ..., `an` to `sub_summ`.

Thus, after the loop, `sub_summ` will be the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers; `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.**
