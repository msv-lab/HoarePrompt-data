To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and how it modifies the `sub_summ` variable.

The loop iterates over each tuple `val_b` in the `main_ar` list. For each tuple, it checks if the sum of the two integers in the tuple (`val_b[0] + val_b[1]`) is greater than or equal to 0. If this condition is true, it adds the sum of the two integers to the `sub_summ` variable.

Let's assume the initial state of the variables is:
- `main_ar`: A list of tuples, e.g., `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)]`
- `sec_arr`: A list of tuples, e.g., `[(c1, d1), (c2, d2), ..., (cm, dm)]`
- `sub_summ`: The initial sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, i.e., `c1 + c2 + ... + cm`

After the loop executes, `sub_summ` will be updated based on the elements in `main_ar`. Specifically, for each tuple `(a, b)` in `main_ar`, if `a + b >= 0`, `sub_summ` will be incremented by `a + b`.

Thus, the final value of `sub_summ` will be the sum of:
1. The initial `sub_summ` (sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`).
2. The sums of the elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is non-negative.

Let's express this final state:

Output State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the initial `sub_summ` and the sums of the elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is non-negative. The lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.**
