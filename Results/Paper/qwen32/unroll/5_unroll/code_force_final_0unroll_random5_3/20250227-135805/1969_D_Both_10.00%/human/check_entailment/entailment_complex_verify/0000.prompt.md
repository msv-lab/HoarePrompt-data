You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not seem to implement the logic described in the problem statement. The code defines three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), but none of them seem to address the problem requirements fully. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not correctly calculate Alice's profit based on the optimal choices made by Alice and Bob.

Here is a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The code references a function `putin()` which is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This function is expected to read input, but it is not provided, making the code incomplete.

2. **Logic for Calculating Profit**: The function `func_3` attempts to calculate a sum based on the arrays `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, but the logic does not align with the problem requirements. The function does not consider the optimal subset of items Alice should buy to maximize her profit, nor does it account for Bob's strategy of minimizing Alice's profit by selecting `k` items to take for free.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The problem requires Alice to choose a subset of items that maximizes her profit, considering Bob's strategy. The current code does not implement any strategy for Alice to choose items optimally or for Bob to select `k` items to take for free.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as when `k = 0` (Bob takes all items for free if Alice buys less than `k` items) or when `n = 0` (no items to buy or sell).

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and thus it is incorrect.
