The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`input`, `data`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list where `data[0]` is the string representation of `n` and `data[1:]` are the string representations of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`; `index` is 1; `T` is an integer equal to the integer value of `data[0]`.**
