Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description requires a function to generate specific files for HTML files within a specified range of folder names. However, the given program defines a function `func_1` that reads input and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the count of '1's in a string. This is unrelated to the task described in the problem.
