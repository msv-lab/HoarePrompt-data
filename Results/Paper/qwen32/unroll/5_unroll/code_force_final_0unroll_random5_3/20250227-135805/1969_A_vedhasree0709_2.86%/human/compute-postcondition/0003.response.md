Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list that can be swapped to move towards sorting the list in ascending order with a specific pattern. If such a pair is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.**
