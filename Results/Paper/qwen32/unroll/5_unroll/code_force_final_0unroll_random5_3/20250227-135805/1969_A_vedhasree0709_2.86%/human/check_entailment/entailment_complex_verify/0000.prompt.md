You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; p is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all i in [1, n] and p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output will be either `2` or `3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list that can be swapped to move towards sorting the list in ascending order with a specific pattern. If such a pair is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Program Output:**
```
2
```

Explanation of the example:
- Friend 1's best friend is Friend 2.
- Friend 2's best friend is Friend 3.
- Friend 3's best friend is Friend 4.
- Friend 4's best friend is Friend 1.

To have at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends. The program incorrectly outputs 2 for this case, which is not sufficient.

The program's logic is based on a very specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) that does not cover all scenarios. It fails to account for more general cases where the best friend relationships do not follow this specific pattern.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
