Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `buffer` is an empty list.** 

Explanation: The loop processes each test case by reading input values and performing calculations based on those inputs. However, the variable `buffer` is not modified or used within the loop. Therefore, after all iterations, the state of `buffer` remains unchanged as an empty list. The variable `t` also remains unchanged as it is only used to control the number of iterations of the loop.
