The code snippet initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The variable `t`, which is an input integer representing the number of test cases, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `t` still holds its initial value, and `buffer` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `buffer` is an empty list.**
