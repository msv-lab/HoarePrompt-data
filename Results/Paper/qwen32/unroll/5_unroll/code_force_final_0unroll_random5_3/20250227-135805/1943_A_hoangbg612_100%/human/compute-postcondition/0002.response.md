To determine the final state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Outer Loop (`for _ in range(T)`):** This loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases.

2. **Inner Operations:**
   - `S = int(input())`: Read the number of integers in the list for the current test case.
   - `N = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Read the list of integers for the current test case.
   - `N.sort()`: Sort the list of integers.
   - `cur = -1`: Initialize `cur` to -1.
   - `M = {}`: Initialize an empty dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each integer.
   - The first `for` loop iterates over the sorted list `N`:
     - If `num > cur`, it checks if `num > cur + 1`. If true, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it sets `cur = num` and initializes `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num <= cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of values in `M` equals `S`. If true, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It initializes an empty list `cnt` and appends keys from `M` that have a value of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element of `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

Since the code processes each test case independently and only the variable `cur` and the contents of `M` and `cnt` are modified within the loop, the final output state is dependent on the input for each test case.

However, since we are asked to describe the final state after all iterations of the loop, and the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `cnt` are not retained outside the loop, we can only describe the state of `cur` after the last test case is processed.

Thus, the output state after all the iterations is simply the final value of `cur` after the last test case.

Output State: **the final value of `cur` after processing the last test case.**
