Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and removing them.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted. This is not strictly necessary for the problem, but it might help in the logic.

3. **Tracking Elements:**
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - `M` is a dictionary used to count occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments its count in `M`.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `num` in `M`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to `cnt[1]`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Logic for MEX Calculation:** The program's logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. The program is not correctly simulating the game where Alice and Bob take turns, and it's not correctly calculating the MEX based on the elements that Alice adds to `c`.
- **Handling of Counts:** The program's handling of counts and the final check for `cnt` does not align with the optimal strategy for either player.
- **Optimal Strategy:** The program does not account for the optimal strategy where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic and its failure to correctly simulate the game and calculate the MEX, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one would need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns, and calculate the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`. The optimal strategy would involve Alice trying to add elements that maximize the MEX and Bob trying to add elements that minimize it. This would likely involve more complex logic than the provided program.
