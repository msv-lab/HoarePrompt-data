### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly simulates the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)
```

#### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the array `N` helps in easily finding the smallest missing number (MEX).

3. **Dictionary `M`**:
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in `N`.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` to the smallest number not yet encountered in `M`.
   - If a number greater than `cur + 1` is found, it breaks the loop and sets `cur` to `cur + 1`. This is because the smallest missing number would be `cur + 1`.

5. **Adjustments Based on Counts**:
   - The program checks if the total count of all elements in `M` equals `S`. If yes, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then collects all keys in `M` that have a count of 1 into the list `cnt`.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second smallest key in `cnt`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for adjusting `cur` based on the counts in `M` and the list `cnt` seems incorrect. The program is not correctly simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
- The program does not correctly account for the optimal strategies of both players to maximize or minimize the MEX.

#### Correctness:
The program does not correctly determine the optimal MEX by simulating the moves of Alice and Bob. The logic for determining the MEX is flawed, and the adjustments based on counts in `M` and `cnt` do not align with the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the program is **incorrect**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
