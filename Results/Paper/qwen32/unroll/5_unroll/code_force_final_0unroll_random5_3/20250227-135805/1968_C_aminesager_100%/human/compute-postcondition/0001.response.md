To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head. The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value.

Given the state before the loop: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since `t` is already defined to be in the range 1 to 10^4, it is guaranteed to be a non-zero value. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute at least once. 

No adjustments are needed to the state of `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
