### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Sorting Arrays**:
    - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
    - The program sorts the array `c` in descending order.
    - This ensures that we can maximize the absolute difference by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c` and vice versa.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
    - The program first checks if both arrays `a` and `c` contain only one unique element and if they are the same. If so, it prints `0` because the maximum difference `D` would be `0`.
    - It also handles the case where `n` (length of `a`) is `1` separately. In this case, the maximum difference `D` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `a[0]` and the maximum and minimum values in `c`.

3. **Greedy Approach**:
    - The program uses a greedy approach to maximize the total difference `D`. It iterates through the elements of `a` and `c` and at each step, it compares the potential differences from the smallest and largest ends.
    - It chooses the larger of the two differences and adds it to the total difference `D`.
    - The indices `i` and `j` are used to track the positions in `a` and `c` respectively.

4. **Iterative Calculation**:
    - The program iterates through the length of `a` and calculates the maximum possible difference for each element by comparing the differences from the smallest and largest ends of `a` and `c`.
    - It updates the total difference `D` accordingly.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` by sorting the arrays appropriately and using a greedy approach. It handles edge cases such as when all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and when `n` is `1`. The program also ensures that the sum of differences is maximized by always choosing the larger difference at each step.

Thus, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
