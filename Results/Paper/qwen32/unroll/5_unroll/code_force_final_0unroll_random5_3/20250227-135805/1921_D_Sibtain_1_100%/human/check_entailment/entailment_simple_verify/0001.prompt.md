You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) by choosing \( n \) integers from the array \( b_i \) (renamed as \( c_i \) in the program) and arranging them to form the array \( c_i \).

### Strategy:
1. **Sorting**: To maximize the difference, one effective strategy is to pair the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( c \) and vice versa.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by sorting the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( c \) in descending order. It then iteratively selects the largest possible difference between elements of \( a \) and \( c \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Special Case Handling**: The program first checks if all elements in both arrays \( a \) and \( c \) are identical. If so, the maximum difference \( D \) is 0.
2. **Sorting**: The arrays \( a \) and \( c \) are sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively.
3. **Greedy Selection**: The program uses two pointers \( i \) and \( j \) to iterate through the arrays \( a \) and \( c \). For each element in \( a \), it calculates the potential differences with the current smallest and largest elements in \( c \) and selects the maximum difference.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the length of \( a \) is 1 separately to avoid unnecessary iterations.

### Correctness:
The program's approach is correct based on the problem's requirements. By sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( c \) in descending order, and then greedily selecting the maximum possible differences, the program ensures that the total difference \( D \) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \) and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
