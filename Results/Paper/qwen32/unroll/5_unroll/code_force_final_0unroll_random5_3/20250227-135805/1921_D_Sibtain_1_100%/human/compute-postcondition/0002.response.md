Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` and two lists of integers `a` and `b` where `a` contains `n` integers and `b` contains `m` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided lists `a` and `b`.**
