### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible to redistribute water among containers such that each container has the same amount of water. The program does this by checking if, at any point during the redistribution process, the cumulative difference between the current container's water amount and the mean water amount (which is the target amount for each container) becomes negative. If it does, the program returns "NO", indicating that it is not possible to redistribute the water as required. Otherwise, it returns "YES".

However, there is a critical issue with the program. The variable `nums` in the function `func_1` is expected to be a single list of integers representing the water amounts in a single test case, not a list of lists. The annotated state description for `nums` before the function call is incorrect, as it states that `nums` is a list of lists. This discrepancy indicates that the function is not being called correctly with the intended input structure.

The correct behavior of the program should be as follows:
1. For each test case, `nums` should be a list of integers representing the water amounts in that test case.
2. The function `func_1` should compute the mean water amount that each container should have.
3. It should then iterate through the list `nums`, maintaining a cumulative difference (`curr`) between the current container's water amount and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it should return "NO".
4. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it should return "YES".

Given the provided example and the correct interpretation of the function's input, the program logic itself is correct. However, the annotated state before the function call indicates a misunderstanding of the input structure, which is a significant issue.

### Correctness: **False**

The reason for marking it as **False** is the incorrect assumption about the structure of the input to the function `func_1`. The function expects a single list of integers for each test case, not a list of lists. This discrepancy needs to be addressed for the program to work correctly as intended.
