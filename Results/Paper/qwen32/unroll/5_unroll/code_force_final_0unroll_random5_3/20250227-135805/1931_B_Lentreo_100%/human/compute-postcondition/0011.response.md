Functionality: **The function `func_1` evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a number of containers and their respective water amounts. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in each test case such that all containers have the same amount of water. If it is possible, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
