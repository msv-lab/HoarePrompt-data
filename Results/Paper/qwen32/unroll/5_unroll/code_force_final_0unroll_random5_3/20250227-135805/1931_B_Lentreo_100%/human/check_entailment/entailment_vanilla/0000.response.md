Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any container i to any container j where i < j. The key insight is that for it to be possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean amount of water should never be negative as we traverse the containers from left to right.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in the containers `nums`.
3. It then calls `func_1(nums)` to determine if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers.
4. Inside `func_1(nums)`:
   - It calculates the total amount of water across all containers.
   - It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n` (though this check is redundant since the problem guarantees this).
   - It calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean.
   - It iterates through each container, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance out the deficit in the current container, so it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

The logic is sound because if `curr` never becomes negative, it means that at any point in the traversal, the water in the containers to the left can be redistributed to meet the mean requirement for the containers seen so far, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the entire list to be equalized.

Correctness: **True**
