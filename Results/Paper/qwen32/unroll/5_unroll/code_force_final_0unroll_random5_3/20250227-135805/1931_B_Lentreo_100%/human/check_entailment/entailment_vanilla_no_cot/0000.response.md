Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Calculate the Mean**: The program first calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have if the water were evenly distributed. This is done by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers.

2. **Check Balance**: The program then iterates through the containers and keeps a running balance of the water. It adds the difference between the current container's water and the mean to this balance. If at any point this balance becomes negative, it means that the current container does not have enough water to "balance out" the previous containers, and thus, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the given operation.

3. **Return Result**: If the balance never goes negative, it means that it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers end up with the mean amount of water.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement, and it correctly outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the feasibility of the redistribution.
