### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1(nums)`:**
   - It calculates the total amount of water across all containers in the current test case.
   - It checks if the total amount is divisible by `n` (which is guaranteed by the problem statement, so this check is redundant but harmless).
   - It calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have if the water is evenly distributed.
   - It then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running total of the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean. This running total (`curr`) represents the excess or deficit of water encountered so far.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than needed to balance the previous containers, and there is no way to pour water from previous containers to this one to balance it out. Therefore, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to balance the water.

The logic behind the program is sound. The key insight is that if you can pour water from left to right to balance the containers without ever needing to pour water into a container that already has less than its fair share, then it is possible to balance all containers.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described above. Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program will correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

**Correctness: True**
