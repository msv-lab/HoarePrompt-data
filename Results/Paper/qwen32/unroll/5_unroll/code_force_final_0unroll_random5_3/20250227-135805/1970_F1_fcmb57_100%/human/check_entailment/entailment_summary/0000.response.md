Reasoning:  
The provided Python program has a significant issue due to incorrect function parameter handling in `func_1`. The function `func_1` is supposed to take a tuple `a` and a tuple `b`, and unpack them to calculate the new position. However, the execution summary indicates that `func_1` is being called with an integer and a list, which will result in an unpacking error. This error would prevent the program from running correctly and processing the player movements as intended.

Given the error in the function `func_1`, the program cannot correctly simulate the movements of players and the scoring mechanism, leading to incorrect behavior.

Correctness: **False**
