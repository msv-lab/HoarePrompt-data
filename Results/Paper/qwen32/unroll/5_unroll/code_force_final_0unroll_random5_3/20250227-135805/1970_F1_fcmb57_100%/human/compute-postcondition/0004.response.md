Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the number of lines in the field (where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd), and `b`, a list of strings where each string represents a row in the field. The function is supposed to perform some operations based on the input but incorrectly attempts to unpack the list `b` into `dx` and `dy`, leading to an error.**
