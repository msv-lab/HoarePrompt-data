In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `iterable`, and it is controlled by the `range(loop)` function. The loop will execute if `loop` is greater than 0. The variables `t`, `n`, and the constraints described by pairs `(a, x)` do not directly influence whether the loop will execute; they are part of the program state but not part of the loop head.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `loop` is greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the constraints) should remain as they are described in the problem statement, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, all pairs (a, x) are distinct, and `loop` is greater than 0**
