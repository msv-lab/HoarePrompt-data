Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to verify if the given program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (all '0's followed by all '1's) using the minimum total cost. The cost of cyclically shifting a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0. This variable counts the number of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iterating through the string**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means we have encountered a '0' after some '1's. This indicates that we need to move these '1's before the '0' to sort the string. The cost to move these '1's is the length of the substring containing these '1's plus the '0', which is `one + 1`. This cost is added to the total `cost`.

3. **Returning the cost**:
   - The function returns the total `cost` after processing the entire string.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary states that the function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the cost, which is calculated as the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string followed by a '0'.

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's evaluate the correctness of the solution based on the function summary and problem requirements:

1. **Handling Consecutive '1's Followed by '0's**:
   - When a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, the cost is correctly calculated as `one + 1`. This is because the substring of '1's needs to be cyclically shifted to be placed before the '0'.
   - For example, in the string "11000", the first '0' after two '1's contributes a cost of `2 + 1 = 3`. The next two '0's after the first '0' do not contribute additional costs because there are no more '1's before them.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Strings Starting with '0's**: If the string starts with '0's, there are no '1's before the first '0', so the cost remains 0.
   - **Strings with Only '0's or Only '1's**: If the string is already sorted (all '0's or all '1's), the cost is 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - **Strings Ending with '1's**: If the string ends with '1's, there are no '0's after the last '1', so the cost remains 0.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The solution iterates through the string once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string using the described operations. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the cost. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation
Reasoning: The solution correctly calculates the minimum cost by identifying the points where a '0' follows one or more '1's and adding the appropriate cost for each such occurrence. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the cost.
Final: **True**
