### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

The provided function `func_1` calculates the cost in a different manner. It sums up `(number of consecutive '1's + 1)` for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string. This approach does not directly correspond to the cyclic shift cost as described in the problem.

To understand if this is correct, let's analyze the function and the problem statement:

1. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function iterates through the string and counts consecutive '1's.
   - When it encounters a '0' after some '1's, it adds the count of '1's plus one to the cost.
   - This approach is not about performing cyclic shifts but rather counting segments of '1's and adding a fixed cost for each segment.

2. **Problem Analysis:**
   - The problem involves performing cyclic shifts on substrings to sort the string.
   - The cost is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The optimal solution involves strategically choosing substrings to minimize the total cost.

Given the example provided in the problem, let's see if the function `func_1` produces the correct cost:

- For the input `10`, the function calculates the cost as `2` (one segment of '1's with length 1, so `1 + 1 = 2`).
- For the input `0000`, the function calculates the cost as `0` (no '1's, so cost is `0`).
- For the input `11000`, the function calculates the cost as `9` (one segment of '1's with length 2, so `2 + 1 = 3`, but it seems incorrect as the example states the cost is `9`).
- For the input `101011`, the function calculates the cost as `5` (two segments of '1's with lengths 1 and 2, so `1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5`).
- For the input `01101001`, the function calculates the cost as `11` (three segments of '1's with lengths 1, 1, and 2, so `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7`, but it seems incorrect as the example states the cost is `11`).

The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost required to sort the string using cyclic shifts as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
