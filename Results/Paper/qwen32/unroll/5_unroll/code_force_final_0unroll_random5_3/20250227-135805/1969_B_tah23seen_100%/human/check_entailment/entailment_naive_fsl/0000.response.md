Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operation. Let's analyze the program and identify a case where it fails.

The program calculates the cost by iterating through the string and adding the number of '1's encountered plus one to the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string.

### Example where the program fails:
Consider the input string `110100`. According to the program, the cost would be calculated as follows:
- The first character is '1', so `one` becomes 1.
- The second character is '1', so `one` becomes 2.
- The third character is '0', so the cost is incremented by `one + 1 = 3`.
- The fourth character is '1', so `one` becomes 3.
- The fifth character is '0', so the cost is incremented by `one + 1 = 4`.
- The sixth character is '0', so the cost remains unchanged as there are no more '1's after this point.

Hence, the total cost calculated by the program is `3 + 4 = 7`.

However, the optimal way to sort the string `110100` is:
1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]`: `110100` → `011100` (cost = 3)
2. Choose the substring `[2, 4]`: `011100` → `001110` (cost = 3)
3. Choose the substring `[3, 5]`: `001110` → `000111` (cost = 3)

The total cost is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.

But there is an even better way:
1. Choose the substring `[1, 4]`: `110100` → `011011` (cost = 4)
2. Choose the substring `[2, 5]`: `011011` → `001111` (cost = 4)

The total cost is `4 + 4 = 8`.

The program does not account for these optimal operations and thus calculates an incorrect cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
