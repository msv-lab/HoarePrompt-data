Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts on any substring, and the goal is to minimize the total cost, where the cost of a shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

### Program Analysis
The provided program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**: `cost` is initialized to 0, and `one` is initialized to 0. `cost` will store the total cost, and `one` will count the number of '1's encountered so far in the string.

2. **Iterating through the string**: The function iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means there are '1's to the left of this '0'. The cost to move these '1's to the right of this '0' is `one + 1` (since the cost is the length of the substring, which includes the current '0' and all the '1's to its left), and this value is added to `cost`.

3. **Return the cost**: After processing the entire string, the function returns the total `cost`.

### Correctness Check
The approach taken by the program is based on the idea that every time a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, the cost to move those '1's to the right of the '0' is `one + 1`. However, this approach does not consider all possible cyclic shifts and may not always yield the minimum cost.

Let's consider the example from the problem statement:

- For the string `11000`, the program calculates the cost as follows:
  - First '1': `one = 1`
  - Second '1': `one = 2`
  - First '0': `cost = 2 + 1 = 3` (since `one = 2`)
  - Second '0': `cost = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6` (since `one = 2`)
  - Third '0': `cost = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9` (since `one = 2`)
  - The total cost is 9.

However, an optimal strategy could be:
1. Choose substring [1, 3]: `11000 -> 01100` (cost = 3)
2. Choose substring [2, 4]: `01100 -> 00110` (cost = 3)
3. Choose substring [3, 5]: `00110 -> 00011` (cost = 3)

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which matches the program's output for this example. However, this does not prove the program is correct for all cases.

### Conclusion
The provided program might work for some cases but does not guarantee the minimum cost for all possible binary strings. Therefore, the program is not universally correct.
