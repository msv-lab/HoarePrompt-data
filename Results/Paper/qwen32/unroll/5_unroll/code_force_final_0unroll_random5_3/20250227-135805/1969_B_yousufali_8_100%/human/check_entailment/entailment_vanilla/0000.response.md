Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using a specific operation. The operation allows us to cyclically shift any substring `s[l] s[l+1] ... s[r]` for a cost of `r - l + 1`. We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function processes a single binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input string.

Let's focus on `func_1()` to understand how it calculates the minimum cost.

#### Key Logic in `func_1()`
- We iterate through the string `s` and maintain a counter `n` that counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- Whenever we encounter a '0', and `n` (the count of '1's seen so far) is not zero, we add `n + 1` to the answer `ans`.
  - The logic behind `n + 1` is that to move this '0' past all the '1's encountered so far, we need to perform a cyclic shift on a substring that includes this '0' and all the preceding '1's. The cost of this operation is `n + 1`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the solution with the example provided in the problem statement.

#### Example Walkthrough
1. **Input:** `10`
   - `n = 1` (first character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (second character is '0', and `n` is not zero)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - No '1's are encountered, so `ans` remains `0`.
   - Output: `0` (correct)

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - `n = 2` (first two characters are '1's)
   - `ans = 2 + 1 = 3` (third character is '0')
   - `ans = 3 + 2 = 5` (fourth character is '0')
   - `ans = 5 + 3 = 8` (fifth character is '0')
   - Output: `8` (incorrect, expected: `9`)

   The provided solution seems to have an off-by-one error in the calculation for this case.

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - `n = 1` (first character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (second character is '0')
   - `n = 2` (third character is '1')
   - `ans = 2 + 2 = 4` (fourth character is '0')
   - `n = 3` (fifth character is '1')
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7` (sixth character is '1')
   - Output: `7` (incorrect, expected: `5`)

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - `n = 1` (second character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (third character is '1')
   - `n = 2` (fourth character is '0')
   - `ans = 2 + 2 = 4` (fifth character is '1')
   - `n = 3` (sixth character is '0')
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7` (seventh character is '0')
   - `ans = 7 + 4 = 11` (eighth character is '1')
   - Output: `11` (correct)

### Conclusion
The solution provided is incorrect. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed, as demonstrated by the incorrect outputs for the test cases `11000` and `101011`.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The provided solution has incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
Correctness: **False**
