To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and understand what it does. The loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

Here, `t` is an input integer, and `func_1()` is a function that gets called `t` times. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't actually use in the loop body.

Since the loop does not modify the variable `t` or any other variable outside the loop, and the effect of `func_1()` is not specified (other than it being called `t` times), the only change in state is the execution of `func_1()` `t` times.

However, since we are asked to describe the output state in terms of the variables in the loop head and body, and no changes are made to `t` or `_` within the loop, the output state of these variables remains the same as the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer.**
