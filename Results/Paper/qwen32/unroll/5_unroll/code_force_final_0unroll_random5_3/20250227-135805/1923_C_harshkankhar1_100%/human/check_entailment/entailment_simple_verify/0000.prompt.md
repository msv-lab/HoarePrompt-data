You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not properly handle all edge cases and conditions required for a subarray to be considered "good."

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Condition 2: a_i ≠ b_i for every index i from 1 to m**
   - The program sets `b[i]` to either 1 or 2 based on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not. This does not guarantee that `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i` in the subarray. For example, if `a[i]` is 1, `b[i]` is set to 2, which is fine. However, if `a[i]` is 2, `b[i]` is set to 1, which could lead to a situation where `a_i = b_i` if the value of `a[i]` is 1.

2. **Condition 3: b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m**
   - The program ensures `b[i]` is either 1 or 2, which satisfies this condition. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is "good."

3. **Condition 1: ∑a_i = ∑b_i for every index i from 1 to m**
   - The program checks if the sum of the subarray `a` is less than the sum of the subarray `b`. If it is, it prints "NO." However, this check is not comprehensive. The program does not ensure that there exists a valid `b` array that meets all conditions for the subarray to be "good."

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
```
The program will set `b` as `[0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (since `a[1] = 1`, `a[2] = 2`, `a[3] = 3`, `a[4] = 4`, `a[5] = 5`). The accumulated sums for `a` and `b` will be:
- `a` (accumulated): `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15]`
- `b` (accumulated): `[0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

For the query `1 5`, the program checks if `a[5] - a[0] < b[5] - b[0]`, which translates to `15 < 6`, which is false. However, the program prints "NO" because of the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`. This is incorrect because the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` can indeed have a corresponding `b` array `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6]` that satisfies all conditions:
- `a` sum: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`
- `b` sum: `2 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 15`
- `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`
- `b_i > 0` for every index `i`

Thus, the program incorrectly determines that the subarray is not "good" in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correctness is **False**.
