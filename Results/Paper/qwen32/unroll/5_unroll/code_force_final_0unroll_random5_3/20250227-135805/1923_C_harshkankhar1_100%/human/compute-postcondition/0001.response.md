The code snippet provided reads a list of integers from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to a list `a` with an additional `0` at the beginning of the list. The values of `n` and `q` are already assigned from the input, and they describe the number of integers in the list `c` and the number of queries, respectively.

The output state will reflect the new list `a` with the `0` prepended to the list of integers read from the input. The values of `n`, `q`, and the list `c` remain unchanged and are still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `q` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is `0` and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input.**
