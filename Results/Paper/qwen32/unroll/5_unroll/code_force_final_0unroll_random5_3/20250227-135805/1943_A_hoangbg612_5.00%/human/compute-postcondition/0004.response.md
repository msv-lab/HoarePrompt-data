Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each element is between 0 and `n-1`. It then computes and prints a value based on the sorted list and the given integer `n`. The printed value represents the smallest integer `cur` such that the number of elements in the list less than or equal to `cur` is at least `cur + 1`.**
