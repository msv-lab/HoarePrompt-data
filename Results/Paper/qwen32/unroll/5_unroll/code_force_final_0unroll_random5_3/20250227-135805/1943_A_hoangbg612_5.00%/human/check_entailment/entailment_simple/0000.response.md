### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. 

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program first reads the number of test cases `T`, then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted. Sorting helps in easily finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array by iterating through the sorted array.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX (`cur`)**: The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`. This variable will keep track of the current MEX as the elements are processed. The dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number.

4. **Processing Elements**: The program iterates through the sorted array `N`:
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If it is, then `cur + 1` is the smallest missing number, and the loop breaks.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and increments the count of `num` in the dictionary `M`.
   
5. **Final MEX Calculation**: After the loop, if the sum of counts of all numbers in `M` equals `S`, it means all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present, so `cur` is incremented by `1`. This handles the case where all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present in `N`.

6. **Adjusting `cur`**: The program then checks if any number `i` less than `cur` has a count in `M` that is less than or equal to `i`. If such a number is found, `cur` is set to `i` and the loop breaks. This step ensures that `cur` is the smallest number not present in `M` with the correct count.

7. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

### Analysis:

The logic seems to be correct in terms of finding the MEX based on the given rules and optimal play from Alice and Bob. The sorting step ensures that we can efficiently find the smallest missing number. The dictionary `M` helps in counting occurrences, and the final adjustments ensure that the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` is found correctly.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

**Correctness: True**
