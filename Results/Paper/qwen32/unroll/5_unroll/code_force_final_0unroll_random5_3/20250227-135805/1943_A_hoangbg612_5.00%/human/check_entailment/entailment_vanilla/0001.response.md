Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine the final score of the game which is the MEX of array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The key points are:
- Alice maximizes the score.
- Bob minimizes the score.
- The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program broken down:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting and Processing:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This step is crucial because it allows the program to easily track the smallest missing number.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in `N`.
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` to keep track of the current MEX.

3. **Determining MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop, indicating that `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and adds it to the dictionary `M`.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
   - After the loop, if all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present in `M` and their counts are at least equal to their values, `cur + 1` is the MEX.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the size of the array). If yes, it increments `cur` by `1` to account for the MEX.
   - It then iterates through the range from `0` to `cur` to find the smallest `i` where `M[i] <= i`. If such an `i` is found, it updates `cur` to `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

### Correctness Analysis
The program's logic is mostly correct, but there are some issues:
- The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1: cur += 1; break` is not always correct. It should ensure that all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present before determining the MEX.
- The final adjustment loop is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
