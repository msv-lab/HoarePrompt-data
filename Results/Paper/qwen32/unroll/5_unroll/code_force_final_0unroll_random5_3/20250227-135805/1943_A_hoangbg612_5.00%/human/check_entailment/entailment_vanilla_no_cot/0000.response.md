To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze its logic in the context of the problem description. Let's break down the program and see if it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and then the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted. This step is crucial for the subsequent logic, as it allows the program to efficiently determine the smallest missing non-negative integer.

3. **Tracking Elements**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in `a`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the current smallest non-negative integer `cur` that is not yet in `c`.

4. **Updating Current MEX**:
   - If a number in `N` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means `cur + 1` is missing, and `cur` is updated to `cur + 1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the number in `N` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
   - If the number in `N` is greater than `cur` but not `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to the number.

5. **Checking Completion**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the total count of elements in `M` equals `n`. If so, it means all numbers up to `cur` are present, and `cur` is incremented by 1.

6. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates from `0` to `cur` to find the first index `i` where the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. This index `i` is the MEX of the array `c`.

### Issues in the Program

The program seems to have a logical flaw in the way it calculates the MEX. Specifically, the approach of updating `cur` based on the sorted array and checking the counts in `M` does not necessarily reflect the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

### Correct Approach

1. **Counting Elements**:
   - Count the occurrences of each number in `a` using a dictionary or an array.
   
2. **Simulating the Game**:
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice picking the smallest available number that does not yet appear in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob will pick any number to minimize the MEX.

3. **Calculating MEX**:
   - Since Alice and Bob alternate turns, the final MEX can be determined by the pattern of their moves. If the number of elements is even, the final MEX will be the smallest number not in `a` after all moves. If the number of elements is odd, Alice's last move will determine the final MEX.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob and does not accurately calculate the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
