Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong based on the given criteria. Here's a breakdown of the checks performed by the program:

1. **Sorting of Letters and Digits:** The program separates the letters and digits into two lists and checks if each list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns "NO".

2. **Digit Following a Letter:** The program iterates through the password and checks if there is any digit that comes immediately after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns "NO".

3. **Output:** If the password passes both checks, the program returns "YES".

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly evaluates the password based on the described rules. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
