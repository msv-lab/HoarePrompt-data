You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password, `n`, and then the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes `n` and the password as input.
   - Inside the function, it separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It iterates through the password to check if any letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions are violated, it returns 'YES'.

### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `12ac`
   - Letters: `['a', 'c']`, Digits: `['1', '2']`
   - Both lists are sorted, and no digit follows a letter.
   - **Output:** `YES` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `123wa`
   - Letters: `['a', 'w']`, Digits: `['1', '2', '3']`
   - Letters are not in non-decreasing order.
   - **Output:** `NO` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `9`, `allllmost`
   - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']`, Digits: `[]`
   - Letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - **Output:** `YES` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `ac123`
   - Letters: `['a', 'c']`, Digits: `['1', '2', '3']`
   - A digit follows a letter.
   - **Output:** `NO` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `6`, `011679`
   - Letters: `[]`, Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']`
   - Digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - **Output:** `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions required for a password to be considered strong. It correctly identifies whether a password is strong or not based on the given criteria.

**Correctness:** **True**
