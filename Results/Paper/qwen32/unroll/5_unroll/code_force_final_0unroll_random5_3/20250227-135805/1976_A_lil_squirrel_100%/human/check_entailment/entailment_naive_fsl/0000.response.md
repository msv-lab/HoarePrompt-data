Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly identify passwords where the digits come after a letter. The current implementation only checks if the first letter is followed by a digit, but it should ensure that no digit appears after any letter in the password.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
abc12
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

In this case, the password "abc12" contains digits after letters, which violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. The program should return "NO" for this input, but it returns "YES".

To fix this, the program should ensure that once a digit is encountered, no letters should follow it. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    seen_digit = False
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            seen_digit = True
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            if seen_digit:
                return 'NO'
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected version introduces a `seen_digit` flag to ensure that no letters appear after any digit in the password.
