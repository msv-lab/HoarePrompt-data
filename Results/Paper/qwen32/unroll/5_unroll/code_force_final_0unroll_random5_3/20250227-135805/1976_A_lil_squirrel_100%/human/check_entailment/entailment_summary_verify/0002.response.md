### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified criteria. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the password by separating it into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure that no letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all these conditions are satisfied, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Verification Against Test Cases:**
   - The original assessment correctly verifies the program against the provided examples, demonstrating that the program behaves as expected for each test case.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`, confirming that it checks for the required conditions and returns the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified criteria. It correctly handles the separation of letters and digits, checks for sorting, and ensures that no letter is followed by a digit. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final:** **True**
