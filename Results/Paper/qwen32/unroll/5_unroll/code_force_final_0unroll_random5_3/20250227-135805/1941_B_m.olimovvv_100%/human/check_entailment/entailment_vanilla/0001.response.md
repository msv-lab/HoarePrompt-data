Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n - 1\)) and then:
- Decrease \(a_{i-1}\) by 1.
- Decrease \(a_i\) by 2.
- Decrease \(a_{i+1}\) by 1.

The key aspect is to see if we can reduce the array to all zeros using this operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case, reads the array, and then attempts to reduce the array to zeros by iterating through the array and applying the operation. However, the implementation is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The program incorrectly applies the operation by setting `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`. This logic does not match the problem's operation, which requires decreasing `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1. Instead, the program is essentially trying to force `b[i]` to zero by subtracting it from `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` and then setting `b[i]` to zero.

2. **Negative Values Check**: The program checks for negative values in the array, but it does so incorrectly. If `b[i]` is negative, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop. However, negative values can occur due to the incorrect logic of the operation, not necessarily because it's impossible to make the array zero.

3. **Final Check**: After processing the array, the program checks if the last two elements (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are zero. If not, it prints "NO". This is also incorrect because the logic to reduce the array is flawed, and it may incorrectly conclude that it's impossible even when it's possible.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
