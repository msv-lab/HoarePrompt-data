### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The program iterates through the array `a` from the end to the beginning, calculating the corresponding values of `p` using the formula \( p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{i-1}) - a_i \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n` (the length of the permutation). This is because initially, the smallest non-negative integer not in the permutation is `0`, and `mex` is the upper bound for the smallest missing number.
   - `p` is initialized as a list of `-1` of length `n`.

2. **Iterating from the end to the beginning**:
   - For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`, the program calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - The `mex` is then updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing `p` for a test case, the program prints the permutation.

### Correctness Verification:

The program's approach is correct because it effectively reconstructs the permutation `p` in reverse order by leveraging the relationship between `a` and `p`. The key point is that `mex` is updated to reflect the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`, ensuring that the constructed permutation is valid.

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]`

In all test cases, the program correctly reconstructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
