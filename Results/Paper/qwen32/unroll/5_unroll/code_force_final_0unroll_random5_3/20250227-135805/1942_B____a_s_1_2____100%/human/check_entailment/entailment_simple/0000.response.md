### Reasoning:
The program is designed to construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` such that for each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The algorithm starts by initializing `p` with `-1` and `mex` with `n`. It then iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning, setting `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` to indicate that no elements have been assigned yet. `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the smallest possible MEX value for an empty set.

2. **Iterating Backwards**: The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning. For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. This step ensures that `a[i]` is the difference between the MEX of the prefix `p[1]` to `p[i]` and `p[i]` itself.

3. **Updating MEX**: After setting `p[i]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This step ensures that `mex` remains the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the constructed permutation `p` is printed.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the first test case from the example:

- **Input**: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
- **Process**:
  - `i = 4`: `mex = 5`, `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
  - `i = 3`: `mex = 3`, `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
  - `i = 2`: `mex = 2`, `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
  - `i = 1`: `mex = 2`, `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - `i = 0`: `mex = 1`, `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
- **Output**: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

This output matches the given example, confirming that the program works correctly for this case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
