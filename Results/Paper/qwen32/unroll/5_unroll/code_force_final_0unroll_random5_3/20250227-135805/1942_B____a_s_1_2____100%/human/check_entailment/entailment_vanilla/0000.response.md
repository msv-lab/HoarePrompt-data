Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
Farmer John gives Bessie an array `a` of length `n`, and she needs to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each `i`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` refers to the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating backwards through the array `a` and constructing the permutation `p` as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `a` are read.
   - An array `p` of length `n` is initialized with `-1`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Backward Construction:**
   - The program iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
Let's consider the logic behind the backward construction:

- **Backward Iteration:** The program iterates from the last element to the first. This is a reasonable approach because it allows us to determine the smallest possible `p[i]` values first, which can then be used to ensure that the `MEX` condition holds for previous elements.
  
- **MEX Calculation:** The `mex` variable is used to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`. By initializing `mex` to `n` (the maximum possible value), and then decrementing it as we assign values to `p`, we ensure that we always use the smallest available integer.
  
- **Updating `mex`:** After assigning `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest unused integer.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:

- **MEX Update:** The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` is incorrect. The `mex` should be updated to the smallest integer greater than the current `p[i]` that has not been used yet, not the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the `mex` after assigning `p[i]`, we need to:
- Use a set to keep track of the numbers that have been used in `p`.
- After assigning `p[i]`, update the set and find the next smallest integer not in the set.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly update the `mex` after assigning `p[i]`, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
