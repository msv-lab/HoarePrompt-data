Output State: **For each of the t test cases, a permutation p of length n is printed where each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i] starting from i = n-1 to i = 0, and mex is updated to be the minimum of its current value and p[i]. The value of t, n, and the list a remain unchanged across different test cases.**
