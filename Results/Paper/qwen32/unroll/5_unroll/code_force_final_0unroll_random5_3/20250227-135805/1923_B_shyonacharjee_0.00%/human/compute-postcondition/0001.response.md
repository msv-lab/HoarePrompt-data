The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. However, the loop will execute based on the range, which is determined by the variable `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`) are defined inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, we only need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop runs.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 3 · 10^4**
