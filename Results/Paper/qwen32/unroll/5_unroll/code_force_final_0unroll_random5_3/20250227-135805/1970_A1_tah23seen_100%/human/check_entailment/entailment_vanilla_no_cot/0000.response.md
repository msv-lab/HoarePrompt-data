Correctness: **False**

The program provided contains a logical error in the way it processes and sorts the prefix balances. The issue lies in the way the dictionary `d` is being used and how the sorting is performed.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The dictionary `d` is used to store prefix balances, but it includes the position as the key and the balance as the value. The position is 1-indexed in the problem description, but the code treats it as 0-indexed, which is fine, but the logic for sorting and creating the final string needs to be adjusted accordingly.

2. The dictionary `d` is sorted using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`. This is correct in terms of sorting by balance and then by position in descending order, but the dictionary `d` includes the position as the key and the balance as the value. When you sort `d.items()`, you get tuples of the form `(position, balance)`. However, when you construct the final string, you are using `s[i]` where `i` is the position from the sorted tuple, but you need to use `i-1` because the string `s` is 0-indexed.

To fix the program, you should adjust the indexing when constructing the final string `ans`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i-1]  # Adjusted index to be 0-based
    return ans
```

With this change, the program should correctly compute the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.
