Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
   - However, for each test case, it reads two lines: `a` and `b`. According to the problem description, there should be only one line of input for the integers in each test case.

2. **Processing Input:**
   - The program attempts to split and convert the input string `b` into a list of integers. This is correct, but it should be applied to a single line of input, not two separate lines.

3. **Sorting and Summing:**
   - The program sorts the list of integers and sums every second element starting from the first. This is the correct approach to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available number.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the final scores correctly, but the input reading process is flawed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().split()
        list2 = [int(x) for x in a]
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, len(list2), 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly and processes it as described in the problem statement.
