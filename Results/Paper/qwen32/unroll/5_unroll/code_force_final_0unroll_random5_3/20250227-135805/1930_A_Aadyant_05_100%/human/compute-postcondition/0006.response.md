Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on a whiteboard, followed by 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), the number of test cases. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each one.**
