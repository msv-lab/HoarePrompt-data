The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` with characters '0' and '1'. It calculates and prints the optimal boundary position for each test case such that the number of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side are as balanced as possible.
