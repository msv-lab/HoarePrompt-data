Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5), representing the number of houses. The next line contains a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`.**

In natural language: The initial state regarding the test cases and the string `a` remains unchanged. The variable `t` is now assigned the integer value from the first input, which represents the number of test cases.
