Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the optimal position for the road. The main issue is in the handling of the initial counts and the movement of the road position. The program initializes the counts for the left and right sides only up to the middle of the list, which can lead to incorrect results if the optimal position is not around the middle. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the road should be placed before the first house (position 0) or after the last house (position n).

Here are some specific issues in the code:

1. **Initial Counts**: The initial counts for `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` are only calculated up to the middle of the list. This means that if the optimal position is not around the middle, the counts for the right side will be incorrect.

2. **Movement Logic**: The logic for moving the road position to the left and right is not correctly implemented. The program should check all possible positions and maintain correct counts for both sides as the road position changes.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road should be placed before the first house or after the last house.

To fix the program, we need to correctly initialize the counts and then iterate through all possible positions for the road, updating the counts as we go. We should also ensure that we correctly handle the edge cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        mid = n // 2
        leftZero = 0
        leftOne = 0
        rightZero = s.count('0')
        rightOne = s.count('1')
        best_pos = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i > 0:
                if s[i - 1] == '0':
                    leftZero += 1
                    rightZero -= 1
                else:
                    leftOne += 1
                    rightOne -= 1
            
            if leftZero >= (i + 1) // 2 and rightOne >= (n - i) // 2:
                diff = abs((n + 1) // 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_pos):
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_pos = i
        
        print(best_pos)

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the counts for the right side and then iterates through all possible positions for the road, updating the counts and checking the conditions for each position. It also correctly handles the edge cases where the road should be placed before the first house or after the last house.
