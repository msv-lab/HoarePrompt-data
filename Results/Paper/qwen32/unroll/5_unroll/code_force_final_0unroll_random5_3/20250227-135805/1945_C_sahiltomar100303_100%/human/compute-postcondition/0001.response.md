In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer input by the user. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer for the loop to execute. The other variables `n` and `a` are mentioned as initial conditions for each test case and are not directly related to the loop head, so we do not need to adjust them.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
