You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of chosen vertices, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the gaps between the chosen vertices and the circular arrangement of vertices from 1 to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
- We have a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
- We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices and no more than `y` additional vertices.
- In this version, `y = 0`, so we can't choose any additional vertices.

### Key Points:
- The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the `x` vertices.
- The number of triangles that can be formed is related to how the chosen vertices are spaced out.

### Approach:
- The code sorts the `x` vertices.
- It then counts the number of pairs of adjacent vertices that are exactly one position apart in the polygon (i.e., they are next to each other).
- For each such pair, it can form a triangle with the next available vertex.
- It also checks the pair formed by the first and last vertices in the sorted list, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
- The final count of triangles is given by the number of such pairs plus `x - 2`.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Sorting**: The code correctly sorts the vertices.
2. **Counting Pairs**: It counts the number of pairs of vertices that are exactly one position apart.
3. **Circular Check**: It also checks the pair formed by the first and last vertices, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
4. **Final Count**: The final count is calculated as the number of such pairs plus `x - 2`.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
  - Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 2)` and `(5, 6)` are one position apart.
  - Circular pair: `(6, 1)` is not one position apart.
  - Count: `2` pairs + `4 - 2 = 2` triangles.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
  - Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 4)`, `(4, 5)`, `(5, 6)`, `(6, 7)`, `(7, 8)` are one position apart.
  - Circular pair: `(8, 1)` is one position apart.
  - Count: `8` pairs + `8 - 2 = 14` triangles. However, this is incorrect because we can only form 6 non-intersecting triangles.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3]`
  - Sorted vertices: `[1, 3]`
  - Pairs: None are one position apart.
  - Circular pair: `(3, 1)` is one position apart.
  - Count: `1` pair + `2 - 2 = 1` triangle. However, this is incorrect because we can form 2 non-intersecting triangles.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the code is flawed for counting the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles. The code does not correctly account for the possibility of forming triangles with vertices that are not exactly one position apart and the constraints of non-intersecting diagonals.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
