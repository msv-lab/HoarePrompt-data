Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of chosen vertices, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the gaps between the chosen vertices and the circular arrangement of vertices from 1 to `n`.**
