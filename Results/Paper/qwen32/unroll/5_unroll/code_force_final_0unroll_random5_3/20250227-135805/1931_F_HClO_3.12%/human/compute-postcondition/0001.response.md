The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the integer `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because the loop runs `t` times. The state of `t` is already given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which ensures that the loop can execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Since the loop head only involves `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and does not need an initial state), the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
