Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of distinct integers in each list and `k` is the number of lists. Each list contains `n` distinct integers `a_{ij}` with `1 <= a_{ij} <= n`, and the first integer `a_{i0}` in each list is the author of the screenshot. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
