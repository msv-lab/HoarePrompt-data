### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by checking if there exists a consistent order of participants that matches the given screenshots. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Single Screenshot Case (m == 1)**:
   - If only one screenshot is given, the program immediately outputs "YES" because any single screenshot can trivially represent a valid order.

2. **Multiple Screenshots Case (m > 1)**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and compares their tail parts (excluding the first element).
   - If the tail parts of the first two screenshots are not identical, it concludes that no consistent order exists and outputs "NO".
   - If they are identical, the program then tries to determine the position where the first elements of the two screenshots should be inserted to form a consistent order.
   - If the first elements of the first two screenshots can be inserted into each other's lists in a way that maintains consistency, the program continues to check the remaining screenshots.
   - For each subsequent screenshot, it checks if the tail part (excluding the first element) matches the previously determined consistent order.
   - If all screenshots match the consistent order, it outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Analysis:

- The logic for handling a single screenshot is straightforward and correct.
- The logic for handling multiple screenshots is more complex but follows a structured approach to determine if a consistent order exists.
- The program handles edge cases such as when the first two screenshots have different tail parts, and it correctly uses the third screenshot (if available) to resolve ambiguities.
- The program iterates through the screenshots and checks the consistency of the order, ensuring that the solution is correct for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a consistent order of participants that matches all given screenshots. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
