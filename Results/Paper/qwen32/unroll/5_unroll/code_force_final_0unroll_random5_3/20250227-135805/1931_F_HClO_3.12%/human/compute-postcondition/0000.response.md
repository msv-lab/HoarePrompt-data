Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} each such that 1 <= a_{ij} <= n, where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and is always at the top of the list. All a_{i0} are different across the k lines for each test case.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other conditions and variables (`n`, `k`, `a_{ij}`) remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
