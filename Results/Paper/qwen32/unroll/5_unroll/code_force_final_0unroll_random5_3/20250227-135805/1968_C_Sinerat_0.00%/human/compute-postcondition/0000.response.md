In the provided loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates a number of times determined by the integer input `n`, which is obtained from `int(input())`.

Given that the loop head only involves the variable `_`, there is no need to adjust `_` itself since it is not used within the loop body. The only state that we need to ensure is that the input `n` is correctly set so that the loop can execute the intended number of times. 

Since the problem states that `n` is already provided as an integer input and is in the range of 2 to 500, we don't need to adjust `n` either. The loop will execute `n` times based on the value of `n` provided.

Therefore, the only state that is relevant to ensure the loop executes is that `n` is correctly provided as an integer input, and the subsequent `n-1` integers are provided as the elements of the array `x`.

State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`. The next line contains `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500) which are the elements of the array `x`.**
