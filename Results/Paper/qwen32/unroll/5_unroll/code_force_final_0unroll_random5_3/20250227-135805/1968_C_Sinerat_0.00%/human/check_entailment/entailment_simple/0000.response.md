Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find an array \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that:
- \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
- \(x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and the list \(x\) of \(n-1\) integers.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - The program initializes the array \(a\) with zeros.
   - It sets \(a[0]\) to 500.
   - For each subsequent element \(a[i]\) (where \(i\) ranges from 1 to \(n-1\)), it sets \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the array \(a\) for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the constructed array \(a\) satisfies the conditions of the problem.

- **Condition \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\)**:
  - \(a[0] = 500\) which is within the range.
  - For \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\), since \(x[i-1] \le 500\) and the maximum value of \(a[i-1]\) can be at most \(500 + 500(n-2) = 500n - 500\), which is still within \(10^9\) for \(n \le 500\).

- **Condition \(x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1}\)**:
  - By construction, \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\), so \(a[i] \mod a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) \mod a[i-1] = x[i-1]\).
  - This means \(x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1}\) is satisfied for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array \(a\) that satisfies all the conditions of the problem for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
