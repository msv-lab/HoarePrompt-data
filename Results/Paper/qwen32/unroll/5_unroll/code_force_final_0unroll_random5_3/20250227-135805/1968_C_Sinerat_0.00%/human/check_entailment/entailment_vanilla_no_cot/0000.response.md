Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program initializes the first element of the array `a` to 500 and then sets each subsequent element by adding the corresponding element from `x` to the previous element in `a`. This approach does not guarantee that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

To solve the problem correctly, one can initialize `a[0]` to a sufficiently large number (e.g., `501` to ensure `a[0] > x[0]`) and then set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for `i >= 1`. However, this simple addition does not ensure the modulo condition is met. A correct approach would be to set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` if `a[i-1] > x[i-1]`, but if `a[i-1] <= x[i-1]`, we need to adjust `a[i-1]` to be greater than `x[i-1]` while still satisfying the modulo condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 501  # Ensure a[0] is greater than any possible x[i]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)

# This version still might not be fully correct for all edge cases.
# A more robust solution would be:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = x[0] + 1  # Ensure a[0] > x[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)

# This ensures that a[0] is greater than x[0] and the constraints are met.
```

In the provided program, the logic for ensuring `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]` is not correctly implemented, hence the program is incorrect.
