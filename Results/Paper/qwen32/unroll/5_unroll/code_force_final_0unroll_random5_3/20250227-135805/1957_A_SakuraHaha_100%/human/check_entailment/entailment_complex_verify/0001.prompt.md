You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code:

for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks available. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: t is the number of test cases; n is the number of sticks available for the current test case; a is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case; ans is 0; cnt is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: t is the number of test cases; n is the number of sticks available for the current test case; a is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case; ans is the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length; cnt is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks. Each regular polygon requires all its sides to be of equal length, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:

1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths.
3. It then counts the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary.
4. For each unique stick length, it calculates how many polygons can be formed using that length by dividing the count by 3 and adding the result to the answer.
5. Finally, it prints the answer.

### Issues in the Program

The main issue with the program is the assumption that each polygon requires 3 sides (triangles). However, the problem statement does not specify the type of polygons, and it should consider polygons with more than 3 sides.

- **Polygons with more than 3 sides:** The program should check for all possible polygon sizes (from 3 to `n`) and determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using the given sticks.
- **Incorrect logic:** The current logic only considers forming triangles (polygons with 3 sides), which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:

1. For each unique stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using that stick length. This involves checking all possible polygon sizes (from 3 to the count of that stick length).
2. Sum up the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it only considers forming triangles and does not account for polygons with more than 3 sides.

**Correctness: False**
