Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are some of the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Quaffle Handling**:
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player to the Quaffle carrier.
   - The Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field when a goal is scored, but the program does not handle this correctly in all cases.

2. **Incorrect Goal Scoring**:
   - The program checks if a player is at a goal using `if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']`. Since `goals` is a list of tuples and `players[mo[0]]` is also a tuple, this check is correct, but the subsequent logic for handling the Quaffle and scoring is flawed.
   - The program does not correctly reset the Quaffle position after a goal is scored.

3. **Incorrect Elimination Handling**:
   - The program prints elimination events, but it does not correctly remove the eliminated player from the game or handle the Quaffle if the eliminated player was carrying it.

4. **Incorrect Movement Handling**:
   - The movement function `func_1` is correctly defined but not used properly in all cases. The movement logic for the Bludger and other entities needs to be consistent and correctly handle all possible interactions.

5. **Incorrect Output Formatting**:
   - The final score is printed as `FINAL SCORE: pointsr pointsb`, but the problem description specifies that the red team's score should come first.

Here is a corrected version of the program with these issues addressed:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            for k, v in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch[1] = ''
                    del players[k]
                    break
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if quidditch[0] == players[mo[0]]:
            quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
            quidditch[1] = ''
            if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                quidditch[0] = middle
            elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
                quidditch[0] = middle
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This version of the program addresses the issues mentioned and should correctly solve the problem as described.
