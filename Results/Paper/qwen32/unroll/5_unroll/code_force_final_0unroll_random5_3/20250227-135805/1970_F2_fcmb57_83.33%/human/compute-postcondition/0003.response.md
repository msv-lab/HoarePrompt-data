Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, representing the number of lines (N) and the number of columns (M) in the field, respectively. Both `a` and `b` are odd integers within the range of 3 to 99. The function returns a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`, where `x` and `y` are both equal to `a`. The values of `dx` and `dy` are not defined in the initial state and are thus unknown.**
