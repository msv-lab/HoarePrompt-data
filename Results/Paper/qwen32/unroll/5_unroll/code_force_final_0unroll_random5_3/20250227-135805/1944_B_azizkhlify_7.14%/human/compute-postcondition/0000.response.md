To determine the state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a certain number of times. The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`. Therefore, the only thing we need to adjust is the input to ensure that the loop can execute.

Since the loop will execute `int(input())` times, we need to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer. Given the context of the problem, the input is expected to be the integer `n` from the problem statement.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input is a valid integer `n` within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4).

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4, and the input is `n`**
