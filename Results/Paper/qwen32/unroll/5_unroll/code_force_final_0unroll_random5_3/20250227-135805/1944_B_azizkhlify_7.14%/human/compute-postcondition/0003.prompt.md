You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        l = [0] * n

                    re += 1
                    res.append(a[i])
                if re == k:

                if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                    print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                    ur += 2
                if ul == ur:
                    break
        
        print()
        
    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4` and `1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋`, and a list of `2n` integers `a` where each integer from 1 to `n` occurs exactly twice. The function returns an integer representing the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, a_j)` that can be formed such that `a_i` and `a_j` are equal and the indices `i` and `j` are at most `k` positions apart.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
