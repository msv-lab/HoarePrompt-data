You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `2n` integers `a` where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It prints pairs of equal integers from the list, ensuring that the indices of the pairs are at most `k` positions apart. After printing such pairs from the first half of the list, it prints additional pairs from the second half if needed to balance the output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.
- We need to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
  - `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
  - `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
  - The bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` are initialized to count occurrences of each number in the first `n` and last `n` elements of `a` respectively.
   - The `l` array counts occurrences of numbers in the first half of `a`.
   - The `r` array counts occurrences of numbers in the second half of `a`.

3. **Building `l` and `r` Arrays:**
   - The program first tries to add pairs of identical numbers from the first half to `l` until `l` reaches the required length `2k`.
   - If `l` still needs more elements to reach `2k`, it adds unique numbers from the first half.
   - It then mirrors this process for `r` by adding pairs of identical numbers from the second half until `r` matches the length and XOR of `l`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Issues:
- **XOR Calculation:** The program does not calculate the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` to ensure they are equal. It simply tries to match the length and presence of elements but does not verify the XOR condition.
- **Handling of `ul` and `ur`:** The variables `ul` and `ur` are used to track the number of elements added to `l` and `r` respectively. However, the logic for adjusting `r` based on `ul` is flawed and doesn't ensure the XOR condition.
- **Edge Cases:** The program may not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is equal to `n/2` or when there are unique numbers that need to be carefully chosen to satisfy the XOR condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. It focuses on matching the length and presence of elements but does not verify the XOR condition.
