Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; `inf` is 200001.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, while the description of `inf` remains unchanged as it is a constant value and not affected by the code snippet.
