The code snippet provided initializes a variable `inf` with the value `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables `t` or `n` from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `inf` with its specific value.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes; `inf` is 200001.**
