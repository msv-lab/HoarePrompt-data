Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in its function definition and usage. The function `func_1()` is defined after it is called, which will result in a `NameError`. The program should not have the `func_1()` call before the function definition.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])

func_1()
```

Apart from the function definition issue, the logic of the program seems correct. It precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and then uses this precomputed data to answer each test case in constant time, which is efficient given the problem constraints. Therefore, the original logic is correct, but the function call and definition order is incorrect.
