The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4** 

Since `t` is already defined as being in the range 1 to 10^4, no further adjustment is needed to ensure the loop will execute. The loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is within the specified range.
