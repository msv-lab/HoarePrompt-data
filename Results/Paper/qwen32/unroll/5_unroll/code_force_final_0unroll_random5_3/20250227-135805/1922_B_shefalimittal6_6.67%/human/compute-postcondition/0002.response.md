To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the state. The loop processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 numbers that are the same or 2 numbers that are the same and a third number that is different from the first two.

The loop maintains a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each number in the list. It then calculates the result `res` based on these counts. The result is printed for each test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately after processing, the state after the loop finishes is that all test cases have been processed and their respective results have been printed.

The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `res` will be reset for each iteration of the outer loop. However, since the results are printed immediately, the final state of these variables is not retained after the loop finishes.

Output State: **All test cases have been processed and their respective results have been printed.**
