Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then prints the difference (P - M). However, the task requires splitting the string into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized, where the penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate that the program is incorrect:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

While the program happens to produce the correct output for this specific input, it does not provide the correct output for all cases. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
5
-----
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-5
```

The program incorrectly outputs -5 instead of 5 because it simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters without considering the penalty calculation or optimal splitting of the string into subarrays.

Thus, the program is not correct for all potential cases and should be considered incorrect.
