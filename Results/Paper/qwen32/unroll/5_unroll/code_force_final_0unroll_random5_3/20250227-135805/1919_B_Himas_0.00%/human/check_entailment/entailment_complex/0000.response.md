Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array derived from the string `s`. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program, however, simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints this difference. This does not account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The given program's logic does not address this requirement, and thus it does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
