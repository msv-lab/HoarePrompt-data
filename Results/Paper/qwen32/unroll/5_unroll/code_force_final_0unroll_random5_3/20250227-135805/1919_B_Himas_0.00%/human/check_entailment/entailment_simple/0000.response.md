Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The task is to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays, where the penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The provided code, however, simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string for each test case and prints this difference. This does not address the problem of minimizing the penalty as described.

The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to determine the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The provided code does not implement any such strategy.

Correctness: **False**
