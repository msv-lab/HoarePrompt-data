Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there are a few issues with the program that make it incorrect for the given problem statement.

1. **Initialization of `soma`**: The variable `soma` is initialized outside of the loop that processes each test case. This means that the sum of the digits for all test cases will be accumulated in the same `soma` variable, leading to incorrect results for multiple test cases. The `soma` should be re-initialized for each test case.

2. **Loop Range**: The loop `for i in range(n)` starts from 0, but the problem description states that the integers are from 1 to n. Therefore, the loop should start from 1.

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads `N` (the number of test cases) but then does not use it correctly. It reads `N` lines of input for each test case, which is incorrect. It should read `N` test cases, each consisting of a single integer `n`.

4. **Output**: The program should print the result for each test case immediately after processing it, not after all test cases have been processed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

Given these issues, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
