### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Program Structure:**
   - The program starts by initializing `soma` to 0.
   - It reads the number of test cases `N`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then iterates from 0 to `n-1`, summing the digits of each number using the function `func_1`.
   - Finally, it prints the total sum `soma`.

2. **Function `func_1(n)`:**
   - This function takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It converts the integer to a string, iterates through each character (digit), converts it back to an integer, and sums these integers.

3. **Issues:**
   - The program reads `N` test cases but then iterates over `n` from 0 to `n-1` for each test case, which is incorrect. It should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) as per the problem description.
   - The program prints the total sum `soma` after processing all test cases, which is incorrect. It should print the sum for each test case separately.

4. **Corrected Program:**
   - For each test case, the program should reset `soma` to 0.
   - It should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and sum the digits of each number.
   - It should print the sum for each test case immediately after processing it.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it doesn't follow the problem requirements accurately. It iterates from 0 to `n-1` instead of 1 to `n` and prints the total sum after all test cases instead of printing the sum for each test case separately.

**Correctness: False**
