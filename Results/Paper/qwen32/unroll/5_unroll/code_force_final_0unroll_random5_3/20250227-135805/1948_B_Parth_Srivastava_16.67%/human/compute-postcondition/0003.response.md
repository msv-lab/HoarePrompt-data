Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of integers derived from the string input by the user; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `x` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `k`) retain their initial values and conditions.
