The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the execution of this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, and `tests` is the integer input representing the number of test cases.**
