To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the provided for loop:

```python
for i in range(tests):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range is determined by `tests`. The loop will execute if `tests` is greater than 0 because `range(tests)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `tests - 1`.

Let's analyze the given state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `tests` is the integer input representing the number of test cases

From this, we can see that the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly involved in the loop's execution. The only variable that affects the loop's execution is `tests`.

To ensure the loop executes, `tests` must be greater than 0. The current state already specifies that `tests` is the integer input representing the number of test cases, but we need to ensure it is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `tests` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `tests` is an integer greater than 0**
