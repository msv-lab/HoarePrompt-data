The only variables in the loop head are `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. The `range(x - 1, 1, -1)` function will generate values starting from `x - 1` down to `2` (since the stop value `1` is exclusive). 

For the loop to execute, `x - 1` must be greater than `1`, which means `x` must be greater than `2`. If `x` is `2` or less, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty.

Given the initial state that `x` is an integer such that `2 <= x <= 1000`, the loop will not execute if `x` is exactly `2`. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to be greater than `2`.

Since `max_val` is not directly related to the execution of the loop, we do not need to adjust it for the loop to execute. However, it is part of the initial state, so we should include it in the final state description.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1**
