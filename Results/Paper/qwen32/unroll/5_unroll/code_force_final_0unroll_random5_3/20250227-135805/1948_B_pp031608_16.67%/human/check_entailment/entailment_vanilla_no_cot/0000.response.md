Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Placement of `func_1` Check**: The check for whether the list is sorted (`if not func_1(list1)`) is placed inside the loop iterating over the list elements. This means that the function is only called conditionally and not after all potential modifications, which could lead to incorrect conclusions about whether the list can be sorted.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digit Insertion**: The logic for inserting digits of a number is incorrect. The current logic only handles two-digit numbers and does not correctly split numbers into their individual digits. For example, for a number like `123`, the program would only split it into `12` and `3`, rather than `1`, `2`, and `3`.

3. **Lack of Iterative Checking**: The program does not ensure that it iteratively checks and modifies the list until no more changes can be made or the list is sorted. The current implementation only makes one pass through the list and does not account for the possibility that further splits might be needed to achieve a sorted list.

4. **Inefficient and Incorrect Looping**: The loop that checks and modifies the list is not structured to handle all cases correctly. It should ensure that after each split, the list is checked again to see if further splits are necessary or if the list is now sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(lst):
    while True:
        modified = False
        new_lst = []
        for num in lst:
            if num >= 10:
                modified = True
                for digit in str(num):
                    new_lst.append(int(digit))
            else:
                new_lst.append(num)
        if not modified:
            break
        lst = new_lst
    return lst == sorted(lst)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(lst):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

In this corrected version, the `can_be_sorted` function iteratively splits numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits and checks if the list can be sorted after all possible splits.
