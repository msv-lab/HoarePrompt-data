Let's analyze the given program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Program Analysis

The program aims to determine if it's possible to sort an array using a specific operation: splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits.

#### Key Points:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Main Logic**: The program iterates through the list and checks if it is sorted. If not, it checks if the current element and the previous one are out of order and if the previous one is greater than or equal to 10. If these conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits.

### Issues Identified in the Original Program:
1. **Single Pass Check**: The program only performs one pass through the list and does not repeat the process until the list is either sorted or no more splits can be made.
2. **Incorrect Split Logic**: The logic for splitting numbers and inserting digits back into the list is flawed. It only considers splitting the previous element if it is greater than the current element, which is not always the correct condition.
3. **Initial Sorted Check**: The program does not handle the case where the list is already sorted initially.

### Annotations:
The annotations state that the list `lst` is a list of integers and the function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted. However, the annotations do not address the main logic issues of the program.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the second test case from the example:
- Input: `12 28 5`
- The program checks if the list is sorted, which it is not.
- It then checks if `12` and `28` are out of order, which they are not.
- It checks if `28` and `5` are out of order, which they are. However, it does not split `28` into `2` and `8` because `28` is not greater than `5`.
- The program prints `NO`, which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed and does not cover all cases.

### Correctness:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program. The program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split or where the split operation needs to be repeated multiple times. The program also does not handle the case where the list is already sorted initially.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the reasons mentioned above.

**Final: False**
