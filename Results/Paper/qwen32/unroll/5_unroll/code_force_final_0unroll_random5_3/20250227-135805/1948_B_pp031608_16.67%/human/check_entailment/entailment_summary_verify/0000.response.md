Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summary to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine whether it is possible to sort an array of integers in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

### Program Analysis
1. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The program checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10. If so, it splits the previous element into its digits.
   - This logic is flawed because the transformation should be applied to any element that is at least 10, regardless of the previous element's value.

2. **Iterative Transformation**:
   - The program only performs one pass through the array to check and split elements. It does not iteratively apply the transformation until no more transformations can be made.
   - This is a critical issue because the problem description allows for multiple transformations.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the list is sorted. However, the function summary incorrectly states that it checks if sublists are sorted lexicographically.
   - The function itself is correctly defined to check if a single list is sorted, but it is not used correctly in the main logic.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where no transformation can help in sorting the array.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary is incorrect. It states that `func_1` checks if sublists are sorted lexicographically, which is not the case. The function `func_1` is actually checking if a single list is sorted in non-descending order.

### Correctness of the Program
Given the issues identified in the transformation logic and the lack of iterative transformation, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed transformation logic and the lack of iterative transformation.
