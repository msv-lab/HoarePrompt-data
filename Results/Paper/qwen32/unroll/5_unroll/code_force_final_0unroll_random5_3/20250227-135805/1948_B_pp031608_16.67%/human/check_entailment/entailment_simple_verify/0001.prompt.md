You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, where each sublist contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The outer list lst contains t sublists (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), where each sublist represents the array a for a separate test case.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if lst is already sorted in lexicographical order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine whether it is possible to sort the array using the specified operation. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. The program uses a function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted. This function is defined after the loop and is used correctly to check the sorted state of the list.
2. The main logic of the program is flawed. The program iterates through the list and checks if the list is sorted using `func_1`. If it is not sorted, it checks if the current element and the previous one are out of order and if the previous one is greater than or equal to 10. If these conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element into its digits.
3. However, the logic for splitting the numbers and inserting them back into the list is incorrect. The program only performs the operation once per iteration and does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split or where the split operation needs to be repeated multiple times.
4. The program does not handle the case where the split operation causes the list to become sorted in a subsequent iteration.
5. The program does not correctly handle the case where the list is already sorted initially.

Let's consider the second test case in the example:
Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```
For the second test case, the program will check if the list `[12, 28, 5]` is sorted, which it is not. It will then check if `12` and `28` are out of order, which they are not. It will then check if `28` and `5` are out of order, which they are. However, it will not split `28` into `2` and `8` because `28` is not greater than `5`. The program will then print `NO`, which is correct in this case, but the logic is flawed and does not cover all cases.

A correct solution would need to repeatedly apply the split operation until no more splits can be made or until the list is sorted. The current program does not implement this logic correctly.
