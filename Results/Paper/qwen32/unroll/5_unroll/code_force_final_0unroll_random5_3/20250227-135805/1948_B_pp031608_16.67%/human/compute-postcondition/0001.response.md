Output State: **The program returns True if lst is already sorted in lexicographical order, otherwise it returns False.**

Explanation: The program checks if `lst` is equal to `sorted_lst`, which is the lexicographically sorted version of `lst`. If they are equal, it means `lst` is already sorted, and the program returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
