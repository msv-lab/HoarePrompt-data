To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and its adherence to the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
3. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a sequence of numbers using powers of 2 up to `2^23` (which is `8388608`), and then modifies this sequence based on the value of `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`.
3. It generates a list `nums` containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^23`.
4. It finds the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`, and removes that power of 2 from `nums`.
5. It then appends `k - power_of_2`, `k + 1`, and `k + power_of_2 + 1` to `nums`.
6. Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

### Correctness Verification:
1. **Generating Powers of 2**: The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which can generate all sums from `1` to `8388607` through their subsequences.
2. **Adjusting for `k`**: By removing a specific power of 2 and adding `k - power_of_2`, `k + 1`, and `k + power_of_2 + 1`, the program aims to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`, while still allowing all other sums up to `n` (except `k`).

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- **Exceeding `n`**: If `k` is large, the additions `k + 1` and `k + power_of_2 + 1` can exceed `n`, which is not allowed.
- **Ensuring All Sums**: The approach does not guarantee that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed, especially when `n` is small compared to the powers of 2 being used.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always generate a valid sequence `a` that meets all the problem requirements, particularly in ensuring that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed without exceeding `n` or including `k` as a subsequence sum.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
