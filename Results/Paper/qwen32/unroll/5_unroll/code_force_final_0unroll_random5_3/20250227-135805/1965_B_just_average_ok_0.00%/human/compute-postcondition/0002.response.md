Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is the size of a set and `k` is an integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
