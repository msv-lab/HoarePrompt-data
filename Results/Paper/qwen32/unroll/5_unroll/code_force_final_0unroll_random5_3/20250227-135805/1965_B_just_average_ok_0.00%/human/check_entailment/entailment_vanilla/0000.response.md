To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to verify if it meets the criteria specified in the problem:

1. **No subsequence of the sequence sums to k**.
2. **For all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to v**.

Let's break down the program and analyze its logic:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Generating Powers of 2**:
   - The program starts by generating the first 24 powers of 2, which can be used to form any integer from 1 to \(2^{24}-1\) as a sum of a subset of these numbers. This is a standard approach for generating numbers using binary representation.
   - `nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]` generates a list of numbers: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots, 2^{23}]\).

2. **Finding the Position of k in the Powers of 2**:
   - The program then finds the position `idx` such that \(2^{idx} \leq k < 2^{idx+1}\).
   - `while k >= 1 << idx: idx += 1` adjusts `idx` to the correct position.

3. **Adjusting the Sequence to Exclude k**:
   - The program then adds three new numbers to the sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This is the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This is the next integer after `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is a larger number that also ensures no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - `nums.append(k - nums[idx])`
   - `nums.append(k + 1)`
   - `nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)`

4. **Removing a Power of 2**:
   - The program removes one of the powers of 2 from the sequence to ensure the sequence size does not exceed 25.
   - `nums.remove(1 << idx)`

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Verification

- **No Subsequence Sums to k**:
  - By adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` and removing `nums[idx]`, the program ensures that no subsequence of the resulting list sums to `k`. This is because any subsequence that could have summed to `k` before the removal would now either include one of the new numbers or be invalid due to the removal of `nums[idx]`.

- **Subsequences Sum to All v ≠ k**:
  - The sequence of powers of 2 can form any integer from 1 to \(2^{24}-1\). By adding the new numbers and removing one power of 2, the program still maintains the ability to form all integers from 1 to \(n\) except `k` because the new numbers and the remaining powers of 2 are carefully chosen to cover all possible sums except `k`.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
