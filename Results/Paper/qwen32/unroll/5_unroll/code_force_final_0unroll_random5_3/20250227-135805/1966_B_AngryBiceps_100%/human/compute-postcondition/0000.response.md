In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which is obtained from the input. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. 

The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the `range(int(input()))`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to the program results in a valid integer `t` that is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is already described as an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. No additional adjustments are needed for `t` itself, but we need to ensure that the input format is correct and that `t` is indeed an integer within the specified range.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input should provide this integer value for the loop to execute.**
