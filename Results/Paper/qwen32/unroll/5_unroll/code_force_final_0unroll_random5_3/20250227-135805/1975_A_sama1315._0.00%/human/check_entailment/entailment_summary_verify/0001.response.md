### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in `func_1`. The function only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation to achieve a sorted order. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### Problem Understanding:
The operation allows splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. This means the array can be rearranged in a way that might lead to a sorted order even if it is not initially sorted.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Current Implementation**:
     - Checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - If sorted, returns 'Yes'.
     - If not sorted, checks if there is any element greater than the next element.
     - If found, returns 'No'.
     - Otherwise, returns 'Yes' (redundant).
   - **Flaw**:
     - The function fails to consider the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation to achieve a sorted order. It only checks for the initial sorted state.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Implementation**:
     - Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
     - Processes each test case by calling `func_1` and collects the results.
     - Prints the results, each on a new line.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation, we need to find a point in the array where the sequence can be split into two non-decreasing parts such that the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix. Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Try to find a valid split point
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if arr[0:i] and arr[i:n] are non-decreasing
        if all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i - 1)) and all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i, n - 1)):
            # Check if the last element of the first part is <= the first element of the second part
            if i == 0 or i == n or arr[i - 1] <= arr[i]:
                return 'Yes'
    
    return 'No'
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in `func_1`. The function does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
