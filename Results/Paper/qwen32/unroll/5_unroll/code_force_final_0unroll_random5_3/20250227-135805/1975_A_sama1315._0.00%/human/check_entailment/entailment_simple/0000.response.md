Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly swapping its prefix and suffix. The key observation here is that this operation can only rearrange the array by rotating it, but it cannot change the relative order of elements within the array. Therefore, the array can be sorted by this operation if and only if it is already sorted or can be rotated to become sorted.

The provided program checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function in `func_1`. If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it incorrectly returns 'No' based on the condition `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`, which is redundant and does not correctly address the problem. However, the primary issue is that the program does not consider the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order.

The correct approach would involve finding a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted. This would require checking if there exists a point where the array can be rotated into a sorted order, which is not addressed by the current implementation.

Given the current implementation, it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order. Therefore, the program is incorrect for cases where the array can be sorted by rotation but is not already sorted.

Correctness: **False**
