The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of positive integers and `input` is a function assigned to `sys.stdin.read`. After executing the code, `data` will hold the split input values as strings, and `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
