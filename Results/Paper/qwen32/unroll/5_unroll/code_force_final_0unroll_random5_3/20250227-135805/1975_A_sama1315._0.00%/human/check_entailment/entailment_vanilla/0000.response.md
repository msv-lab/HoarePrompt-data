Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these two parts.

### Key Observations
1. **Operation Effect**: Swapping a prefix and suffix can only change the order of elements within the array, but it cannot change the relative order of elements within the prefix or within the suffix. Therefore, if the array can be sorted by performing this operation, it must be possible to split the array into two parts such that the suffix is non-decreasing and the prefix is non-decreasing, and the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix.
2. **Checking the Condition**: To check if the array can be sorted by the operation, we need to find a point in the array where the sequence can be split into two non-decreasing parts. This means we need to find a point where the array stops increasing, and then continues increasing again.

### Code Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code functions.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: This function checks if an array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by the specified operation.
- **Implementation**:
  - It first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
  - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
  - If there is any element that is greater than the next element (`any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`), it returns 'No'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Yes' (which is redundant since the previous condition would have already returned 'No' if the array was not sorted).

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- **Implementation**:
  - It reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
  - It iterates over the number of test cases (`t`), reads the size of each array (`n`), reads the array elements, and passes the array to `func_1`.
  - It collects the results for each test case and prints them joined by newlines.

### Correctness Evaluation
- **Function `func_1`**: The function incorrectly assumes that if the array is not already sorted, it cannot be sorted by the operation. This is not true. The operation allows for rearranging the array in a way that could potentially sort it, even if it is not sorted initially. For example, the array `[3, 1, 2]` can be split into `[3]` and `[1, 2]`, swapped to `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.
- **Function `func_2`**: The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.

### Conclusion
The provided code is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient.

Correctness: **False**
