### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1(arr)`. The function incorrectly assumes that if the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order, it cannot be sorted by swapping any prefix and suffix. This is not true because the operation allows for more complex rearrangements.

To illustrate, consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The array is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
- However, by splitting the array into `x=[3]` and `y=[1, 2]` and swapping them, we get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

The function `func_1(arr)` does not account for such rearrangements and simply returns "No" if the array is not initially sorted. This leads to incorrect results for cases where the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the program.

### Final:
Final: **False**
