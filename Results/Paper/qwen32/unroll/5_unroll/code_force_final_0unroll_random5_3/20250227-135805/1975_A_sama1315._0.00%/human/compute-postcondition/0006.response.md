The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The current state provides that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables `arr`, `data`, `index`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `results` is an empty list.**
