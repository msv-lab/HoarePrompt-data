The code snippet initializes an empty list named `digits`. The initial state specifies that `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).

The execution of the code does not affect the `password` variable or the value of `n`. The only change is the initialization of the `digits` list, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `digits` is an empty list.**
