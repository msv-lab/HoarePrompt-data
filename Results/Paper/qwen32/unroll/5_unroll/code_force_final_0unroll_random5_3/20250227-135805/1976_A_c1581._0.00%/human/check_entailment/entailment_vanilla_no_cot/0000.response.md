Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a given password meets Monocarp's criteria for being strong. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to validate each password.
   - It separates the digits and letters into two lists, `digits` and `letters`.
   - It then checks if any letter appears after a digit in the password. If so, it returns "NO".
   - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns "NO".
   - It checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns "NO".
   - If all checks pass, it returns "YES".

3. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are collected in the `results` list.
   - Finally, the program prints the results, one per line.

The logic in `func_1` correctly implements all the conditions for a strong password as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
