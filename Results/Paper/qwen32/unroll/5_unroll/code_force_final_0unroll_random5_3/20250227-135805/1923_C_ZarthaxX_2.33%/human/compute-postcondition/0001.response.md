The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element to an integer, then assigns this list of integers to the variable `nums`. This means that `nums` will now hold the list of integers read from the input.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nums`, which is assigned the list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, `r_i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input, where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; The array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of integers read from input.**
