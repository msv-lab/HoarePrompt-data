You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: l is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the last test case's strings a, b, and c.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Understanding:
The program needs to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template.
- String `c` does not match the template.

The template is defined such that:
- If a character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in the string must be the same.
- If a character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in the string must be different (from the lowercase version of the template character).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program has a few issues:
1. **Initialization of `l`:** The variable `l` is initialized to `'YES'` outside the loop, meaning it will always be `'YES'` unless explicitly changed inside the loop.
2. **Logic for Determining `l`:** The program checks if `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` for each position `i`. If this condition is met, it sets `l` to `'YES'`. However, this logic is flawed because:
   - The program does not check if `a[i] == b[i]` and if they match the template.
   - The program does not ensure that `c[i]` does not match the template.
   - The `else` block is incorrectly placed after the inner loop, which will always execute and set `l` to `'NO'` if the loop completes without breaking, which is not the intended logic.
3. **Output:** The program prints `l` after each test case, which should be either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on whether a valid template exists.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. For each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
   - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` must be uppercase (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from `c[i]` if they match the template).
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` must be lowercase (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as the template character).
2. Check if `c[i]` does not match the template for any `i`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program logic, the provided program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a valid template exists for each test case.
