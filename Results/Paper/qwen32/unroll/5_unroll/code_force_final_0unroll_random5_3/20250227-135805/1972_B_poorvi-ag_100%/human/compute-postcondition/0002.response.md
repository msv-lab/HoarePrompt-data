The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as `i` will start from 0 and increment until `t-1`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range(t)` function and does not need to be adjusted manually before the loop starts.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute, provided `t` is within the given range.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `s` for each test case remain unchanged; `results` is an empty list**
