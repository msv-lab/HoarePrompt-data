The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The state of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `arr` do not directly affect the execution of this specific for loop, as they are not part of the loop head.

Given that `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, and the loop iterates over this list, we need to ensure that `results` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `s` for each test case remain unchanged; `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least 1 element; `i` is the first element in `results`**
