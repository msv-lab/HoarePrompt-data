You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.

    #State: A series of printed lines for each test case based on the conditions: if k >= 2 and n == k, prints k repeated k times; if k >= 2 and n != k, prints -1; if k < 2, prints numbers from 1 to n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a sequence of numbers based on the conditions: if `k >= 2` and `n == k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times; if `k >= 2` and `n != k`, it prints `-1`; if `k < 2`, it prints numbers from `1` to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The constraints are:
- `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^3`
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^3`.

### Provided Program

Here is the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
```

### Program Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input from standard input.
   - It iterates over each test case, starting from the second line (since the first line contains the number of test cases).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then checks the value of `k`:
     - **If `k >= 2`:**
       - If `n == k`, it prints an array of length `n` where all elements are `k`. This array will have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts because all elements are the same, making all cyclic shifts identical and sorted.
       - If `n != k`, it prints `-1` because it's not possible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts if `k` is not equal to `n` and `k >= 2`.
     - **If `k < 2`:**
       - It prints an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Case `k >= 2`:**
  - If `n == k`, the program correctly outputs an array where all elements are the same, ensuring all `n` (which is equal to `k`) cyclic shifts are sorted.
  - If `n != k`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is not equal to `n` and `k >= 2`.

- **Case `k < 2`:**
  - The program outputs an increasing sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This sequence has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the sequence itself. This is correct for `k = 1`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all specified cases based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
