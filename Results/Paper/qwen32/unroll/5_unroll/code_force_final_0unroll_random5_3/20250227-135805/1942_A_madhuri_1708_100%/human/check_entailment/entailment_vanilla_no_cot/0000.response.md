Let's analyze the provided program in the context of the problem description.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
2. If `k >= 2`, it checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`. If not, it prints `-1`.
3. If `k < 2`, it prints an array of `n` elements, where the i-th element is `i + 1`.

Now, let's verify if this logic is correct:

- **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
  - If `n == k`, the program outputs an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`. This array indeed has `n` cyclic shifts, all of which are sorted because all elements are the same. This is a valid solution.
  - If `n != k`, the program outputs `-1`. This is also correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts if `k < n`. If `k > n`, it's also impossible because there can't be more sorted cyclic shifts than there are elements in the array.

- **Case 2: `k < 2`**
  - If `k == 1`, the program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself), which is correct.
  - If `k == 0`, the program does not handle this case explicitly. However, the problem constraints specify `1 <= k <= n`, so `k == 0` should not occur.

However, there's a critical issue with the program. It does not handle the case when `k == 2` and `n > k`. In this scenario, the program outputs `-1`, but there can be valid arrays that satisfy the condition. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]` (cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 2]`, where the first and third are sorted).

Thus, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all valid cases correctly.

**Correctness: False**
