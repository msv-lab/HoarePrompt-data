The code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. This action does not affect the initial state of `expression` or `length`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `count` variable with a value of 0.

Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000; `count` is 0**.
