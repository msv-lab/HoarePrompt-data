Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the penalty for splitting the array optimally. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which does not align with the penalty calculation described in the problem.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The provided solution does not implement such a strategy and thus does not solve the problem correctly.
