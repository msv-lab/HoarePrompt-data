Let's analyze the given Python program and the problem description step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself, which consists of '+' and '-' characters.

2. **Logic to Calculate Penalty**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum penalty.
   - The function iterates over the string and keeps a running balance (incrementing for '+', decrementing for '-').
   - Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments the `count` and resets the balance to 0.
   - After processing the entire string, it adds 1 to the `count` if the balance is positive.

### Correctness Analysis

The provided program's logic to calculate the minimum penalty is not correct based on the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Strategy**:
   - The program attempts to split the array based on the balance becoming negative, but this approach does not guarantee an optimal splitting strategy.
   - The optimal strategy involves finding the best way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized, which is not achieved by simply resetting the balance when it becomes negative.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the penalty incorrectly by just counting the number of times the balance becomes negative and adding 1 if the balance is positive at the end.
   - The penalty is supposed to be the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length, which is not considered in the provided program.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify with the third example provided:
     - Input: `+-+-+-`
     - Expected Output: `0`
     - The optimal way to split is `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])`, each subarray having a penalty of `0`.
     - The provided program would likely calculate a penalty greater than `0`.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as per the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
