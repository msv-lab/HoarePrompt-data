### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program. The program does not implement a strategy to optimally split the array to minimize the penalty, as described in the problem statement. Instead, it uses an incorrect approach that involves splitting the string by the character `'-'` and counting the number of times the cumulative balance goes negative, which does not align with the goal of minimizing the penalty.

Let's break down the issues again:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Strategy**:
   - The program splits the string `s` by `'-'` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts. This step is unrelated to finding the optimal splits that minimize the penalty.
   - The optimal splits are not determined by the positions of `'-'` characters alone.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the balance is positive at the end. This logic does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The function does not calculate this penalty for any subarrays.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, one would need to implement a strategy that considers all possible splits of the array and calculates the penalty for each split. A dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy could be used to find the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect as it does not implement a strategy to find the optimal splits that minimize the penalty. The original assessment correctly identifies these issues.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
