### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to manipulate a permutation `p` so that after performing a binary search, the element at the `left` pointer position is equal to `x`. The binary search is performed on the array after potentially performing up to 2 swaps.

The provided solution involves the following steps:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `func_2()` reads the integers `n` and `x`.
   - `func_3()` reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.
   
2. **Building the Index Map:**
   - A dictionary `num_indx` is created to map each number in `p` to its index (1-based).
   - A list `seen` is initialized to keep track of which elements have been "seen" during the binary search.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The binary search is simulated with pointers `left` and `right`.
   - During each iteration of the loop, the middle element `mid` is checked against `x`.
   - The `seen` list is updated to mark elements that have been considered.

4. **Determining Swaps:**
   - If the element at `left` is equal to `x`, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` has not been seen during the binary search, a single swap is performed to bring `x` to the `left` position.
   - If `x` has been seen, two swaps are performed to bring an unseen element to the `left` position and then bring `x` to that position.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Single Swap Scenario:** If `x` is not seen during the binary search, it means that `x` is not in the path of the binary search. In this case, swapping `x` with an element in the path of the binary search ensures that `x` will be found at the `left` position after the binary search.
  
- **Double Swap Scenario:** If `x` is seen, it means that `x` is in the path of the binary search, but it did not end up at the `left` position. By swapping an unseen element into the path and then swapping `x` into that position, we ensure that `x` will be at the `left` position after the binary search.

- **No Swap Scenario:** If `x` is already at the `left` position, no swaps are needed.

Given the logic and the constraints, the provided solution satisfies the problem requirements. The binary search is correctly simulated, and the necessary swaps are determined based on the conditions specified.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
