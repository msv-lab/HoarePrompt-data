Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires us to manipulate a permutation so that a binary search algorithm can find a specific number `x` after at most 2 swaps. The binary search algorithm provided in the problem description is a standard binary search algorithm that will eventually converge on the position `l` where `p[l] = x` if the array is sorted. However, the array is not sorted, and we can perform at most 2 swaps to make it possible for the binary search to find `x`.

The provided code does not contain any logic for performing the necessary swaps or for implementing the binary search algorithm. It only contains functions to read input data. Therefore, the provided code is incomplete and does not solve the problem.

The code consists of five functions:
- `func_1()`: Reads an integer from the input.
- `func_2()`: Reads a line of integers from the input and returns them as a map object.
- `func_3()`: Reads a line of integers from the input and returns them as a list.
- `func_4()`: Reads a line of input.
- `func_5()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings.

None of these functions perform the required operations to solve the problem. The code is missing:
- Logic to determine which swaps (if any) are necessary.
- Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- Logic to output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
