### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the issues and validate them based on the annotated code and the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input array `a` as strings, not integers. This is evident from the annotated code where `a.append(ai)` appends each `ai` (which is a string) to the list `a`. This will cause issues when performing arithmetic operations or comparisons on the array elements, as the problem requires integer operations.

2. **Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the array is 2 or not 2. This is incorrect because the problem requires computing the MEX of any subarray and performing operations to maximize the sum of the array. The current implementation does not include any logic to compute the MEX or perform the required operations.

3. **Output**:
   - The program always outputs the same results for arrays of length 2 and arrays of any other length. Specifically, it prints "4 1\n1 2" for arrays of length 2 and "13 0" for arrays of any other length. This is incorrect and does not follow the problem's requirements, as the output should be based on the specific input array and the operations performed.

4. **General Logic**:
   - The program lacks the logic to find the MEX of any subarray and to perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. The MEX calculation and the operations to maximize the sum are essential for solving the problem, and the current implementation does not include any of this logic.

### Validation:
- The annotated code confirms that the program does not correctly handle the input or perform the required operations. It simply checks the length of the array and prints predefined outputs, which is insufficient for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis and the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem and fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
