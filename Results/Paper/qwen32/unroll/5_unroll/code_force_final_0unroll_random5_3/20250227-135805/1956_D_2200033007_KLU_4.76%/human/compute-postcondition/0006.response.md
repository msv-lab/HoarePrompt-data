Postcondition: **`c` is a list of integers where the length of `c` is between 1 and 18 inclusive, and each integer in `c` is between 0 and 10^7 inclusive; `m` is 0. If `c` is equal to 2, the condition is evaluated based on the assumption that `c` is a list, so this part of the condition will never be true. Otherwise, `c` is not equal to 2.**

Given the precondition and the nature of the if condition, the if part will never be true because `c` is a list and cannot be equal to an integer (2). Therefore, the else part will always be executed, meaning `c` will not be equal to 2, and `m` will remain 0.
