### Reasoning:
The provided code is clearly incorrect based on the problem description and the examples given. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input but does not convert the string elements of the array to integers. This leads to incorrect comparisons and operations within the function `func_1`.

2. **Condition Check**: The condition `if (c == 2)` checks if the length of the list `c` is equal to 2, but it does so incorrectly because `c` is the length of the array, not the array itself. This condition will never be true because `c` is an integer (the length of the array), not a list. Therefore, the program will always execute the `else` block and print `13 0`.

3. **Incorrect Output for Different Inputs**: The function `func_1` does not perform any operations on the array to maximize its sum. It only checks the length of the array and prints a fixed output based on that length, which is incorrect for all cases except when the array length is exactly 2. For example, the input `[0, 1]` should result in the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`, but the program will output `13 0` regardless of the input array.

4. **Lack of Logic for Maximizing the Sum**: The function does not implement any logic to find the MEX of any subarray and update the array to maximize the sum, which is the core requirement of the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the logic required to solve the problem and provides incorrect outputs for most inputs.
