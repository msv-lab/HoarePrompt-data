To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the logic of the loop step-by-step.

The loop iterates over each test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to reach the end of the second row (`row2`) starting from the beginning of the first row (`row1`).

1. **Initialization:**
   - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True`, indicating that we can start from the first row.
   - `reachable_second_row` is set to `False`, indicating that we haven't reached the second row yet.

2. **Iteration through each character in the rows:**
   - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
     - If the current character in `row1` is `>`, it means we can move to the next position in `row1`. If we reach the end of `row1` (i.e., `j == n - 1`), we set `reachable_second_row` to `True` because we can move to the second row.
     - If the current character in `row1` is `<`, we can't move further in `row1`, so we set `reachable_first_row` to `False`. If the current character in `row2` is `>`, we can start moving in `row2`, so we set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
     - If the current character in `row2` is `>`, we can move to the next position in `row2`. If we reach the end of `row2` (i.e., `j == n - 1`), we keep `reachable_second_row` as `True` because we have reached the end of `row2`.

3. **Appending the result:**
   - After iterating through the characters in both rows, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it means we can reach the end of `row2`, so we append `'YES'` to `results`.
   - Otherwise, we append `'NO'` to `results`.

After all test cases have been processed, the `results` list will contain the answers for each test case.

**Output State:** The `results` list will contain a series of `'YES'` and `'NO'` strings corresponding to each test case in `test_cases`. The other variables `t` and `test_cases` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **results is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the reachability of the end of row2 from the start of row1 for each test case. `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.**
