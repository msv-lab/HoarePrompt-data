The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n`. 

The code snippet does not modify `t` or `test_cases`; it only initializes the `results` list. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `results` while keeping `t` and `test_cases` unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in `test_cases` is a tuple (n, row1, row2) where n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `results` is an empty list.**
