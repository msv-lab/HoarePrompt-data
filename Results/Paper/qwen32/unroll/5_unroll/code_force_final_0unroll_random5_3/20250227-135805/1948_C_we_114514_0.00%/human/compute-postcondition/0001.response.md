In the given for loop, the loop iterates over each `test_case` in the `test_cases` list. Therefore, the only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is a non-empty list.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head objects**: The loop head contains `test_case` and `test_cases`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `test_cases` has at least one element.
3. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `(n, row1, row2)` that meets the specified conditions: `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

Given the above, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `test_cases` contains at least one valid test case.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple (n, row1, row2) where n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `results` is an empty list**
