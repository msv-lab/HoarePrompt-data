Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" and prints the appropriate result. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The conditions checked are:
- "STAIR" when `a < b < c`
- "PEAK" when `a < b > c`
- "NONE" for all other cases

These conditions match exactly with the problem requirements. The execution summary provided also aligns with the functionality of the program, confirming that it behaves as expected for the given input and output examples.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
