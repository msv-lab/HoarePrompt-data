The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and the constraints on `t` remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided, such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**.
