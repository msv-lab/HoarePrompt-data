Let's walk through the logic of the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Template Definition**: 
   - A template is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters.
   - A string `s` matches a template `t` if:
     - If the `i`-th letter of `t` is lowercase, then `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If the `i`-th letter of `t` is uppercase, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Task**:
   - Given three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`, determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t`, but `c` does not.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Constructing the Template**:
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the program constructs the template as follows:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then the `i`-th character of the template is set to `a[i]` (lowercase).
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then the `i`-th character of the template is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

3. **Checking Matching Conditions**:
   - The program then checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
     - For each position `i`:
       - If the `i`-th character of the template is lowercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to this character.
       - If the `i`-th character of the template is uppercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of this character.
   - The program also checks if `c` does not match the constructed template:
     - For each position `i`:
       - If the `i`-th character of the template is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` is not equal to this character.
       - If the `i`-th character of the template is uppercase, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of this character.

4. **Output**:
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for constructing the template is sound. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then the template character should be lowercase to match both `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template character should be uppercase to ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template but `c[i]` does not if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
- The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template and if `c` does not match the template is also correct based on the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
