### Reasoning:

The given Python program `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n`, and then the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - For each position `i` in the strings:
     - If the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`, they are the same).
     - If the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).

3. **Matching Check:**
   - The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match this character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of this character.
   - Similarly, it checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must match this character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of this character.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 1`, `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`
   - Template: `"C"` (since `a[0] != b[0]`)
   - `a` and `b` match the template (`a[0] != 'c'` and `b[0] != 'c'`).
   - `c` does not match the template (`c[0] == 'c'`).
   - Output: "YES"

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 2`, `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`
   - Template: `"Aa"` (since `a[0] != b[0]` and `a[1] == b[1]`)
   - `a` and `b` match the template (`a[0] != 'a'`, `b[0] != 'a'`, and `a[1] == 'a'`, `b[1] == 'a'`).
   - `c` matches the template (`c[0] == 'a'` and `c[1] == 'a'`).
   - Output: "NO"

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 10`, `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`
   - Template: `"CODEforces"` (since `a[0] != b[0]`, `a[1] != b[1]`, `a[2] == b[2]`, `a[3] != b[3]`, `a[4] == b[4]`, `a[5] == b[5]`, `a[6] == b[6]`, `a[7] == b[7]`, `a[8] == b[8]`, `a[9] == b[9]`)
   - `a` and `b` match the template.
   - `c` does not match the template.
   - Output: "YES"

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`
   - Template: `"ACD"` (since `a[0] != b[0]`, `a[1] == b[1]`, `a[2] != b[2]`)
   - `a` and `b` match the template.
   - `c` matches the template.
   - Output: "NO"

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template that matches strings `a` and `b` but does not match string `c`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
