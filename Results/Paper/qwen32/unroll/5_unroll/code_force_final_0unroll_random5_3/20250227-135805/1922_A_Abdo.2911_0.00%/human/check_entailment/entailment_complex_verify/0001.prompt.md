You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: A sequence of "YES" and "NO" based on the input conditions for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it compares three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n` to determine if a specific condition is met. It prints "YES" if the strings `a` and `b` match in a particular way and `c` does not match that way; otherwise, it prints "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's walk through the logic of the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Template Definition**: 
   - A template is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters.
   - A string `s` matches a template `t` if:
     - If the `i`-th letter of `t` is lowercase, then `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If the `i`-th letter of `t` is uppercase, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Task**:
   - Given three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`, determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t`, but `c` does not.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Constructing the Template**:
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the program constructs the template as follows:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then the `i`-th character of the template is set to `a[i]` (lowercase).
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then the `i`-th character of the template is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

3. **Checking Matching Conditions**:
   - The program then checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
     - For each position `i`:
       - If the `i`-th character of the template is lowercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to this character.
       - If the `i`-th character of the template is uppercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of this character.
   - The program also checks if `c` does not match the constructed template:
     - For each position `i`:
       - If the `i`-th character of the template is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` is not equal to this character.
       - If the `i`-th character of the template is uppercase, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of this character.

4. **Output**:
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for constructing the template is sound. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then the template character should be lowercase to match both `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template character should be uppercase to ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template but `c[i]` does not if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
- The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template and if `c` does not match the template is also correct based on the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
