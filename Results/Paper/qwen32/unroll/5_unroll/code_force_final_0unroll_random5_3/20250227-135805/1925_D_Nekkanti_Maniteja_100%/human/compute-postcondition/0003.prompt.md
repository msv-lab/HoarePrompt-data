You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m (0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)), and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions respectively. The next m lines contain three integers each: a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) representing a pair of friends and f_i (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing their initial friendship value. All pairs of friends are distinct. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: the final value of `s % M` after the loop executes all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions respectively. It also accepts `m` lines of three integers each: `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The function returns the result of the excursions based on the given inputs, handling the constraints provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
