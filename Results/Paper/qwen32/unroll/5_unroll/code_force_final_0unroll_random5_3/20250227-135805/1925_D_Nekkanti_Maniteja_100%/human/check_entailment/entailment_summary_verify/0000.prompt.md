You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of children, pairs of friends with their initial friendship values, and a number of excursions. It calculates and prints a result based on these inputs, specifically the value of `s % M` after performing certain computations involving the number of children, pairs of friends, their friendship values, and the number of excursions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct for calculating the probability of selecting a specific pair.
   - However, the way `c` is used in the loop for `k` iterations is incorrect. The probability `c` should be used to calculate the expected contribution of each friend pair over `k` iterations, but the current code does not correctly compute this.

2. **Accumulating the Sum `s`**:
   - The loop for `k` iterations is not correctly calculating the expected sum of friendship values. The current code attempts to accumulate the sum `s` in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the code `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over `k` iterations.

3. **Handling the Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly accumulates the initial sum of friendship values `a` from the input pairs.
   - However, it does not correctly calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over `k` iterations.

Here is a breakdown of a potential issue:
- Consider a simple test case with `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 3`, and a single friend pair `(1, 2)` with friendship value `f = 1`.
- The expected output should be the expected sum of friendship values over 3 iterations. The probability of selecting the pair `(1, 2)` in each iteration is `1/3` (since there are 3 possible pairs: `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,3)`).
- The expected sum of friendship values should be calculated considering the increase in friendship values over the iterations, but the current code does not do this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Example of a failing case**:
Input:
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 1
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
Actual Output (from the given code):
```
0
```

This shows that the code does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for friendship values over multiple iterations.
