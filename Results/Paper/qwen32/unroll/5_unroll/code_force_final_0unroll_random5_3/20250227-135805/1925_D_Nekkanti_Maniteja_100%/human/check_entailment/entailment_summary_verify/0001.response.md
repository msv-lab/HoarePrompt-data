### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the program to determine if the original assessment is accurate. We'll break down the logic and verify if the program correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.

### Problem Recap:
- **Inputs**:
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`: Number of children.
    - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
    - `k`: Number of excursions.
    - `m` lines follow, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

- **Output**:
  - For each test case, the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in its simplest form.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: The modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: The modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children. This is used to compute the probability of selecting any specific pair of children.
   - `s = 0`: This will store the sum of the expected friendship values.
   - `a = 0`: This will store the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Processing Friendships**:
   - The program iterates over the `m` pairs of friends and sums their initial friendship values into `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum**:
   - The program then iterates `k` times, updating `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to update `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a specific pair and the increase in friendship value over `k` excursions.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: The program uses modular arithmetic correctly for the modulus `M`, but the formula itself is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
- **Probability of Selection**: The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**: For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions is `k * (k + 1) / 2` (since the friendship value increases by 1 each time it is selected).
- **Expected Value for Each Pair**: The expected value for each pair of friends is their initial value plus the expected increase.
- **Total Expected Value**: The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs, weighted by their probability of being selected.

### Correct Formula:
For each pair of friends with initial friendship value `f_i`, the expected value is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = f_i + \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]

The total expected value for all pairs is:
\[ \text{Total Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ \text{Total Expected Value} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_increase = m * (k * (k + 1) // 2)
        total_expected_value = (a + expected_increase) * c % M
        print(total_expected_value)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the formula used in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
