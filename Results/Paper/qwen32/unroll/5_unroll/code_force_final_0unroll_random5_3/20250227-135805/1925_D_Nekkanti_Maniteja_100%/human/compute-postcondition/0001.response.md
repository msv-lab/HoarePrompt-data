Let's break down the code and understand how the output state is calculated after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Code Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: A large prime number used for modulo operations.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: The modular multiplicative inverse of the total possible pairs of children (i.e., `n choose 2`), modulo `M`.
   - `s = 0`: Accumulated sum that we are calculating.
   - `a = 0`: Sum of all initial friendship values.

2. **First Loop (Reading Friendships):**
   - For each pair of friends, read `u`, `v`, and `f`.
   - Accumulate the friendship values into `a`.

3. **Second Loop (Calculating Sum `s`):**
   - For each excursion, update `s` using the formula:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
     Simplifying, this becomes:
     \[
     s = s + c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - This loop runs `k` times.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loops, print `s % M`.

### Simplification of the Second Loop:
The second loop can be simplified by recognizing that it is a summation:
\[
s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a)
\]
This can be split into two summations:
\[
s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i + c \cdot a \cdot k
\]
The sum of the first `k-1` integers is:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2}
\]
Thus, the expression for `s` becomes:
\[
s = c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1) \cdot k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k
\]

### Final Output State:
After the loop, the state of the variables is:
- `s` is calculated as per the above formula.
- `a` is the sum of all initial friendship values.
- `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.
- `M` remains `10 ** 9 + 7`.

However, the output state specifically refers to the final value of `s` modulo `M`.

### Output State:
Output State: **the final value of `s % M` after the loop executes all iterations.**

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the friendship values are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `s`. However, the formula to compute `s` is given above.

For the sake of the format, if we hypothetically compute `s` for a specific test case, it would look like:
Output State: **computed_value_of_s_mod_M**

But without specific inputs, the final output state in the required format is:
Output State: **the final value of `s % M` after the loop executes all iterations.**
