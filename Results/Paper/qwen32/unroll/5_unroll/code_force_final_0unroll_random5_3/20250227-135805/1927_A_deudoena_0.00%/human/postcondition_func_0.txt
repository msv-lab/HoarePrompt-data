The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B'. It then calculates and prints the length of the string `s` minus the sum of the index of the first 'B' from the start and the index of the last 'B' from the end. However, the provided annotations and comments do not accurately describe the intended functionality, as the function seems to be incorrectly processing the input and does not handle multiple test cases as described.
