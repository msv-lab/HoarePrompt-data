You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in the strip is black.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `inpstr` is a string containing the first line of the input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases; `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr` or 0 if 'B' is not present; `ind2` is 0; `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `inpstr` is a string containing the first line of the input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases; `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr` or 0 if 'B' is not present; `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr` from the end or 0 if 'B' is not present; `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: length of `inpstr` (where `inpstr` is the string representation of the integer `t`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns the minimum number of groups of consecutive black cells ('B') in the strip for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
