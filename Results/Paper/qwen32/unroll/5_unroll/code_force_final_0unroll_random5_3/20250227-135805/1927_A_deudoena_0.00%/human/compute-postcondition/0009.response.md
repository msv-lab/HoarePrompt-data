Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns the minimum number of groups of consecutive black cells ('B') in the strip for each test case.**
