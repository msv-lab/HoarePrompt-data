The code snippet provided initializes the variable `ind1` to 0. This does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `ind1` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`inpstr` is a string containing the first line of the input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases; `ind1` is 0.**
