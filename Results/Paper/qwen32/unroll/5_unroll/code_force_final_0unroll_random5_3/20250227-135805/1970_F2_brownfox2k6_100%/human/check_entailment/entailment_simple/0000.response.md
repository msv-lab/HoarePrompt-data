### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`N` and `M`).
   - It then reads the field configuration, identifying positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - It initializes the score counters for both teams (`rs` for red and `bs` for blue) to zero.
   - It initializes a `carry` variable to keep track of which player (if any) is carrying the Quaffle.

2. **Processing Each Action:**
   - For each action, the program checks the type of action (`C` for catch, `T` for throw, and movement actions `U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - **Catch Action (`C`):** The program sets the `carry` variable to the player identifier.
   - **Throw Action (`T`):** The program resets the `carry` variable to `None` and checks the position of the Quaffle:
     - If the Quaffle is in a blue goal (`BG`), the red team scores (`rs` is incremented).
     - If the Quaffle is in a red goal (`RG`), the blue team scores (`bs` is incremented).
     - The Quaffle is then moved to the middle of the field.
   - **Movement Actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`):** The program calls `func_1` to update the position of the entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction.
     - **func_1:** This function correctly updates the coordinates of the entity based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - After updating the position of the entity, the program calls `func_2` to check if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger.
     - **func_2:** This function collects identifiers of players on the same cell as the Bludger, updates their positions to `[-1, -1]` (indicating they are eliminated), and prints the elimination event.

3. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all actions, the program prints the final score.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - The red player scores in the blue goal, resulting in "11 BLUE GOAL" and a final score of "FINAL SCORE: 0 1".
  - The program correctly handles this scenario.

- **Example 2:**
  - The red player scores in their own goal, resulting in "4 BLUE GOAL" and a final score of "FINAL SCORE: 0 1".
  - The program correctly handles this scenario.

- **Example 3:**
  - Both R0 and B0 are eliminated by the Bludger, resulting in "2 R0 ELIMINATED" and "4 B0 ELIMINATED", and a final score of "FINAL SCORE: 0 0".
  - The program correctly handles this scenario.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game rules and handles the provided examples accurately. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
