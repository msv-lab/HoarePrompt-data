Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes the positions of players and the Bludger on a field. It identifies players whose positions match the Bludger's position, sets their positions to `[-1, -1]`, and prints their identifiers along with the current time step and the message 'ELIMINATED'. The function modifies the `player` dictionary in place and does not return any value.**
