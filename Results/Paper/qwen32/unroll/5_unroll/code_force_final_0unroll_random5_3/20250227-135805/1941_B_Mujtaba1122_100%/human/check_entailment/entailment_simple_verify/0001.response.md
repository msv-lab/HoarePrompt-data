### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if we can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation that involves modifying three consecutive elements at a time. The operation can be applied repeatedly and involves:
- Decreasing \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
- Decreasing \( a_i \) by 2.
- Decreasing \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

#### Program Analysis

##### Function 1: `func_1`
This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It iterates through the array and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`. This function seems correct and does its job as intended.

##### Function 2: `func_2`
This function attempts to apply the described operation to make all elements zero. Here are the issues with this function:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - The operation should decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1, \( a_i \) by 2, and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.
   - However, the code incorrectly reduces \( a_{i+1} \) by \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \) by \( 2 \times a_{i-1} \), and \( a_{i-1} \) by \( a_{i-1} \).
   - This is a significant mistake because it does not follow the operation as described in the problem.

2. **Early Termination**:
   - The function prints "no" and returns as soon as it encounters a non-zero element after the first index, which is incorrect. It should continue processing the rest of the array.
   - This means the function might prematurely conclude that it's impossible to make all elements zero even if further operations could achieve that.

3. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The function does not ensure that the operation can be applied in a way that eventually makes all elements zero. It only checks if the operation can be applied repeatedly until \( a_i \le 1 \), which is not sufficient.
   - The logic should consider the overall feasibility of reducing all elements to zero, not just the local feasibility at each step.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The function prints "YES" or "NO" directly, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.
   - It should return a result that can be collected and printed later, especially when dealing with multiple test cases.

#### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not challenge the logic of the operations being performed. They only describe what the code does without validating if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect due to the following reasons:
1. It does not correctly implement the operation as specified.
2. It terminates early upon encountering a non-zero element, which is not the correct approach.
3. It does not ensure that all elements can be made zero through the described operations.
4. It handles output in a way that is not suitable for multiple test cases.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
