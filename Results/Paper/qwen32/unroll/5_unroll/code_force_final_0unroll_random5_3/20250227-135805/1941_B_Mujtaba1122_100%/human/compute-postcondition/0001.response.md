To understand the output state, let's analyze the loop and the conditions under which it operates.

The loop iterates over the elements of the list from the second element to the second-to-last element (i.e., `for i in range(1, n - 1)`). For each element at index `i`, the nested `while` loop continues to execute as long as the current element (`list[i]`), the previous element (`list[i - 1]`), and the next element (`list[i + 1]`) all have values greater than 0.

During each iteration of the `while` loop:
- `list[i + 1]` is decreased by `list[i - 1]`.
- `list[i]` is decreased by `2 * list[i - 1]`.
- `list[i - 1]` is decreased by `list[i - 1]` (which effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to 0).

After the `while` loop, if `list[i - 1]` is not 0, the program prints 'no' and exits.

Given these operations, the key points are:
- The `while` loop will continue to decrease the values of `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` while `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0.
- Once `list[i - 1]` becomes 0, the `while` loop stops for that iteration of `i`.
- If `list[i - 1]` is not 0 after the `while` loop (which would imply `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` were both greater than 0 but the loop didn't run enough to make `list[i - 1]` 0), the program will print 'no' and terminate.

Given these points, the only way the loop can complete without printing 'no' is if for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `list[i - 1]` becomes 0 before `list[i]` or `list[i + 1]` is depleted to the point where the `while` condition fails. This means that for each `i`, `list[i - 1]` must be able to be completely subtracted from `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` without depleting them completely (since `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` are decreased by `2 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` by `list[i - 1]` respectively).

If the loop completes, it means that the initial values in the list were such that the described operations could be performed without any `list[i - 1]` remaining non-zero after the `while` loop. This implies that the list will have been modified in such a way that all elements except possibly the first and last could have been reduced to 0, but the exact final values depend on the initial list configuration.

However, since the problem asks for the output state and doesn't specify the initial values, we can only describe the general state after the loop completes without printing 'no'. The list will generally have elements reduced based on the operations described, but without specific initial values, we can't determine the exact numerical values.

For the sake of this problem, we can assume the list will have been modified as per the operations, and the exact final state will depend on the initial values. However, if we consider the general case where the loop completes without printing 'no', the list will have been reduced in a specific manner.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:
Output State: **the list will have been modified such that elements from index 1 to n-2 may be reduced to 0 or some other values based on initial list configuration, and the first and last elements will remain unchanged unless they were part of the reduction operations.**

For a more concrete example, if the initial list was `[a, b, c, d, e]`, the output state could be something like `[a, 0, 0, 0, e]` if the operations reduced `b`, `c`, and `d` to 0, but this is just an example. The exact values depend on the initial list.

Given the problem constraints and the operations, the most general output state we can describe is:
Output State: **the list will have been modified such that elements from index 1 to n-2 may be reduced to 0 or some other values based on initial list configuration, and the first and last elements will remain unchanged unless they were part of the reduction operations.**
