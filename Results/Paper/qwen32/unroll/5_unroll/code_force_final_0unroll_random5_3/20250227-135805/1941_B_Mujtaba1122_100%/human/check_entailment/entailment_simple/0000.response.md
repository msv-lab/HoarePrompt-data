### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is supposed to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. Let's analyze the program step-by-step.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `lst` itself.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is called for each test case with the list `lst` and its length `n`.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive) and performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - The operation involves decreasing `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - If after the loop, `list[i-1]` is not zero for any `i` in the range, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - If the function `func_1` returns `True` (meaning all elements in the list are zero), it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list up to index `n-1` are zero.
   - It returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
   - The operation inside the while loop is incorrect. The operation should be reducing `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by `list[i-1]` times these values.
   - The current implementation can lead to negative values and incorrect results.

2. **Logic for Checking Zeros**:
   - The program checks if `list[i-1]` is zero after the loop, but this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero.
   - The program should ensure that all elements in the array are zero after the operations, not just the first `n-1` elements.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints "NO" and "YES" in lowercase, which is fine according to the problem description, but it should ensure that the logic is correct first.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the operation logic and the check for zeros, the program is not correct as it stands. It does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made zero using the specified operation.

**Correctness: False**
