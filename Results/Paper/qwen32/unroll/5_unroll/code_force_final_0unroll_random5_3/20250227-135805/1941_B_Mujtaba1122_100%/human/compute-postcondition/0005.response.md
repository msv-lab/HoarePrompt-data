The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state. The statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This means that regardless of the state of the list, the value of `n`, or the behavior of the function `func_1(list, n)`, the output will always be the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
