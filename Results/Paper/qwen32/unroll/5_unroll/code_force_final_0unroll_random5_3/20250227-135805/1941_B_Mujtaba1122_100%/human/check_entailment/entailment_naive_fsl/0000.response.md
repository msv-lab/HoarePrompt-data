Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the described operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The operation in the while loop is incorrect. The operation should be:
     * `list[i - 1] -= 1`
     * `list[i] -= 2`
     * `list[i + 1] -= 1`
   - However, the code incorrectly uses:
     * `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     * `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     * `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This means the operation is not correctly reducing the values as described in the problem statement.

2. **Logic for Checking Completion**:
   - The code uses `func_1` to check if all elements are zero after the operations. However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed, so this check is not reliable.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the initial values in the array make it impossible to perform the operations as described. For example, if the first or last element is non-zero and there are not enough operations to reduce them to zero, the code should return "NO".

4. **Example of Incorrect Behavior**:
   - Consider the input `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The correct sequence of operations should be:
     1. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
     2. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
     3. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
     4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - However, the provided code does not correctly perform these operations and will likely return "NO" for this input.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
