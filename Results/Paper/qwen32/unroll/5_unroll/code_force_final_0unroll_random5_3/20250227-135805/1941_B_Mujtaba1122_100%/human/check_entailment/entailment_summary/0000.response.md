Reasoning: 
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made entirely zero using the specified operations. The main issue lies in the way the operations are applied and the conditions checked.

The function `func_2` is supposed to simulate the operations described in the problem and then determine if the array can be made entirely zero. However, the current implementation of `func_2` has several problems:

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The operation described in the problem involves reducing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively whenever `i` (2 <= i <= n-1) is chosen. However, the current implementation incorrectly subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`, `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`. This is not the intended operation and will not correctly simulate the problem's rules.

2. **Condition Check**: The function checks if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the inner loop, but this check is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made entirely zero. It should check if all elements in the array are zero after attempting all possible operations.

3. **Output**: The function prints "NO" if `list[i - 1]` is not zero, which is not the correct approach. It should only print "YES" if all elements are zero after the operations, otherwise print "NO".

Given these issues, the current code does not correctly solve the problem and will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
