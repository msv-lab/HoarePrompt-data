The only variable in the loop head is `num`, and the iterable is `numbers[1:]`. To ensure the loop can execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements so that `numbers[1:]` is not empty. The state of `result` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted in terms of the loop's execution condition.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `result` is the first element of `numbers`**
