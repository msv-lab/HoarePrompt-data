Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but they are not used in any way to determine the bets for the game outcomes. The problem requires us to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome, which is not handled by the given code.

To solve the problem, we need to find a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min(k_i) \cdot x_i \]

One possible solution is to set:
\[ x_i = \left(\frac{\min(k_i) - 1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_j}}\right) \]

However, the provided code does not implement this logic or any other logic to find such a set of bets. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
