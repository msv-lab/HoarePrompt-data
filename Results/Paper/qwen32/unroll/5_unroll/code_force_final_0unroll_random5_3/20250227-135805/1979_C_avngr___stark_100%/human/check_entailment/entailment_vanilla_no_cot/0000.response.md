Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not contain a complete solution to the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, which is not directly related to solving the problem of distributing the coins as required.

To solve the problem, we need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. One possible approach is to use the multipliers to determine the bets. Specifically, we can set the bet for the i-th outcome to be the LCM of all multipliers divided by the i-th multiplier, ensuring that the total bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function to calculate LCM of two numbers
def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Function to calculate LCM of a list of numbers
def lcm_list(numbers):
    return reduce(lcm, numbers)

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        k = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        total_lcm = lcm_list(k)
        bets = [total_lcm // ki for ki in k]
        if sum(bets) < total_lcm:
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, bets)))
        else:
            results.append("-1")
    print("\n".join(results))

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# solve()
```

This code calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets. If the total bet is less than the LCM, it outputs the bets; otherwise, it outputs `-1`. This approach ensures that the conditions of the problem are met.
