You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to distribute coins across `n` possible outcomes such that if any one of these outcomes wins, the total amount received is strictly greater than the total amount bet. The received amount for each winning outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by a given multiplier `k_i`.

### Key Points:
1. **Total Bet**: Let the total amount bet be `B = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n`.
2. **Winning Condition**: For each outcome `i`, we need `k_i * x_i > B`.

### Approach:
To satisfy the winning condition for all outcomes, we need to find bets `x_i` such that:
\[ k_i * x_i > B \quad \forall i \]
\[ B = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \]

### Simplification:
One way to ensure this is by setting each `x_i` to a value that makes `k_i * x_i` significantly larger than `B`. One possible strategy is to set `x_i` to a value that leverages the least common multiple (LCM) of all `k_i` values.

### Strategy:
1. Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all `k_i` values.
2. Set each `x_i` to a fraction of the LCM divided by `k_i` to ensure the condition is met.

### Implementation:
The provided program includes two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
2. `func_2(numbers)`: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the program correctly implements the strategy:
- The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is computed.
- The bets `x_i` are set such that `x_i = LCM / k_i`.

This ensures that for each outcome `i`, `k_i * x_i = LCM`, which is strictly greater than `B` (the total bet) as long as `B < LCM`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the LCM and sets the bets `x_i` to ensure the winning condition is met for all outcomes. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
