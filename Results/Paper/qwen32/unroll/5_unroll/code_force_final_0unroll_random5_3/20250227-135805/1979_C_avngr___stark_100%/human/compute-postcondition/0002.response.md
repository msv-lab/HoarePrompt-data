To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1` and how it combines the elements of the list `numbers`. Since the function `func_1` is not provided, I'll assume a common operation such as addition to illustrate the process. If `func_1` were addition, the loop would sum all the elements of `numbers` starting with the first element as the initial `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `result` is the first element of `numbers`.

If `func_1` is addition, the loop would look like this:
```python
for num in numbers[1:]:
    result = result + num
```

This loop starts with `result` as the first element of `numbers` and iteratively adds each subsequent element of `numbers` to `result`.

Let's assume `numbers` is `[a, b, c, d]`. The initial state would be:
- `numbers = [a, b, c, d]`
- `result = a`

After the loop:
- First iteration: `result = a + b`
- Second iteration: `result = (a + b) + c`
- Third iteration: `result = ((a + b) + c) + d`

So, the final `result` would be `a + b + c + d`.

Output State: **`result` is the sum of all elements in `numbers`.**

If `func_1` were a different function, the final `result` would be determined by how `func_1` combines the elements. However, without knowing `func_1`, we can only provide a general description based on a common operation like addition.

Given the format requirement and assuming `func_1` is addition, the final output state is:

Output State: **`result` is the sum of all elements in `numbers`.**
