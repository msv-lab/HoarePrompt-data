Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns under a promotional pricing strategy. He can sell up to `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins down to `(b - k + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each.

### Key Steps to Maximize Profit
1. **Determine `k`:** The optimal `k` is the number of buns that should be sold at the promotional price. This value is constrained by the fact that `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n` and also cannot exceed `b - a` (since the price of the `k`-th bun in promotion should be at least `a`).
2. **Calculate Profit:** 
   - If `b <= a`, it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`, since the promotional price does not offer any benefit.
   - Otherwise, the profit from the first `k` buns sold at promotional prices is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`. The sum of this series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `S = (first_term + last_term) * number_of_terms / 2`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a` is simply `(n - k) * a`.

### Program Analysis
Let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determining `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This correctly limits `k` to the number of buns `n` and ensures that the promotional price does not go below the usual price `a`.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly outputs `a * n` (all buns sold at the usual price).
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the arithmetic series sum formula and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the promotional pricing strategy.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
