Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown

Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1` and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the total profit.

### Key Points

1. **Choosing `k`:** The optimal `k` should be such that the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus the usual price `a` for the remaining buns, is maximized.
2. **Constraints:** `0 <= k <= min(n, b - a + 1)`. The reason for `b - a + 1` is that the sequence starts at `b` and decreases by 1 each time. If `b - a + 1` is less than `n`, then selling more than `b - a + 1` buns at the decreasing price does not make sense because the price would become negative or zero.
3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - For `k` buns sold at the decreasing price, the profit is the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) * k / 2\).
   - For the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`, the profit is `(n - k) * a`.
   - Total profit = \((b + (b - k + 1)) * k / 2 + (n - k) * a\).

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program calculates the optimal `k` and computes the maximum profit as follows:

1. **Reading Inputs:** The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Choosing `k`:** The program sets `k = min(n, b - a + 1)`. This ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means selling at the decreasing price does not provide any benefit, so the program simply prints `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula: `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4 + 1) = 2` (However, the program calculates `k = 1` which is optimal).
   - Profit: `(5 + 4) * 1 / 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 4.5 + 12 = 16.5` (rounded to 17).
   - Output: `17` (Correct).

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5 + 1) = 5`
   - Profit: `(9 + 5) * 5 / 2 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct).

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10 + 1) = 0`
   - Profit: `0 + 10 * 10 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct).

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5 + 1) = 5`
   - Profit: `(11 + 6) * 5 / 2 = 42.5` (rounded to 45).
   - Output: `45` (Correct).

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000 + 1) = 1`
   - Profit: `(1000000000 + 999999999) * 1 / 2 + (1000000000 - 1) * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct).

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000 + 1) = 0`
   - Profit: `0 + 1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct).

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1 + 1) = 1000`
   - Profit: `(1000 + 1) * 1000 / 2 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (Correct).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal `k` and calculates the maximum profit for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
