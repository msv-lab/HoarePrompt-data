You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The variable t remains unchanged, and for each test case, the result of the expression is printed: if b <= a, a * n is printed; otherwise, (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a is printed, where k is the minimum of n and b - a.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it meets the problem description in every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob sells `n` buns, with the first `k` buns sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins, where `i` is the position of the bun (1-indexed), and the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a` coins. The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and computes the maximum profit for each case. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
3. If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not better than the usual price, so it simply prints `a * n`.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum profit using the formula:
   \[
   \text{profit} = \left(\frac{b + (b - k + 1)}{2}\right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
   \]

### Potential Issues
Let's consider the following points:
- **Case 1:** When `b <= a`, the program correctly returns `a * n` because selling at the usual price is better or the same.
- **Case 2:** When `b > a`, the program calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the point where the modified price becomes less than or equal to the usual price.
- **Formula:** The formula used for calculating the profit seems correct for the given conditions. It calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, and adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases:
1. **When `n = 1`:** The program should correctly handle this case.
2. **When `b = a`:** The program should return `a * n` because selling at the usual price is optimal.
3. **When `b < a`:** The program should return `a * n` because selling at the usual price is optimal.
4. **When `b - a > n`:** The program should set `k = n` and calculate the profit correctly.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program, it appears to handle all the described cases correctly. The logic for determining `k` and calculating the profit seems sound. There are no apparent edge cases or input scenarios that would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case by determining the optimal `k` and using the appropriate formula. It handles all edge cases, including when `b <= a` and when `b - a > n`.
