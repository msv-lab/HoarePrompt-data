You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element of the list equals zero. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem states that we have `n` containers of water, and the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. The goal is to determine if we can make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.

### Key Points:

1. **Equal Distribution**: Since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water for each container is `total_water / n`.
2. **Pouring Operation**: Water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

### Strategy:

To achieve the equal distribution, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference between the actual water in the containers and the target water level is zero by the end of the sequence. This is because the pouring operation can only move water from left to right, and the cumulative difference must balance out.

### Provided Program Analysis:

Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements the strategy:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program initializes `last` to the last element of the list and then calculates `curr` by summing up `i - last` for each `i` in `nums`. This does not correctly check the cumulative difference needed to balance the water levels.
2. **Misunderstanding the Target**: The program does not calculate the target water level (`total_water / n`) and does not check if the cumulative difference from the target is zero.
3. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `if i != 0` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct logic of the problem.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Calculate Target**: Compute the target water level `target = total_water / n`.
2. **Check Cumulative Difference**: Iterate through the list and maintain a running cumulative difference between the actual water and the target water. If the cumulative difference is zero by the end, it is possible to balance the water levels.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the water levels can be balanced. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
