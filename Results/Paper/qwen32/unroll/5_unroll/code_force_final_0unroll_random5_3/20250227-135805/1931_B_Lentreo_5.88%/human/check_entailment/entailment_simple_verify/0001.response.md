### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the given program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` containers with water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- The total amount of water is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

#### Key Insight:
- The target amount of water in each container is `target = total_water / n`.
- To achieve this, the cumulative difference between the actual water in the containers and the target water level must balance out as we move from left to right.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotations Recap:
- The program reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
- It sets `last` to the last element of `nums`.
- It initializes `curr` to 0.
- It iterates through `nums`, and for each element `i`, if `i` is not zero, it adds `i - last` to `curr`.
- Finally, it prints 'YES' if `curr == 0`, otherwise 'NO'.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program incorrectly calculates `curr` by summing `i - last` for each `i` in `nums`. This does not reflect the correct cumulative difference needed to balance the water levels.
2. **Misunderstanding the Target**: The program does not compute the target water level (`total_water / n`) and does not check if the cumulative difference from the target is zero.
3. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `if i != 0` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct logic of the problem.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate Target**: Compute the target water level `target = total_water / n`.
2. **Check Cumulative Difference**: Iterate through the list and maintain a running cumulative difference between the actual water and the target water. If the cumulative difference is zero by the end, it is possible to balance the water levels.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations indicate that the program incorrectly calculates `curr` by summing `i - last` for each `i` in `nums`.
- This means the program does not correctly determine if the cumulative difference balances out to zero, which is necessary for balancing the water levels.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the water levels can be balanced. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
