test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) such that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
