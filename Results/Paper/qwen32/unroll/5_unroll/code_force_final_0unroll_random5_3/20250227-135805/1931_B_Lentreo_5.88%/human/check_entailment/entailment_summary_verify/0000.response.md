### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The logic in the program does not align with the problem's requirements, specifically the constraint that water can only be poured from an earlier container to a later container (i.e., i < j).

Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks if the cumulative difference between each element and the last element is zero. This approach does not consider the directionality of the water pouring operation. The problem requires that water can only be moved from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

2. **Incorrect Test Case Analysis**: The original assessment provides a test case that demonstrates the flaw:
   - **Test Case**: `1 3 1 2 3`
   - **Expected Output**: `NO`
   - **Program Output**: `YES`
   - **Explanation**: The total amount of water is 6, which is divisible by 3, so the target is 2 units per container. However, it's impossible to redistribute the water to achieve this target using the allowed operation.

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sum of the array can be adjusted to match the target value for each container. This means that at each step, the cumulative water in the first `i` containers should not exceed `i * target`.

4. **Correct Program**: The corrected program provided in the assessment correctly implements this logic:
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           n = int(input())
           nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
           target = sum(nums) // n
           prefix_sum = 0
           can_balance = True
           for i in range(n):
               prefix_sum += nums[i]
               if prefix_sum > target * (i + 1):
                   can_balance = False
                   break
           print('YES' if can_balance else 'NO')
   ```

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program is incorrect based on the analysis. The original assessment accurately identifies the flaw and provides a corrected version of the program.

**Final: False**
