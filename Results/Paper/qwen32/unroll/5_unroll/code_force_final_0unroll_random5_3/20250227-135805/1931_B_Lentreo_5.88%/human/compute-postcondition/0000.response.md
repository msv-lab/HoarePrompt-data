Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints for the test cases remain unchanged.
