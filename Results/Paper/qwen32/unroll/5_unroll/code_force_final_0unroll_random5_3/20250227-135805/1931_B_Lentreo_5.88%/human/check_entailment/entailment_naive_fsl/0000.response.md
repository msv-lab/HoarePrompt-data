Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the issue:

The program attempts to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by checking if the cumulative difference between each element and the last element is zero. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the requirement that water can only be poured from an earlier container to a later container (i.e., i < j).

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the flaw:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The total amount of water is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is divisible by 3, so the target amount of water for each container is 2. However, it's impossible to redistribute the water such that each container has exactly 2 units of water using the allowed operation (pouring water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index).

**Program Output:**
The program would output "YES" for this test case, which is incorrect.

Here's why the program is incorrect:
- The program checks if the cumulative difference between each element and the last element is zero, which is not a valid check for the problem's requirements.
- The program does not simulate the process of pouring water from earlier containers to later containers to see if the target state can be achieved.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that at each step, we can pour water from earlier containers to later containers to reach the target amount of water in each container. The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sum of the array can be adjusted to match the target value for each container.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        prefix_sum = 0
        can_balance = True
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += nums[i]
            if prefix_sum > target * (i + 1):
                can_balance = False
                break
        print('YES' if can_balance else 'NO')

```

This corrected program correctly checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the same amount of water by ensuring that the prefix sum at each step does not exceed the expected cumulative sum for that point.
