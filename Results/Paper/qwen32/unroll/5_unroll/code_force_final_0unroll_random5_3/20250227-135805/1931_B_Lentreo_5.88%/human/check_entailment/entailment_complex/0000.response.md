Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program is flawed as it does not accurately determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The core idea of the problem is to check if we can redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount, which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers (n). The provided program, however, checks a different condition by calculating the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element, which does not address the redistribution problem correctly.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if we can make all elements equal to the average (total sum / n) by only pouring water from a container i to a container j where i < j. This can be determined by ensuring that at any point in the iteration, the cumulative sum of water in the first i containers is at least i times the average. If this condition holds, it means we can redistribute the water as required.

Correctness: **False**
