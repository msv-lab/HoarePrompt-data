### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes the first value as the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`).

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - It starts by creating a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Using this mapping, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding mapped character.

3. **Output**:
   - The decoded string for each test case is stored in the `results` list, which is then printed out.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Unique Characters and Sorting**:
  - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them to form `r`. This matches the problem description, which requires the distinct letters of the string `s` to be written in alphabetical order to form `r`.

- **Mapping Symmetric Characters**:
  - The program accurately maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart. This is done by iterating over the sorted list of unique characters and mapping the `i`-th character to the `(len_unique - 1 - i)`-th character. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on.

- **Decoding Process**:
  - The program applies this mapping to the encoded string `b` to produce the original string `s`. It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding mapped character from `char_map`. This matches the decoding process described in the problem statement.

### Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
  - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `encoded` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

- **State Inside `func_1`**:
  - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
  - `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse counterpart in the sorted list.
  - `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`.

- **State After `func_1`**:
  - The program returns a string `decoded` of length `n` where each character is the reverse counterpart of the corresponding character in `encoded` as per `char_map`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and produces the expected output for each test case.
