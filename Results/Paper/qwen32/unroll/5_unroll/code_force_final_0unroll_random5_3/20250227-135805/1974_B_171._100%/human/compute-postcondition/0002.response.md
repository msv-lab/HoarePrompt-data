The code snippet calculates the length of the `unique_chars` list and assigns it to the variable `len_unique`. 

Given that `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `encoded`, `len_unique` will hold the number of unique characters in `encoded`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `encoded`, and `unique_chars` remain unchanged. The `char_map` dictionary is still empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `encoded` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`.**
