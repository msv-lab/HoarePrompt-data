### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to decode a string `b` that was encoded by Polycarp's algorithm. The decoding process involves:

1. Extracting the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
2. Creating a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (first to last, second to second last, etc.).
3. Using this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r` to form the original string `s`.

The provided program follows these steps correctly:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
2. It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.
3. Inside `func_1`, it:
   - Extracts the unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form `unique_chars`.
   - Creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.
   - Constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

The decoding process is correctly implemented, and the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
