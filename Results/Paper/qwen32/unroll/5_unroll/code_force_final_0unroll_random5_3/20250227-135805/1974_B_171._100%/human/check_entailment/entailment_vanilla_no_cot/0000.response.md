Correctness: **False**

The provided program actually performs the encoding operation instead of the decoding operation as required by the problem statement. The function `func_1` maps each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters, which is the encoding process, not the decoding process.

To correct the program, the function `func_1` should map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding original character using the reverse mapping. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]  # Reverse mapping for decoding
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

With this correction, the program will correctly decode the encoded string back to the original string.
