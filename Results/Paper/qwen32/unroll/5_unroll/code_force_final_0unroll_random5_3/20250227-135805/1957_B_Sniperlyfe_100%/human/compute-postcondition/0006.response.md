Output State: **The program returns the list `nums` where the first element is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1 + k` and the subsequent elements are either `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` if `k` is smaller than `nums[0] + 1`.**

This means the list starts with a specific calculated value based on `k`, and the rest of the list is filled with either the next integer or the remaining value of `k` if it is smaller than the next integer.
