Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. The logic used in the program is incorrect. The program simply checks if the sum of coins in both wallets is even or odd and determines the winner based on that, which does not align with the optimal strategy described in the problem.

The optimal strategy for this game can be deduced as follows:
- If both players play optimally, they will always try to force the opponent into a losing position.
- If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (a == b), Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move, hence Bob wins.
- If the number of coins in both wallets is different (a != b), Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that Bob is always left with a situation where the number of coins in both wallets is the same on his turn.

Thus, the correct logic should be:
- If a == b, Bob wins.
- If a != b, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This program correctly implements the optimal strategy and will produce the correct output for all test cases.
