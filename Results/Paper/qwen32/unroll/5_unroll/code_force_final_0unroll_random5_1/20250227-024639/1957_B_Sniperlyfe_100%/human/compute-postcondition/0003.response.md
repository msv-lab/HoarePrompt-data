In the provided for loop, the loop variable `i` iterates over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the range limit `n`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 1, since if `n` is 1 or less, the range `(1, n)` would be empty and the loop would not execute.

Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`. This means `n` could be 1, in which case the loop wouldn't execute. To guarantee the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure `n` is at least 2.

The other variables `t`, `k`, and `nums` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The value of `k` is updated after the loop starts, and `nums` is initialized in a specific way, but these do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are zeros**
