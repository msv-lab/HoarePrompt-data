Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x`, `y` <= `n` and `x` != `y`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which represents the number of test cases. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x`, `y`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are yet to be defined or input.
