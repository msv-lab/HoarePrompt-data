The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `index` to 1. This means that the variable `index` is now set to 1, while the other variables (`t` and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, where the first element is `t` (the number of test cases), and the subsequent elements are the interleaved values of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is 1.**
