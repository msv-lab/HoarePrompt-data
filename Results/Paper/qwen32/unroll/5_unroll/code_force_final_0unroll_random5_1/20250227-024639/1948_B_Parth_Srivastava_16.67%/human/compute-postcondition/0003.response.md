The variable `x` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0.**
