Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here is a specific case that demonstrates an issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
9 11 10
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The array `[9, 11, 10]` can be transformed into `[9, 1, 1, 1, 0]` by splitting `11` into `1` and `1`, and `10` into `1` and `0`. The resulting array `[9, 1, 1, 1, 0]` can be rearranged to `[0, 1, 1, 1, 9]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `NO` for this test case because it does not correctly handle the logic for splitting numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.

**Issue in the Code:**
The code does not correctly implement the logic to handle the splitting of numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. Specifically, the code does not properly handle the insertion of split digits and does not check all possible ways to split numbers to see if the array can be sorted.

**Specific Code Issues:**
1. The code does not correctly insert the digits of numbers greater than 10 into the list `c`.
2. The code does not correctly check if the resulting array can be sorted after all possible splits.

To fix the program, a more robust approach is needed to handle the splitting of numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. This might involve recursively splitting numbers and checking all possible configurations.
