Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program does not perform any operations on the input array `a` to maximize the sum. Instead, it simply checks the length of the array and prints hardcoded values for the sum and number of operations, without considering the actual values in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program reads the input values but does not convert the string elements of `na` to integers, which would be necessary for any calculations or comparisons.
2. The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array is 2, printing a fixed output of `4 1` and `1 2`, which is only correct for the specific case of the array `[0, 1]`. For all other cases, it prints `13 0`, which is not a general solution and is only correct for the specific example `[1, 3, 9]`.
3. The program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX of any subarray or to perform the operations as described in the problem statement. It does not attempt to maximize the sum of the array based on the given rules.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible input cases.

Correctness: **False**
