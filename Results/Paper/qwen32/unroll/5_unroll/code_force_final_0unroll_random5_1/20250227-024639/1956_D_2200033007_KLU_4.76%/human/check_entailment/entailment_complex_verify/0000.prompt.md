You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

    1
    
    0

Output

    1 1
    1 1
    
Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Annotated Code: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of integers where 1 <= len(c) <= 18 and 0 <= c[i] <= 10^7 for each i in the range of the length of c.
def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: `c` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(c) <= 18 and 0 <= c[i] <= 10^7 for each i in the range of the length of c. If `c` is a list containing a single integer 2, then `m` remains 0. Otherwise, `m` remains 0 and `c` is not equal to 2.
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `c` with a length between 1 and 18, where each integer is between 0 and 10^7. It prints specific lines based on whether the list `c` is exactly `[2]` or not. If `c` is `[2]`, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2". Otherwise, it prints "13 0". The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation. The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and outputs fixed results without considering the actual values in the array or performing any operations.

Let's analyze the program with the examples provided in the problem description:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `2\n0 1`
   - Expected Output: `4 1\n1 2`
   - Actual Output: `4 1` (since the length of the array is 2, the program outputs `4 1` without performing any operations)

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `3\n1 3 9`
   - Expected Output: `13 0`
   - Actual Output: `13 0` (since the length of the array is not 2, the program outputs `13 0` without performing any operations)

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`
   - Actual Output: `13 0` (since the length of the array is not 2, the program outputs `13 0` without performing any operations)

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `1\n0`
   - Expected Output: `1 1\n1 1`
   - Actual Output: `13 0` (since the length of the array is not 2, the program outputs `13 0` without performing any operations)

The program does not perform any operations on the array and does not calculate the MEX value for any subarray. It simply outputs predefined results based on the length of the array, which is incorrect for all cases except the first example where the length is 2. For all other cases, the program fails to compute the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
