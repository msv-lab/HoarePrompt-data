Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b`. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues:

- The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then for each test case, it reads three integers: `a` (the price of one yogurt), `b` (the price of two yogurts), and `c` (which seems to be a misinterpretation of `b` in the code).
- It calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is incorrect because `c` is not defined in the problem description. It should be `b / 2` if we assume `c` is a typo for `b`.
- The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. It should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the single yogurt price (`a * n`) with the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price (`b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:
- Suppose `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`.
- The correct minimum cost would be `9 + 5 = 14` (buy two yogurts for 9 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles).
- However, the given program calculates `d` as `9 / 2 = 4.5` and then compares `5 * 3 = 15` with `5 * 4.5 = 22.5` which is incorrect and leads to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        cost_single = a * n
        cost_pairs = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
        print(min(cost_single, cost_pairs))

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the cost of buying yogurts in pairs and compares it with the cost of buying them individually to determine the minimum cost.
