Reasoning:

The function provided is intended to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the price of one yogurt `a` and the price for two yogurts `b`. However, there are several issues in the given code that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The function reads `n` as the number of test cases, but then it tries to read `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This is incorrect because the problem description specifies that for each test case, there are three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (not `a`, `b`, and `c`). The variable `c` does not exist according to the problem description. Instead, `b` is the price for two yogurts.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function calculates `d` as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the context of the problem. It should be using `b` (the price for two yogurts) instead. Furthermore, the logic for determining the minimum cost is flawed. The comparison `a * b < a * d` does not make sense because `b` and `d` are not directly comparable in this context. Instead, the program should compare the cost of buying yogurts in pairs (`b`) versus buying them individually (`a`).

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic to determine the minimum cost should be based on the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotional price and the remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price. Specifically, the cost should be calculated as:
   - `(n // 2) * b` for the pairs of yogurts.
   - `(n % 2) * a` for the remaining yogurt, if any.

4. **Incorrect Print Statement**: The print statement should output the total minimum cost calculated for each test case, not the comparison of `a * b` and `round(a * d)`.

Given these issues, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
