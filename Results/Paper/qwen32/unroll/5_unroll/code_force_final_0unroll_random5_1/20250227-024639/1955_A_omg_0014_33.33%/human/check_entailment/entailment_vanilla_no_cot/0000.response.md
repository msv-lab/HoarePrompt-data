Correctness: **False**

The given program contains a few logical errors. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Variable Mapping Issue**: The program expects the input to be in the order `(a, b, c)`, but the problem description specifies the input should be `(n, a, b)`. Here, `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price for one yogurt, and `b` is the price for two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the context. Instead, it should use `b / 2` if it were to calculate the price per yogurt under promotion, but this is not needed for the correct logic.

3. **Comparison Logic Issue**: The logic to determine the minimum cost is incorrect. The program compares `a * b` (which is incorrect as `b` is the price for two yogurts) with `a * d` (which is also incorrect). Instead, the logic should determine the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and handle the remaining yogurts if any.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the minimum cost by considering the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and handles any remaining yogurts individually.
