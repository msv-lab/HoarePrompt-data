### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.

However, there are a few issues in the code that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Variable Misuse**:
   - The input variables are `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts.
   - In the code, it mistakenly uses `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`, which implies there are three distinct inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`. The correct variables should be `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - Furthermore, `d = c / 2` is incorrect. The variable `d` should not be calculated as `c / 2`. Instead, the logic should compare `n` yogurts bought at the single yogurt price versus the promotional price.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The logic to determine the minimum cost is flawed. The program should calculate the cost based on how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotional price and how many yogurts are left to buy at the regular price.
   - Specifically, the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotional price is `n // 2`, and the remaining yogurts (if any) are `n % 2`. The total cost should be `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program incorrectly compares `a * b` with `a * d` and prints the minimum of these two values. This comparison does not correctly represent the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
