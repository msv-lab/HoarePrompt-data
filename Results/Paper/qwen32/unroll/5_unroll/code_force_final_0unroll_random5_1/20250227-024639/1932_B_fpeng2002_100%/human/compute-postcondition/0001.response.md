The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000). Since the problem specifies that `num_tests` is within the range 1 to 1000, `num_tests` is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed as the loop will certainly execute at least once.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000)**
