You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; n is the integer value provided by the input; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99. The output for each test case is printed as either "YES" or "NO" based on the condition inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the list can be modified by repeatedly replacing a pair of adjacent elements with a new list formed by concatenating the digits of the larger element followed by the smaller element, such that the resulting list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If this condition can be met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of the array and the array itself. The goal is to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly breaking down any number that is at least 10 into its individual digits.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning on the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The program initializes `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted by the given operations.

3. **Iterating Backwards**: The program iterates through the array from the last element to the second element (i.e., from `m-1` to `1`). This is a reasonable approach because it allows the program to check if the current element is less than the previous one, which is a necessary condition for the array not being sorted.

4. **Checking Condition**: If an element `arr[i]` is found to be less than `arr[i-1]`, the program attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting array (with `arr[i]` appended) can be sorted. If the resulting array cannot be sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.

5. **Updating Array**: If the array can be sorted by splitting `arr[i-1]`, the program updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number. However, this step does not affect the overall logic of checking if the array can be sorted, as the check is done on the hypothetical new array `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`.

6. **Output**: Based on the value of `ans`, the program prints "YES" if the array can be sorted and "NO" otherwise.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program only checks if the immediate preceding element can be split to make the current element not less than it. It does not consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements or the effect of splitting on elements further back in the array. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will check if `5` can be made not less than `28` by splitting `28`, which it cannot. However, it should also consider splitting `12` to `[1, 2]` and then checking if the array `[1, 2, 28, 5]` can be sorted, which it can by further splitting `28`.

Thus, the program's logic is incomplete and incorrect.
