Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the specified operations. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in how it handles the splitting of numbers and checking if the array can be sorted.

Here are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**:
   - The program attempts to split a number and check if the resulting array (including the next number) is sorted. However, this does not consider all possible splits and rearrangements.
   - It only checks a specific case where it splits a number and immediately compares the resulting list with the next number, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - The program takes a greedy approach by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning and checking if a split can make the array sorted. However, this approach does not account for all possible splits and rearrangements that might be needed to sort the array.

3. **No Consideration for Multiple Splits**:
   - The program only considers splitting a number and checking the immediate effect on the next number. It does not consider scenarios where multiple splits might be needed or where splits should be done in a different order to achieve a sorted array.

To correctly solve this problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as:

- Iteratively checking if the array is sorted.
- If not sorted, identify the first pair of elements that are out of order.
- Attempt to split the larger element and check if it can help in sorting the array.
- Repeat the process until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is not possible.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect, and Correctness is **False**.
