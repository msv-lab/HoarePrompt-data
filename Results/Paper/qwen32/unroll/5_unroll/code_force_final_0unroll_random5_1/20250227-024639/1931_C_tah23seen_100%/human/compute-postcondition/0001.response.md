Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The function is called once for each test case, and the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `i` is 0. `n` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to be the length of the list `arr`. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
