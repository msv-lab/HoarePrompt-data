Precondition: **number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers representing the array to be found, with all elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. However, in this problem, the sequence is not provided as input; it is the output that needs to be determined based on the given number. The function definition provided does not match the problem description, as the function should take an integer X and return the length of the array and the array itself.**
