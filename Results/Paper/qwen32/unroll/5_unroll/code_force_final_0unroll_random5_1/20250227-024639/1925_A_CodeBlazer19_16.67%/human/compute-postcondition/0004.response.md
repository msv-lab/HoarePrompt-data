Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a string `s` of length `k` using the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. Otherwise, it prints the string `s` repeated either once or twice, depending on whether `n` is 1 or greater than 1.**
