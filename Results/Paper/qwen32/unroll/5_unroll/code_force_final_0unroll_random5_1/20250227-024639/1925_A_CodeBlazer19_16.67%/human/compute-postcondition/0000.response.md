Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the integer input, which is within the range of 1 to 676. The conditions for `n` and `k` in the test cases remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input statement.
