You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as per the given description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that each sub-problem has a positive integer difficulty and their sum equals `x`.
- The goal is to maximize the balance, which is the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which represents the integer division of `x` by `n`.
   - If `k == 1`, it means that the smallest possible difficulty for each sub-problem is 1, and the GCD can only be 1. Hence, it prints `1` and continues to the next test case.

3. **Finding the Maximum Balance:**
   - If `k > 1`, the program searches for the maximum possible GCD.
   - It iterates through potential divisors `i` of `x` starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` up to the square root of `x`, incrementing by 2 (to check only odd numbers after 1).
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`:
     - It checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`.
     - If they are, it considers them as potential candidates for the maximum balance.
     - It keeps track of the maximum value found among these candidates.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the case when `k == 1` by directly outputting `1`.
- For `k > 1`, it attempts to find the largest divisor `i` of `x` such that both `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`. This is because the GCD of the sub-problem difficulties must be a divisor of `x` and must be achievable by splitting `x` into `n` parts, each having a difficulty of at least 1 and at most `k`.
- The iteration through potential divisors ensures that the program considers all possible valid GCD values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum balance for each test case. It efficiently checks for the largest possible GCD that can be achieved with the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
