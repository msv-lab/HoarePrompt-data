You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)

                    l.append(x // i)

        print(ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x`.
- **Balance:** The balance of the problemset is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
- **Goal:** Maximize the balance.

### Program Analysis:
The given program tries to find the maximum balance by iterating through possible divisors of `x` up to its square root. It checks if these divisors can be used as difficulties for the sub-problems and keeps track of the maximum valid divisor found.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Small `x` and `n`:** The program handles the case where `k == 1` (i.e., `x // n == 1`) by directly printing `1`. This is correct because if each sub-problem must have a difficulty of at least `1`, then the maximum balance is `1` when `x // n == 1`.
2. **Iterating Over Divisors:** The program iterates over odd divisors starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` up to the square root of `x`. This seems correct for finding divisors.
3. **Checking Divisors:** The program checks if the divisor `i` and its complement `x // i` are less than or equal to `k` (i.e., `x // n`). This ensures that the sub-problems' difficulties do not exceed the average difficulty `k`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input:** `10 3`
   - **Output:** `2`
   - **Explanation:** Possible sub-problems with difficulties `4, 2, 4` have a GCD of `2`.
2. **Input:** `5 5`
   - **Output:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** Each sub-problem must have a difficulty of `1`, giving a GCD of `1`.
3. **Input:** `420 69`
   - **Output:** `6`
   - **Explanation:** Possible sub-problems with difficulties summing to `420` and having a GCD of `6`.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **Input:** `1 1`
   - **Output:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** Only one sub-problem with difficulty `1`.
2. **Input:** `2 2`
   - **Output:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** Two sub-problems with difficulties `1, 1`.
3. **Input:** `100 10`
   - **Output:** `10`
   - **Explanation:** Ten sub-problems with difficulties `10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10` have a GCD of `10`.
4. **Input:** `27 3`
   - **Output:** `9`
   - **Explanation:** Three sub-problems with difficulties `9, 9, 9` have a GCD of `9`.

### Conclusion:
After testing the program with the provided examples and additional edge cases, the program seems to correctly compute the maximum balance for all tested cases. It adheres to the problem's requirements and correctly handles various scenarios.

**Correctness:** **True**

Explanation: The program correctly finds the maximum balance by iterating through possible divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used as difficulties for the sub-problems. It handles edge cases and provides the correct output for all tested scenarios.
