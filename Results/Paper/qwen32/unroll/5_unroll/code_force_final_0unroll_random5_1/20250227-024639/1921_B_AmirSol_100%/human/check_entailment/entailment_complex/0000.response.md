### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cat placements `s1` into the desired state `s2`. The operations allowed are adding a cat, removing a cat, and moving a cat from one box to another.

The key insight is that:
- Adding a cat to a box where there isn't one (`s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`) is necessary.
- Removing a cat from a box where there is one (`s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`) is necessary.
- Moving a cat from one box to another can be seen as a combination of removing a cat from one box and adding it to another.

The number of operations required is determined by the maximum of the number of cats that need to be added and the number of cats that need to be removed. This is because:
- If more cats need to be added than removed, the limiting factor is the number of cats to add, as each addition can be paired with a removal (if there are any) or done independently.
- Conversely, if more cats need to be removed than added, the limiting factor is the number of cats to remove, as each removal can be paired with an addition (if there are any) or done independently.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`), and returns the maximum of these two values.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

**Correctness: True**
