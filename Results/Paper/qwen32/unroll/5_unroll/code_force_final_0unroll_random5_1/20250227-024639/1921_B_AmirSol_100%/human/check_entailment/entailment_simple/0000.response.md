### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). The operations allowed are adding a cat, removing a cat, and moving a cat from one box to another.

Let's analyze the provided solution:

1. **Count Cats to Add (`cats_to_add`)**: This is the number of boxes in the desired state (`s2`) that have a cat (`'1'`) but do not have a cat in the initial state (`s1`).

2. **Count Cats to Remove (`cats_to_remove`)**: This is the number of boxes in the initial state (`s1`) that have a cat (`'1'`) but do not have a cat in the desired state (`s2`).

3. **Determine the Minimum Operations**: The key insight here is that the number of operations required is the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is because:
   - If `cats_to_add` is greater, we need to add more cats than we need to remove, so the limiting factor is the number of cats we need to add.
   - If `cats_to_remove` is greater, we need to remove more cats than we need to add, so the limiting factor is the number of cats we need to remove.
   - If they are equal, we can balance the additions and removals perfectly, and the number of operations is simply the value of either `cats_to_add` or `cats_to_remove`.

The provided code correctly calculates `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` and then returns the maximum of the two, which is the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations required.
