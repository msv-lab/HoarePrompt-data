Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2`. The logic is based on the observation that the number of cats to add and the number of cats to remove are the two main operations that need to be considered. Since moving a cat from one box to another can be thought of as a combination of removing a cat from one box and adding a cat to another, the overall minimum number of operations is determined by the larger of these two counts (`cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`). This is because each removal or addition can be paired with a corresponding move if needed, but if there are more additions than removals (or vice versa), the extra operations will be the limiting factor. Thus, the program correctly returns `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)` for each test case.
