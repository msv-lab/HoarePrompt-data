You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: A sequence of integers printed based on the conditions described in the code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an integer `k`, along with an array `a` of length `2n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice. For each test case, it prints a sequence of integers based on specific conditions related to the counts of elements in the first and second halves of the array. The function ensures that exactly `k` pairs or single elements are printed from the first half, and then prints the remaining elements to balance the counts from the second half if necessary.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Given an array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice, find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that:
- `l` is a subset of the first half of `a`.
- `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`.
- The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
    - Two arrays `l` and `r` of size `n` are initialized to count occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
    - The program iterates over the first half of `a` to populate `l` and the second half to populate `r`.

3. **Constructing `l`:**
    - It first tries to add pairs of identical numbers from the first half to `l` until it reaches the required length `2k`.
    - If it reaches `2k` elements in `l`, it breaks the loop.

4. **Constructing `r`:**
    - If `l` does not yet have `2k` elements, it adds unique numbers from the first half of `a` to `l` until the total length of `l` is `2k`.
    - It also stores these unique numbers in a list `res`.

5. **Constructing `r` (continued):**
    - It prints the elements of `l` (which is a subset of the first half of `a`).
    - It then prints the elements of `res` to form the beginning of `r`.
    - If `l` and `r` do not yet have the same number of pairs of identical numbers, it adds pairs of identical numbers from the second half of `a` to `r` until the number of pairs of identical numbers in `l` and `r` match.

6. **Output:**
    - The program outputs `l` and `r` on two separate lines.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` are equal.
- The logic for constructing `r` is flawed. It only adds pairs of identical numbers from the second half of `a` until the number of pairs of identical numbers in `l` and `r` match, which does not guarantee that the XORs of `l` and `r` are equal.
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than the number of pairs of identical numbers in the first half of `a` correctly.
- The program does not guarantee that `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` are equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
