You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates the sum of every second element from the sorted list of integers for each test case and prints these sums.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Provided Program Analysis

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score by optimally performing the described moves. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`n`), and then the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting and Calculation:**
   - The list of integers is sorted.
   - The program then takes every second element starting from the first (i.e., `list1[0], list1[2], list1[4], ...`), which are the smallest elements in each pair after sorting.
   - It sums these elements to get the maximum score for that test case.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the score for each test case.

### Correctness Verification

The key to solving this problem optimally is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. By sorting the list and summing every second element starting from the first, the program ensures that the smallest numbers are paired, thereby maximizing the sum of the minimums of each pair.

Let's check if the program handles all potential cases correctly:

- **Sorting:** The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
- **Pairing:** By taking every second element after sorting, the program effectively pairs the smallest numbers together.
- **Edge Cases:** 
  - **Single Pair:** If `n=1`, the program correctly takes the smaller of the two numbers.
  - **All Identical Numbers:** If all numbers are identical, the program correctly sums `n` of those numbers.
  - **Different Numbers:** The program correctly pairs the smallest numbers together, ensuring the maximum score.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the provided code, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The logic of sorting the list and summing every second element after sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly sorts the list of integers and sums every second element after sorting, ensuring that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is the optimal strategy for maximizing the score. The code handles multiple test cases and various input scenarios correctly.
