The code snippet `num = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. Since the input is read as a string, `num` will hold a string value. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the list of integers `a` contains 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7; `num` is a string input by the user.**
