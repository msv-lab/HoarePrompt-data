#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters. It seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete function snippet. Therefore, no precondition can be derived based on the provided function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(putin())
    #The program returns the integer value of whatever `putin()` returns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value of whatever `putin()` returns.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2()`.
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers converted from the split string obtained by `putin().split()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from `putin()`, splits the input string into substrings, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar and sec_arr are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. Specifically, main_ar contains tuples (a_i, b_i) representing the prices for Alice and Bob for each item, and sec_arr is a list of tuples (a_i, b_i) that is used to calculate an initial sum.
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
        
    #State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers; `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers; `sub_summ` is 94.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns 94.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers. It calculates a sum by adding the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and then adds the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` if their sum is non-negative. The function returns the calculated sum, which is always 94 in this case.
