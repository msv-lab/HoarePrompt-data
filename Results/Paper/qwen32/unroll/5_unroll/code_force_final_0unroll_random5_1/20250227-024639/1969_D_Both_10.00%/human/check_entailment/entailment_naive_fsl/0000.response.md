Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The given code is incomplete and does not handle the logic required to determine Alice's optimal profit. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Functions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` rely on a non-defined function `putin()`, which should presumably be `input()`. However, these functions are not used in the main logic of the program.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's profit. It simply sums up the values from `sec_arr` and adds a conditional sum from `main_ar` based on a condition that does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Lack of Test Case Handling**: The code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It does not iterate over the number of test cases `t` and process each test case accordingly.

4. **Optimization Strategy**: The code does not use an optimal strategy to maximize Alice's profit. It should consider sorting the items based on the difference between Bob's and Alice's prices and then apply the rules for selecting and selling items.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
def main():
    import sys
    import heapq
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        b = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        items = [(a[i], b[i], b[i] - a[i]) for i in range(n)]
        items.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
        
        profit = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i < k:
                profit -= a[i]
            else:
                profit += max(0, b[i] - a[i])
        
        results.append(profit)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads input, processes each test case, and calculates Alice's profit by sorting items based on the difference between Bob's and Alice's prices and applying the rules described in the problem statement.
