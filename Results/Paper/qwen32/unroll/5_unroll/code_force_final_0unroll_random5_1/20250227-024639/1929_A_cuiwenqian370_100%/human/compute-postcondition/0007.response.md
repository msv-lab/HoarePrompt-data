In the given task, the for loop iterates over `results`. The only variable in the loop head is `result`, so we can only adjust the state of `results` to ensure that the loop can execute.

To make the loop execute, `results` must be a collection (like a list) that contains at least one element. Hereâ€™s how we can adjust the state:

1. `results` must have at least one element.
2. `result` will be the first element of `results` during the first iteration.

Given the initial state description, `results` contains the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration. This means `results` should be a list of results from previous iterations.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`array` is the last array processed in the final iteration of the loop, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `index` is the position after the last processed part of `data`, `results` is a list containing at least one element, which is the result of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, and `result` is the first element of `results`**. 

Since we are only concerned with the state of `results` for the loop to execute, the final adjusted state can be simplified to:

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element**.
