To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic in relation to the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the elements in any way. To maximize this beauty, Sasha should arrange the elements in either ascending or descending order. This is because the maximum absolute difference between any two numbers is achieved when they are as far apart as possible.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Calculating Beauty**: It then calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, the differences are non-negative, and taking the absolute value is unnecessary.
3. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Verification:
- The logic of sorting the array to maximize the beauty is correct.
- The program handles multiple test cases as described.
- The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It sorts the array to maximize the beauty and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

### Your Response:
Correctness: **True**
