The provided code snippet assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This does not affect the initial state of `array` or any other variables mentioned. The `input` variable now holds a reference to the `sys.stdin.read` function, which can be used to read from standard input.

Output State: **array is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100 and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`**.
