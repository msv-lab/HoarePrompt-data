### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over the array `a` from the end to the beginning, calculating the permutation `p` based on the `MEX` (minimum excludant) concept. However, there are some issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program initializes `mex` to `n` and updates it only by taking the minimum of the current `mex` and the calculated `p[i]`. This does not correctly determine the `MEX` of the current subset of `p`. The `MEX` should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the current subset of `p`.

2. **Backward Iteration**: The program iterates from the end of the array `a` to the beginning, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach is to iterate from the beginning of `a` to the end while maintaining a set or list to track the used numbers and determine the `MEX` at each step.

3. **Handling Negative Values**: The program does not handle the case where the calculated `p[i]` could be negative or already used, which is a potential issue given the constraints.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly compute the permutation `p` for the given array `a`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
