Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The issue lies in the way the MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) is being calculated and used to determine the values of \( p \).

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program initializes `mex` to `n` and iterates from the end of the array \( a \) to the beginning.
2. For each position \( i \), it calculates \( p[i] \) as `mex - a[i]` and then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

This approach does not correctly ensure that the MEX at each step is the smallest non-negative integer not already in the constructed part of \( p \). The MEX should be recalculated based on the current state of \( p \) up to that point, not just based on the previous `mex` value.

A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used numbers and recalculating the MEX at each step based on this set. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
        print(*p)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- A set `used` is maintained to keep track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation \( p \).
- For each position \( i \), the MEX is recalculated by finding the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
- The value of \( p[i] \) is then set to `mex - a[i]`, and `p[i]` is added to the `used` set.

This ensures that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies the conditions given by the array \( a \).
