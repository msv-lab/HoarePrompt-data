Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be an integer input by the user, while the other variables (`n`, `a`) remain as described in the initial state.
