Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to evaluate whether the program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX (minimum excludant) of a list is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Initializes an array \( p \) of length \( n \) with -1.
2. Sets the initial MEX value to \( n \).
3. Iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order:
   - For each element \( a[i] \), it calculates \( p[i] = \text{MEX} - a[i] \).
   - Updates the MEX value to be the minimum of the current MEX and \( p[i] \).
4. Prints the constructed permutation \( p \).

### Function Summary:
The summary states that the function reads multiple test cases and computes a permutation \( p \) for each test case based on the array \( a \).

### Evaluation:
Let's consider the logic of the program in detail:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The array \( p \) is initialized with -1, which is fine as this will be overwritten.
   - The initial MEX value is set to \( n \), which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the range [0, n-1].

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order. This is crucial because the MEX of the prefix \( p[1..i] \) should be correctly determined before calculating \( p[i] \).
   - For each element \( a[i] \), it calculates \( p[i] = \text{MEX} - a[i] \). This formula is derived from the problem statement \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), rearranged to find \( p_i \).

3. **MEX Update**:
   - After calculating \( p[i] \), the MEX is updated to be the minimum of the current MEX and \( p[i] \). This ensures that the MEX value reflects the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation \( p \).

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**First Test Case**:
- Input: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
- Reverse Iteration:
  - \( i = 4 \): \( p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3 \), MEX = min(5, 3) = 3
  - \( i = 3 \): \( p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), MEX = min(3, 2) = 2
  - \( i = 2 \): \( p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4 \), MEX = min(2, 4) = 2
  - \( i = 1 \): \( p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1 \), MEX = min(2, 1) = 1
  - \( i = 0 \): \( p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0 \), MEX = min(1, 0) = 0
- Output: \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \)

This output matches the example given in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) by iterating in reverse and updating the MEX value appropriately. The approach ensures that the MEX value is correctly maintained and the permutation \( p \) satisfies the given condition.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **True**
