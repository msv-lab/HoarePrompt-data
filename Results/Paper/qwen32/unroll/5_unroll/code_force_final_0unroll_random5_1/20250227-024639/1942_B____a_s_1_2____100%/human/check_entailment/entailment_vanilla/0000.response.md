Reasoning:

The given program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) based on the provided problem description. Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - It initializes the permutation array \( p \) with -1.
   - It sets the initial MEX value to \( n \).

3. **Iterative Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element \( a[i] \), it calculates the corresponding \( p[i] \) using the formula \( p[i] = \text{MEX} - a[i] \).
   - It then updates the MEX value to be the minimum of the current MEX and \( p[i] \).

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation \( p \) for the current test case, it prints the permutation.

### Analysis of the Approach:

- The program is attempting to construct the permutation \( p \) by working backwards from the array \( a \). This approach is valid because the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation \( p \) exists for the given array \( a \).

- The key point here is the correct calculation of the MEX value. The MEX value is updated to be the minimum of the current MEX and the newly calculated \( p[i] \). This ensures that the MEX value is always the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been used in the permutation \( p \).

- The program iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order to ensure that the MEX value is correctly calculated for each element of \( p \). This is because the MEX value depends on the elements of \( p \) that have already been calculated.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) using the given approach. Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation \( p \) exists, the program will always produce a valid permutation.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
