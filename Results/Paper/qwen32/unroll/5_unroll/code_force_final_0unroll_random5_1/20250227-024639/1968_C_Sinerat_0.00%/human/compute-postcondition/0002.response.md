Output State: **For each test case, a list `a` of length `n` is printed where `a[0]` is 500 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. The state of `t`, `n`, and `x` remains as per the input for each test case, but `a` is recalculated and printed for each test case.**
