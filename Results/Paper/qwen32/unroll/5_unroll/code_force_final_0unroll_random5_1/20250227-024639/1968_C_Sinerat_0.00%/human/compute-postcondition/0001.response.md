To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does for each test case:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the loop reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes a list `a` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. The first element `a[0]` is set to 500.
3. **Computation**: For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
4. **Output**: It prints the list `a`.

The loop processes each test case independently, and the state of variables `t`, `n`, and `x` changes for each iteration. However, the overall state after all iterations can be described in terms of the final printed lists for each test case.

**Output State**: **For each test case, a list `a` of size `n` is printed where `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`.**

In simpler terms, for each test case, the output is a list starting with 500, where each subsequent number is the sum of the previous number and the next number from the input list `x`.
