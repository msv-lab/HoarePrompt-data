You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n

            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: For each test case, a list `a` of length `n` is printed where `a[0]` is 500 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. The state of `t`, `n`, and `x` remains as per the input for each test case, but `a` is recalculated and printed for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to find an array \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) such that:
- \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
- \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

The provided program attempts to generate such an array \(a\) for each test case. Here's a breakdown of its approach:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes the first element of array \(a\) to 500.
2. **Generating the Array**:
   - For each subsequent element \(a_i\) (where \(i \ge 2\)), it sets \(a_i\) to \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\).
3. **Output**: It prints the array \(a\) for each test case.

Let's check if this approach satisfies the conditions of the problem:

- **Condition 1**: \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).
  - The first element \(a_0\) is set to 500, which satisfies the condition.
  - For subsequent elements, \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\). Since \(x_i \le 500\), and \(a_0 = 500\), the maximum possible value of \(a_i\) will be \(500 + 500 + \dots + 500\) (up to \(n-1\) times), which is \(500 \times n\). Given \(n \le 500\), the maximum value of \(a_i\) will be \(500 \times 500 = 250000\), which is well within the \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) range.

- **Condition 2**: \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
  - By the construction \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), we have \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}\). This satisfies the condition.

Given these points, the program correctly constructs an array \(a\) that meets the problem's requirements for each test case.

**Conclusion**: The program is correct.
