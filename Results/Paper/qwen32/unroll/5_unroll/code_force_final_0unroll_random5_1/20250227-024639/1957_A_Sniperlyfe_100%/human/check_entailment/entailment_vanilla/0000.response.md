Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon.

### Key Points

- A regular polygon requires at least 3 sides.
- For a regular polygon with side length `s`, you need at least `s` sticks of length `s`.
- The goal is to maximize the number of such polygons.

### Provided Program Analysis

Here is the provided program for reference:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.

3. **Polygon Counting**:
   - The program then calculates the number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3 and summing these values.
   - The division by 3 is based on the assumption that the smallest regular polygon is a triangle (3 sides).

### Correctness Analysis

- **Assumption**: The program assumes that the smallest regular polygon is a triangle. This assumption is correct because a regular polygon requires at least 3 sides.
- **Implementation**: The implementation correctly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed from the sticks of each length.
- **Output**: The sum of these values gives the total number of regular polygons that can be formed, which is the correct output for the problem.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks.

**Correctness: True**
