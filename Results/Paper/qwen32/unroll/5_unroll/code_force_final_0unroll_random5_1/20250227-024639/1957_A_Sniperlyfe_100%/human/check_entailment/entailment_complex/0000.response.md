Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is used in more than one polygon. However, the function incorrectly calculates the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 3, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

The function `func_1` should instead iterate through each unique stick length and determine how many polygons can be formed with that stick length. For each unique stick length, the number of polygons that can be formed is the integer division of the frequency of that stick length by the smallest possible number of sides for a regular polygon, which is 3 (a triangle). However, the function should also consider polygons with more sides (4, 5, etc.), and it should maximize the total number of polygons formed across all stick lengths.

The provided implementation only considers the integer division by 3 for each unique stick length and does not attempt to maximize the number of polygons by considering polygons with more sides. Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
