Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and outputs this difference. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The problem requires splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by the length of the subarray.

The given program does not perform any splitting of the array nor does it calculate the penalties as described. Instead, it performs a simple count of '+' and '-' characters and outputs their difference, which is not the intended solution.

Correctness: **False**
