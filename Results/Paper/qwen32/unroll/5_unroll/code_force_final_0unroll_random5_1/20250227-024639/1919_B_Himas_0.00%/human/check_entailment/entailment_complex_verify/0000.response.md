### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to split the array into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - The program does not consider any splitting of the array. It simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.
   - This difference does not provide any information about the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The program fails to implement any logic to split the array or calculate the penalty for different splits.

4. **Example**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     6
     +-+-+-
     ```
   - The correct minimum penalty is 0, as the array can be split into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, each of which has a penalty of 0.
   - However, the provided program will output `0` only because the counts of '+' and '-' are equal. This is a coincidence and not a general solution.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. It only computes the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which is not related to the minimum penalty calculation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not compute the minimum possible penalty by considering the optimal way to split the array.
