To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what each iteration of the loop does. Each iteration of the loop reads an integer `s` (which is not used in the loop body) and a string `e` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It then counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters.

Since the value of `s` is not used in the loop, it can be ignored for the purpose of determining the output. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it computes the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e` and prints that difference.

The output state after all iterations will be the printed results for each test case. Since the problem does not specify what to do with these results beyond printing them, we can describe the output state as the series of printed differences for each test case.

Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, where each line is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the corresponding input string e.**
