Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem described. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the optimal splitting of the array derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. However, the given program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and outputs this difference. This does not take into account the penalty calculation or the optimal splitting of the array.

The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The provided program does not implement this logic and thus does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
