### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its function `func_1` in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- If no such array exists, we should return `-1`.
- Increasing subsequences are sequences that can be derived by removing elements from the original array without changing the order, and the remaining elements must be strictly increasing.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n - 1, result)` where `n` is `X`.
   - `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that meets the criteria of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a `number` and a `sequence` list.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence and the value to append to the sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences.
   - It recursively calculates the sequence until the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

#### Issues in the Program:

- **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. However, it does not handle the case where no such sequence exists.
- **Logic for Sequence Generation**: The logic inside `func_1` is complex and seems to be based on a mathematical approach to generate the sequence. However, it does not directly address the problem of generating an increasing subsequence with exactly `X` subsequences.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `X` is not a valid number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by any array of length at most 200.

#### Function Summary Analysis:

The function summary describes `func_1` as follows:
- It accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer `X` represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.
- The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending additional integers based on calculations involving `number` and the initial `sequence` values.
- However, the function always returns the tuple `(0, 0)` regardless of the input values.

This summary is incorrect because:
- The function does not return any value. It modifies the `sequence` list in place.
- The function does not always return `(0, 0)`. It performs calculations and appends values to the `sequence` list based on the input `number`.

#### Correctness:

The provided program does not guarantee that it will find a valid array for all valid inputs `X` within the constraints. It also does not handle the case where no such array exists by returning `-1`. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem description.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to handle the case where no valid array exists and does not ensure that the generated array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
