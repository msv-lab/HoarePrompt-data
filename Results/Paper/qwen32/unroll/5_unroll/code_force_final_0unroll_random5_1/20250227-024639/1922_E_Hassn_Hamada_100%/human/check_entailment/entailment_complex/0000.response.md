Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for generating an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences, but it incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` immediately after checking if `number` is zero. Additionally, the function does not properly handle the case when `number` is not zero, and the logic for generating the sequence is flawed. The function does not correctly append elements to the sequence to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences. The overall structure and logic of the function do not align with the problem requirements.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
