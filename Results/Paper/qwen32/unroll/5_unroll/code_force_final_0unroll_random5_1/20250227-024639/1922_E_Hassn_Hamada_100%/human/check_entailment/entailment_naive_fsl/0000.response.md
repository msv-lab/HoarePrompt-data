Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to be attempting to generate a sequence that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences, but there are a few issues that suggest it may not work correctly for all cases.

1. **Function `func_1` and its usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n - 1` as the argument, which seems to be an off-by-one error. The function should be called with `n` directly since the problem requires exactly `X` subsequences.
   
2. **Binary representation and sequence generation**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary representation to generate the sequence. It calculates the number of increasing subsequences based on the binary representation of the number. However, the logic inside the function seems overly complex and might not handle all edge cases correctly, especially for very large values of `X` (up to \(10^{18}\)).

3. **Handling of large values of `X`**:
   - The function uses bit shifting operations to calculate the number of subsequences. While this is a common technique for such problems, the implementation details might not be robust enough to handle all edge cases, especially for very large values of `X`.

4. **Edge cases**:
   - The function `func_1` uses assertions and specific calculations based on the binary representation of the number, which might not cover all possible values of `X` correctly. For example, if `X` is a power of 2, the function might not generate the correct sequence.

5. **Output format**:
   - The program is supposed to output `-1` if it is impossible to find the required array. However, the provided code does not handle this case explicitly. It assumes that a valid sequence can always be generated for any `X` within the given range, which might not be true.

Given these points, it is likely that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially for very large values of `X`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
