Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Applying Operations:**
   - The program attempts to apply the operation in a loop from the start of the array to the second-to-last element. However, it incorrectly assumes that the operation can be applied `b[i]` times in a single step, which is not how the problem defines the operation.
   - The operation can only be applied if `b[i-1] >= 1`, `b[i] >= 2`, and `b[i+1] >= 1`. The program does not check these conditions properly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero. There might be negative values or non-zero values in the array that were not addressed by the operations.

3. **Incorrect Update of Array Elements:**
   - The program incorrectly updates the array elements. It subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i+1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`, and then sets `b[i]` to zero. This does not reflect the actual operation described in the problem.

4. **No Proper Iterative Approach:**
   - The problem requires an iterative approach to repeatedly apply the operation until no more operations can be applied, or until it is determined that it is impossible to make all elements zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to make all elements zero
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            while a[i] > 0 and a[i - 1] > 0 and a[i + 1] > 0:
                a[i - 1] -= 1
                a[i] -= 2
                a[i + 1] -= 1
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program checks if the sum of the array is even, which is a necessary condition for the problem. It then iteratively applies the operation to try and make all elements zero, and finally checks if all elements are indeed zero.
