Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by simply counting the number of pairs of cards you have. However, this approach does not take into account the optimal strategy of Nene, who always plays to maximize her score and minimize yours. 

The program does not simulate the game or consider the sequence of moves that both players might make. It assumes that all pairs in your hand will result in a point, which is not always the case, especially considering Nene's optimal play.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to simulate the game, taking into account the optimal moves of both players. This involves more complex logic than simply counting pairs in your hand.
