To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the only variable we can adjust is `t`.

The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because the `range(t)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`, and the loop will iterate over this sequence. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

Given the problem statement, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**
