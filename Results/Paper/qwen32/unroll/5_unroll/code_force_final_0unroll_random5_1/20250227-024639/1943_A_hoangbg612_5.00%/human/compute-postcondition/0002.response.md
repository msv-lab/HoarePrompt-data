To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the code given the initial state and the loop's logic.

### Code Analysis

1. **Outer Loop**: Runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Logic**:
   - Reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`.
   - Sorts the list `N`.
   - Initializes `cur` to -1 and an empty dictionary `M`.
   - Iterates through the sorted list `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
       - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks the loop.
       - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and initializes `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments `M[cur]` by 1.
   - After the loop, if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, it iterates through the range of `cur` and checks if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - Prints the final value of `cur`.

### Output State

The output state after all iterations of the loop will be the final value of `cur` for each test case. Since we are not given specific values for `T`, `S`, and `N`, we can describe the output state in a general form.

The output state after all iterations of the loop will be a series of values of `cur` for each test case.

### Output State Format

Since we do not have specific values, we will describe the output state in a general form:

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the final value of `cur` for each test case.**

If we had specific values, we could compute the exact series of integers. For example, if `T = 2`, `S1 = 5`, `N1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, `S2 = 3`, `N2 = [1, 2, 3]`, the output state would be computed as follows:

- For the first test case, `cur` would be 4.
- For the second test case, `cur` would be 3.

Thus, the output state would be:

Output State: **4 3**

Since we do not have specific values, the general form is:

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the final value of `cur` for each test case.**
