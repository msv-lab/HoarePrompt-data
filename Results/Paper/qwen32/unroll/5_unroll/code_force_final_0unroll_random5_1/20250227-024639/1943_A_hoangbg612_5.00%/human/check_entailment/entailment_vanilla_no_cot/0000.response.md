Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to array `c` (Alice also deletes elements from `a`).
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine the final MEX of `c` by analyzing the input array `a`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `T` is read.
   - For each test case, the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself are read.

2. **Sorting and Counting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in `N`.
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` and represents the current MEX candidate.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - If a number in `N` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means there's a gap, and `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If a number is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to this number.
   - If a number is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1 (indicating that all numbers up to `cur` are present).
   - Finally, it checks if any number `i` in the range `[0, cur)` has a count in `M` that is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `cur` to `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is intended to be the MEX.

### Issues with the Program:
- The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the part where it checks for gaps in the sorted array and counts occurrences in `M` is not correctly implemented to find the MEX.
- The final check for counts in `M` does not correctly reflect the MEX calculation.
- The program does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob, which involve strategic choices of elements to maximize or minimize the MEX.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The key observation is that the MEX of the final array `c` will be determined by the smallest number that is not present in the final array `c` after both players have made their optimal moves. This can be efficiently determined by counting the occurrences of each number and using a greedy approach to simulate the game.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.
