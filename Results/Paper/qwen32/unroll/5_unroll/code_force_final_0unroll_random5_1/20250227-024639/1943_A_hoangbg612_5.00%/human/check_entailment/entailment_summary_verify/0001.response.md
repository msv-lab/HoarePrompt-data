### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted. Sorting is not necessary for determining the MEX. The MEX can be found by counting the occurrences of each number.

3. **Determining MEX:**
   - The program initializes `cur` to -1, representing the current maximum MEX value found.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in the array.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it means there is a gap, and the MEX is `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and continues.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, if all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `M` with a count greater than their value, it increments `cur` by 1, indicating that the MEX is `cur + 1`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - The program iterates from 0 to `cur` to check if there is any number `i` such that `M[i] <= i`. If such a number is found, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop. This step seems unnecessary and potentially incorrect.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which represents the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

#### Issues and Corrections:

- **Sorting:** Sorting the array is unnecessary for determining the MEX. The MEX can be determined by counting occurrences of numbers and finding the smallest missing number.
- **Dictionary Usage:** The dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences, but the logic for determining the MEX can be simplified.
- **Final Check:** The final check to find a number `i` such that `M[i] <= i` is redundant and incorrect. The MEX is already determined by the time the loop completes.

#### Correctness:

The program's logic for determining the MEX is flawed due to the unnecessary and incorrect final check. The program can be simplified and corrected by directly counting occurrences and finding the smallest missing number.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        count = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            if num < S:
                count[num] += 1
        mex = 0
        for i in range(S):
            if count[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
        print(mex)

func()
```

This implementation correctly counts the occurrences of each number and finds the smallest missing number, which is the MEX.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis and the identified issues, the original program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
