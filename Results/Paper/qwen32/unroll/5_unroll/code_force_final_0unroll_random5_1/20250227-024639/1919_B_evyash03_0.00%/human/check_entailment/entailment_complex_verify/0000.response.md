Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` does not properly handle the calculation of penalties for all possible splits of the array. Instead of calculating the penalties based on the absolute value of the sum and the length of each segment, the function only counts the number of segments where the cumulative balance becomes zero or negative and resets the balance to zero. This approach does not lead to the optimal split points that minimize the total penalty.

The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic for calculating penalties. The function simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty based on the absolute sum and length of each segment.

The provided counterexample further illustrates the inaccuracy of the program. For the input `+-+--+`, the program outputs `3`, whereas the correct minimum penalty is `4`. This discrepancy confirms that the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Final: **False**
