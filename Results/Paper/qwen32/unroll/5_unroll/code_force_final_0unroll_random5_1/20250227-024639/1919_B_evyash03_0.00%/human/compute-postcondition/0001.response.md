The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `balance`. The variables `expression` and `length` remain unchanged, and `count` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters "+" and "-", `length` is an integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `count` is 0, `balance` is 0.**
