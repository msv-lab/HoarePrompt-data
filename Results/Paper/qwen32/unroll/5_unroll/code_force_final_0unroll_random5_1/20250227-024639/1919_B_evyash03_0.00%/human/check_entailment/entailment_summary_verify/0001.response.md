### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to split the string `s` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Splitting the Expression**:
   - The line `parts = expression.split('-')` splits the string by `'-'`. This operation does not help in calculating the minimum penalty. The split parts are not used in the subsequent calculations.
   - The line `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))` calculates the sum of lengths of the parts, which is also not relevant to the penalty calculation.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates a count based on the balance of `'+'` and `'-'` characters in the string.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the balance.
     - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the balance.
     - If the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0.
   - After the loop, it adds 1 to the count if the balance is greater than 0.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` returns the sum of the number of times the cumulative balance went negative and was reset to 0, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. This summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. The logic in `func_1` counts the number of times the cumulative balance goes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive, which is not the correct approach for minimizing the penalty.
- The penalty calculation should consider the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length. The function `func_1` does not handle this calculation.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the function `func_1` with the given examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `+`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - `func_1('+', 1)` returns `1` (balance goes positive, no reset, final balance > 0).

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `-----`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - `func_1('-----', 5)` returns `5` (balance goes negative 5 times, resets each time).

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - `func_1('+-+-+-', 6)` returns `0` (balance goes positive and negative alternately, final balance = 0).

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `--+++++++--`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - `func_1('--+++++++--', 10)` returns `4` (balance goes negative twice, resets, final balance = 0).

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - `func_1('+---++++-+++++---++-', 20)` returns `4` (balance goes negative multiple times, resets, final balance = 0).

While the function `func_1` produces the expected outputs for the given examples, the logic does not generalize to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`, but it does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty based on the absolute sum and length of subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
