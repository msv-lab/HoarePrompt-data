### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step by step:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of this list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Processing Each Password:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each password.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is added to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is added to the `letters` list.
   - The program then checks if there is any letter that comes after a digit. It does this by keeping track of the index of the last digit encountered (`last_digit_index`). If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), the function returns 'NO'.
   - Next, the program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Output:**
   - The results for all test cases are collected in a list and printed at the end.

### Verification Against Given Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Password: `12ac`
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - No letter comes after a digit.
  - Result: 'YES'

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Password: `123wa`
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['w', 'a']` (not sorted)
  - Result: 'NO'

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Password: `allllmost`
  - Digits: `[]` (no digits)
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - Result: 'YES'

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Password: `ac123`
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - There is a digit after a letter.
  - Result: 'NO'

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Password: `011679`
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `[]` (no letters)
  - Result: 'YES'

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Based on the reasoning and verification against the provided test cases, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
