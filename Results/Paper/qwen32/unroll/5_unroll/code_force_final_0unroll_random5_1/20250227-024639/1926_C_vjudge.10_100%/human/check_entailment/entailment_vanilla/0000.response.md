### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a variable `inf` to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\) to ensure it can handle the maximum possible value of \(n\) as specified in the problem.
   - It creates a list `values` of size `inf` initialized to 0. This list will be used to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to each index.

2. **Pre-computation**:
   - The program then iterates from 1 to `inf - 1` (i.e., up to \(2 \times 10^5\)).
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers.
   - It updates the `values` list at index `i` to be the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `i`. This is done by adding the sum of the digits of `i` to the value at index `i-1` in the `values` list.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n` from the `values` list.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described above. It pre-computes the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to the maximum possible value of `n` and then uses this pre-computed data to quickly answer each test case.

However, there is a critical issue with the provided code. The function `func_1()` is defined but never called. This means that the code inside `func_1()` will not be executed when the script is run. To make the program work, the function `func_1()` should be called at the end of the script.

Here's the corrected version of the code with the function call added:

```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])

# Call the function
func_1()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the original code without the function call, the program is incomplete and will not execute the intended logic. Therefore, the original program as provided is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
