The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The state of `inf`, `values`, and the individual `n` values do not directly affect whether the loop will execute; they are part of what the loop will operate on once it starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `t` to be at least 1. The other variables can remain as they are described.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where the first 200001 elements contain the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to the respective index, and the rest are 0**
