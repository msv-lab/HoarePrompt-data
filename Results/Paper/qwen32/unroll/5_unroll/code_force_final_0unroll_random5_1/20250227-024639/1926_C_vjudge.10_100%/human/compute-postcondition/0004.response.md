The loop iterates from 1 to `inf` (which is 200001), calculating the sum of the digits of each number `i` and updating the `values` list accordingly. The `values` list at index `i` will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

Let's break down what happens in the loop:

1. For each `i` from 1 to 200000, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i`.
2. It adds this sum to the previous cumulative sum stored in `values[i-1]` and stores the result in `values[i]`.

After the loop completes, `values` will contain the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to 200000. The first 200001 elements of `values` will be updated, while the rest (if any) will remain as 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list where the first 200001 elements contain the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to the respective index, and the rest are 0.**
