Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, the function returns a specific result based on the comparison and processing of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
