Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the string `c` matches a specific derived template based on `a` and `b`, and 'NO' otherwise. The template is derived by comparing characters of `a` and `b` at each position, using lowercase characters if they match and uppercase characters if they do not. The function checks that `c` matches the template only at positions where the template has lowercase characters, and does not match at positions where the template has uppercase characters.**
