Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the length of the strings and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction**: For each position in the strings, the program constructs a template:
   - If the characters at the current position in `a` and `b` are the same, the template at that position is set to that character (lowercase).
   - If the characters are different, the template at that position is set to the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, it doesn't matter which one since they are different).

3. **Matching Check**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` match the template.
     - If the template character is lowercase, both `a` and `b` must have the same character at that position.
     - If the template character is uppercase, both `a` and `b` must have characters different from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.
   - The program then checks if `c` does not match the template.
     - If the template character is lowercase, `c` must have the same character at that position.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c` must have a character different from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.

4. **Output**: Based on the checks, the program prints "YES" if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, otherwise it prints "NO".

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description, and the example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
