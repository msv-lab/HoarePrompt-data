To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the code processes the input and what the final printed results are for each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - For each iteration (from 0 to `t-1`), the code reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`.

2. **Template Creation:**
   - The `template` list is created by iterating over each character of `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the character is added to `template` in lowercase. Otherwise, it is added in uppercase.

3. **Matching `a` and `b` with Template:**
   - `match_a_b` is a boolean flag that checks if `a` and `b` match the `template` correctly. It is set to `False` if:
     - A lowercase character in `template` does not match the corresponding character in both `a` and `b`.
     - An uppercase character in `template` matches the corresponding character in either `a` or `b`.

4. **Matching `c` with Template:**
   - `match_c` is a boolean flag that checks if `c` matches the `template` correctly. It is set to `False` if:
     - A lowercase character in `template` does not match the corresponding character in `c`.
     - An uppercase character in `template` matches the corresponding character in `c`.

5. **Output Decision:**
   - If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, the code prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the loop runs `t` times, the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed results, one for each iteration.

**Output State:** **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed results, one for each iteration from 1 to `t`.**
