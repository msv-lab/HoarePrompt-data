Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
Nikita starts with no cubes and can perform two types of moves:
- Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
- Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

The goal is to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Possible Moves**: Each move either adds or removes exactly 1 cube.
3. **Final State**: We need to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conditions for Achieving `m` Cubes:
1. **Parity Condition**: Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes must be even. This is because an even number of moves can be paired as additions and subtractions, which net to a change in the number of cubes by an even amount.
   - Therefore, `(n - m) % 2 == 0` must hold true.
2. **Non-negative Cubes**: The number of cubes cannot be negative, so `n` must be at least `m` to allow for enough moves to potentially add `m` cubes.
   - Therefore, `n >= m` must hold true.

### Provided Program:
The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Verification:
- The program correctly checks both necessary conditions (`n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`) to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
