### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program correctly reads multiple test cases.
- It accurately parses the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` for each test case.
- It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` as required.

#### Initial Checks:
- The program checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`a[pb-1]` and `a[ps-1]`) are equal to the maximum score in the array `a`.
- If both have the maximum score, it immediately prints "Draw".
- If Bodya has the maximum score, it prints "Bodya".
- If Sasha has the maximum score, it prints "Sasha".

These checks are correct and handle scenarios where one or both players start at the maximum score.

#### Simulating the Game:
- The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
- It keeps track of the scores for both players (`b` for Bodya and `s` for Sasha) and whether they have reached the maximum score (`foundb` and `founds`).
- For each turn, it updates the scores and positions of both players unless they have already found the maximum score.

The simulation logic is correct. It updates the positions based on the permutation array `p` and accumulates scores based on the array `a`.

#### Calculating Total Scores:
- The program calculates the total scores for both players by summing up the scores from each turn.
- It also calculates the potential maximum scores for both players if they were to stay at their current positions for the remaining turns.

The calculation of total scores and potential maximum scores is correct. It correctly considers the remaining turns and the maximum score found during the simulation.

#### Determining the Winner:
- Finally, the program compares the maximum potential scores of both players.
- It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's potential score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's potential score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

The winner determination logic is correct based on the calculated scores.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where both players start at the maximum score.
- It also handles cases where one player starts at the maximum score.

The edge cases are correctly handled by the initial checks.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and simulates the game accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
