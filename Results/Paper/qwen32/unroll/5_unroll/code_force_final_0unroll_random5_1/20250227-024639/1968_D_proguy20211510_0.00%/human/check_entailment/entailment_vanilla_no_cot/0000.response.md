Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game. Here are some key issues with the program:

1. **Handling of the maximum value in `a`:** The program checks if the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are at the maximum value in `a` and immediately determines the winner or a draw based on this. This is incorrect because the players can move through the permutation and potentially find a better score later in the game.

2. **Simulation of the game:** The program simulates the game for `k` turns, but it does not handle cycles in the permutation correctly. If a player enters a cycle, they will keep repeating the same positions and scores, and the program does not account for this efficiently.

3. **Optimization for large `k`:** The program does not handle the case where `k` is very large (`k <= 10^9`) efficiently. It simulates the game for `k` turns directly, which would be too slow for large `k`.

4. **Cycle detection and scoring:** The program does not correctly detect cycles in the permutation and calculate the scores for the remaining turns after entering a cycle. It incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value, they will stay there for the rest of the game, which is not always true.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Detect cycles in the permutation for both players.
- Calculate the score for each cycle and the number of turns before entering the cycle.
- Use this information to determine the final scores for both players after `k` turns.
- Compare the final scores to determine the winner or if the game is a draw.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not handle all cases as required by the problem statement.
