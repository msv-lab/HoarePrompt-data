### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are equal to the maximum score in the array `a`.
     - If both have the maximum score, it immediately prints "Draw".
     - If Bodya has the maximum score, it prints "Bodya".
     - If Sasha has the maximum score, it prints "Sasha".

3. **Simulating the Game:**
   - If neither player starts at the maximum score, the program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the scores for both players (`b` for Bodya and `s` for Sasha) and whether they have reached the maximum score (`foundb` and `founds`).
   - For each turn, it updates the scores and positions of both players unless they have already found the maximum score.

4. **Calculating Total Scores:**
   - The program calculates the total scores for both players by summing up the scores from each turn.
   - It also calculates the potential maximum scores for both players if they were to stay at their current positions for the remaining turns.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - Finally, the program compares the maximum potential scores of both players.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's potential score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's potential score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Analysis:

The program's logic is correct in the sense that it follows the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the scores accumulated over `k` turns. However, there are a few points to consider:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where both players start at the maximum score correctly.
  - It also handles the case where one player starts at the maximum score.

- **Simulation:**
  - The simulation for `k` turns is done correctly, considering the movement based on the permutation and the score accumulation based on the array `a`.

- **Potential Scores:**
  - The calculation of potential maximum scores is correct, taking into account the remaining turns after reaching the maximum score.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and simulates the game accurately.

### Correctness: **True**
