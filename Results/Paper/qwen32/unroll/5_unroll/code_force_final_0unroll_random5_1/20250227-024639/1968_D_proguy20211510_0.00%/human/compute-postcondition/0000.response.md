The provided code snippet only initializes two string variables `YES` and `NO` with the values `'YES'` and `'NO'`, respectively. No other variables are modified, and no calculations or logic are performed. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `YES` and `NO` variables.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'.**
