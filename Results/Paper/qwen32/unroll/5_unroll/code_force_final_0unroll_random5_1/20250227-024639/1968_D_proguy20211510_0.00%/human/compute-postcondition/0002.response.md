The code snippet provided only assigns a string of the alphabet to the variable `alpha`. None of the other variables or their values are changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the new variable `alpha`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
