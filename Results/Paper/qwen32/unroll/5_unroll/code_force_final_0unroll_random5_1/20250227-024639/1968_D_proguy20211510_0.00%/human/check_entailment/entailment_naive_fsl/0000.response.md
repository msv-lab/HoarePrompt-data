Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the logic for determining the scores of Bodya and Sasha over the k turns. The code attempts to handle the case where the maximum value in the array `a` is encountered and then assumes that the score will be the maximum value for the remaining turns, but this is not necessarily true.

Here is a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Explanation:**
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya's position: 3, score: 0 + a[3] = 0 + 5 = 5, stays on the same position.
  - Sasha's position: 2, score: 0 + a[2] = 0 + 2 = 2, moves to p[2] = 1.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya's position: 3, score: 5 + a[3] = 5 + 5 = 10, stays on the same position.
  - Sasha's position: 1, score: 2 + a[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, stays on the same position.

**Final results:**
- Bodya's score: 10
- Sasha's score: 9
- Bodya wins.

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate this scenario. It incorrectly assumes that once the maximum value is encountered, it will be added for the remaining turns, which is not the case as both players can choose to stay or move based on the optimal strategy to maximize their scores.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for this and potentially other similar cases.
