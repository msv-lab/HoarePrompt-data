In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` which iterates over `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will execute based on the integer value read from the input, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input value (which will be assigned to `t`) is at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha`) are not directly involved in controlling the execution of the loop and hence do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value (which will be `t`) is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
