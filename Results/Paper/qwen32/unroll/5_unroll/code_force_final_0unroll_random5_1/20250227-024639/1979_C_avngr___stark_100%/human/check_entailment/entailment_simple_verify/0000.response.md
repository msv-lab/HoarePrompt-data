### Reasoning:

The original assessment concludes that the provided code is incorrect and offers an alternative solution. However, let's carefully analyze the given code and the annotations to determine if it correctly addresses the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to distribute bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that the total bet \(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n\) is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, i.e., \(x_i \cdot k_i\) for each \(i\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
    - This is done using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

3. **Main Logic**:
    - For each test case, read \(n\) and the list of multipliers \(k\).
    - Compute the LCM \(m\) of all multipliers \(k\).
    - Compute the bets \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\) for each outcome.
    - Check if the total bet \(\sum c_i\) is less than \(m\). If not, print \(-1\).
    - Otherwise, print the bets \(c_i\).

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that `func_2` computes the LCM of the multipliers.
- The bets are calculated as \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\), and the total bet is checked against \(m\).

#### Verification:
- The LCM \(m\) of the multipliers is a number that is divisible by each \(k_i\).
- By setting \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\), we ensure that \(c_i \cdot k_i = m\).
- The total bet is \(\sum c_i\), which is the sum of \(\frac{m}{k_i}\) for all \(i\).
- Since \(m\) is the LCM, \(\sum \frac{m}{k_i}\) is the smallest possible total bet that meets the condition \(c_i \cdot k_i > \sum c_i\) for all \(i\).

#### Conclusion:
- The provided code correctly computes a valid distribution of bets that satisfies the problem's requirements.
- The original assessment incorrectly states that the code does not address the problem, as it does correctly compute a valid distribution of bets.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
