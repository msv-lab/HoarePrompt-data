### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

#### Key Observations Recap:
1. **Single Color Rows and Columns**: If the first and last rows (or columns) of the grid are both single-colored and have different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the operation cannot bridge different single-colored rows or columns.
2. **General Case**: If the grid does not meet the above condition, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color by expanding single-colored regions.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The solution checks:
- If the first and last rows are both single-colored and have different colors, it prints "NO".
- If the first and last columns are both single-colored and have different colors, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid defined by dimensions `n` and `m` and filled with characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it evaluates the grid and prints 'NO' if either the first and last rows are identical and consist of the same character, or the first and last columns are identical and consist of the same character but are different from each other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

#### Correctness of the Solution:
The provided solution correctly implements the key observations. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Checking Single-Color Rows**:
   - `len(set(a[0])) == 1` checks if the first row is single-colored.
   - `len(set(a[-1])) == 1` checks if the last row is single-colored.
   - `a[0] != a[-1]` checks if the first and last rows are different.
   - If all these conditions are met, the solution correctly prints "NO".

2. **Checking Single-Color Columns**:
   - `len(set(first_row)) == 1` checks if the first column is single-colored.
   - `len(set(last_row)) == 1` checks if the last column is single-colored.
   - `first_row != last_row` checks if the first and last columns are different.
   - If all these conditions are met, the solution correctly prints "NO".

3. **General Case**:
   - If neither the rows nor the columns are both single-colored and different, the solution correctly prints "YES".

The solution effectively handles the conditions outlined in the problem description and the key observations. It ensures that if the first and last rows or columns are both single-colored and different, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color, and it correctly returns "NO" in such cases. In all other cases, it correctly returns "YES".

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct based on the problem description and the key observations derived from it.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
