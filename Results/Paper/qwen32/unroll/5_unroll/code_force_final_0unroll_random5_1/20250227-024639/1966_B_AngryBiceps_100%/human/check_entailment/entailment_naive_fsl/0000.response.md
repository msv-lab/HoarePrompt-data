Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The logic in the code is flawed and does not fully capture the conditions under which it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

The code checks if the first and last rows are monochromatic (all squares in the row are of the same color) and if they are different. It also checks if the first and last columns are monochromatic and different. If either of these conditions is met, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, this logic is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid monochromatic. Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the flaw:

**Counterexample:**

```
1
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```

For this input, the first row is "BWB" and the last row is "BWB", so they are not different. The first column is "BWB" and the last column is "BWB", so they are not different. According to the code, the output would be "YES". However, it is impossible to make all squares in this grid the same color using the described operations.

The correct approach would involve checking if there exists a monochromatic subrectangle that can be expanded to cover the entire grid. This is a more complex problem and requires a different algorithmic approach.

Since the provided code does not handle this case correctly, it is incorrect.
