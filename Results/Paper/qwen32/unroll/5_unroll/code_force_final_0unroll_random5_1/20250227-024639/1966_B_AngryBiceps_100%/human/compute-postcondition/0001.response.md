Output State: **The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `t` indicates the number of test cases processed, and for each test case, the grid properties are evaluated to determine if the output is 'YES' or 'NO'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reused for each test case without retaining their values from previous iterations.**
