Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid defined by dimensions `n` and `m` and filled with characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it evaluates the grid and prints 'NO' if either the first and last rows are identical and consist of the same character, or the first and last columns are identical and consist of the same character but are different from each other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.**
