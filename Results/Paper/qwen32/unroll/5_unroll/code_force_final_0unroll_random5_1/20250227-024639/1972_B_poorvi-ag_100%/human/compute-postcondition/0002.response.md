The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over is determined by `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already given to be in the range 1 to 100, the loop will definitely execute as long as `t` is within this range.

However, the task specifies that we must adhere to the format and only adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, there's no need to adjust `t` because it is already within the valid range. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts, so we don't need to adjust it either.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `i` is 0**
