The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state includes `t` as an input integer within a specific range and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` as an integer and `s` as a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The code snippet does not modify `t`, `n`, or `s`, but it does create a new list `results` which is initially empty.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". `results` is an empty list.**
