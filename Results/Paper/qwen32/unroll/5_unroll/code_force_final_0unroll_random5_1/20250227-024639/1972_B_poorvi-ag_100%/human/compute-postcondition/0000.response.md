Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D".**

Explanation: The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The constraints on `t` (1 <= `t` <= 100) remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this line of code and retain their initial descriptions.
