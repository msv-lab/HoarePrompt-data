Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty list called `results`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `test_cases`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
