To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the `results` list.

The loop processes each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n`. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to reach the end of the second row (`row2`) starting from the beginning of the first row (`row1`).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. Initialize `reachable_first_row` to `True` (indicating that the first row is initially reachable) and `reachable_second_row` to `False` (indicating that the second row is initially not reachable).
2. Iterate through each character in the rows:
   - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
     - If the current character in `row1` is `>`, check if it's the last character. If so, set `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating that the second row can be reached from the end of the first row).
     - If the current character in `row1` is `<`, set `reachable_first_row` to `False`. If the current character in `row2` is `>` and it's not the last character, set `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating that the second row can be reached from the current position in the second row).
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and the current character in `row2` is `>`, check if it's the last character. If so, keep `reachable_second_row` as `True`.
3. After the loop, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, append `'YES'` to the `results` list; otherwise, append `'NO'`.

The `results` list will contain a series of `'YES'` or `'NO'` strings, each corresponding to a test case.

Given that the `results` list is initially empty and the loop appends a result for each test case, the final state of `results` will be a list of `'YES'` and `'NO'` strings indicating whether the second row was reachable from the first row for each test case.

Output State: **`results` is a list of strings, each being either 'YES' or 'NO', corresponding to whether the second row is reachable from the first row for each test case.**
