Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` which calculates the cost to sort the string. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0. `cost` will store the total cost of operations needed, and `one` will count the number of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iterating through the string**: It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments `one` by 1.
   - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means we've encountered a '0' after some '1's. To sort the string, we need to move these '1's to the right of this '0'. The cost to do this is the number of '1's encountered so far (`one`) plus 1 (the length of the substring starting from the first '1' to this '0'). This cost is added to `cost`.

The key idea here is that each time we encounter a '0' after some '1's, we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring these '1's to the right of this '0'. The cost of this shift is the number of '1's encountered so far plus 1.

Let's verify the provided program with the example inputs:

1. **Input: 10**
   - `one` becomes 1.
   - When encountering '0', `cost` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

2. **Input: 0000**
   - No '1's, so `cost` remains 0.
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

3. **Input: 11000**
   - `one` becomes 2.
   - When encountering the first '0', `cost` becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
   - When encountering the second '0', `cost` becomes 3 + 3 = 6.
   - When encountering the third '0', `cost` becomes 6 + 4 = 10.
   - Output: 10 (Incorrect, expected: 9)

4. **Input: 101011**
   - `one` becomes 1.
   - When encountering the first '0', `cost` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
   - `one` becomes 2.
   - When encountering the second '0', `cost` becomes 2 + 3 = 5.
   - Output: 5 (Correct)

5. **Input: 01101001**
   - `one` becomes 1.
   - When encountering the first '0', `cost` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
   - `one` becomes 2.
   - When encountering the second '0', `cost` becomes 2 + 3 = 5.
   - `one` becomes 3.
   - When encountering the third '0', `cost` becomes 5 + 4 = 9.
   - `one` becomes 4.
   - When encountering the fourth '0', `cost` becomes 9 + 5 = 14.
   - Output: 14 (Incorrect, expected: 11)

The program seems to be incorrect for some test cases. The cost calculation does not correctly account for the minimum number of operations needed to sort the string.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
