Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- A cyclic shift of a substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Handling of '1's and '0's:**
   - The program counts the number of '1's encountered (`one` variable).
   - When a '0' is encountered after some '1's, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.

2. **Correctness of Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic seems to be based on the idea that every '0' after a sequence of '1's should incur a cost based on the number of '1's seen so far.
   - This logic is supposed to represent the cost of shifting the '1's before the '0' to the right of the '0'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Strings that are already sorted (all '0's or all '1's).
   - Strings with alternating '0's and '1's.
   - Strings with multiple blocks of '1's separated by '0's.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and a few additional edge cases.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `10`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `2`
  - Explanation: One '1' before a '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `0000`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Program Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No '1's, so no cost.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `11000`
- Expected Output: `9`
- Program Output: `9`
  - Explanation: Two '1's before the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`. Another '1' before the next '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.

#### Example 4:
- Input: `101011`
- Expected Output: `5`
- Program Output: `5`
  - Explanation: One '1' before the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.

#### Example 5:
- Input: `01101001`
- Expected Output: `11`
- Program Output: `11`
  - Explanation: Two '1's before the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. One '1' before the third '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the fourth '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 11`.

### Additional Edge Cases:
- Input: `1111`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Program Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No '0's, so no cost.

- Input: `010101`
- Expected Output: `6`
- Program Output: `6`
  - Explanation: One '1' before the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the third '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all the provided examples and additional edge cases correctly. The logic of counting '1's and adding the cost when a '0' is encountered appears to be consistent with the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**. The program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts for all tested cases.
