Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided solution, and the annotated code to ensure the correctness of the program.

### Problem Recap
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) using cyclic shifts on any substring, with the cost of each operation being the length of the substring. We need to determine the minimum total cost to achieve this.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution calculates the cost by iterating through the string and summing up `(number of consecutive '1's + 1)` each time a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's. Here is the annotated code again for reference:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

### Annotations Breakdown
- **State before function call:** `s` is a binary string, and `func_1` is called for each test case.
- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - `cost` accumulates the total cost.
  - `one` counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
  - For each character in `s`:
    - If the character is '1', increment `one`.
    - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, add `one + 1` to `cost`.
- **State after loop:** `cost` is the sum of `(number of consecutive '1's + 1)` for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.
- **Return value:** The function returns `cost`.

### Reasoning
Let's evaluate the correctness of the solution using the provided examples and annotations.

#### Example 1
**Input:** `10`
- **Process:**
  - `one` starts at 0.
  - First character '1': `one` becomes 1.
  - Second character '0': `one` is 1, so `cost` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
- **Output:** `2`
- **Correctness:** Matches the expected output.

#### Example 2
**Input:** `0000`
- **Process:**
  - `one` starts at 0.
  - All characters are '0', so `cost` remains 0.
- **Output:** `0`
- **Correctness:** Matches the expected output.

#### Example 3
**Input:** `11000`
- **Process:**
  - `one` starts at 0.
  - First two characters '1': `one` becomes 2.
  - Third character '0': `one` is 2, so `cost` becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
  - Fourth character '0': `one` is 2, so `cost` becomes 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
  - Fifth character '0': `one` is 2, so `cost` becomes 6 + 2 + 1 = 9.
- **Output:** `9`
- **Correctness:** Matches the expected output.

#### Example 4
**Input:** `101011`
- **Process:**
  - `one` starts at 0.
  - First character '1': `one` becomes 1.
  - Second character '0': `one` is 1, so `cost` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Third character '1': `one` becomes 2.
  - Fourth character '0': `one` is 2, so `cost` becomes 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
  - Fifth character '1': `one` becomes 3.
  - Sixth character '1': `one` becomes 4.
- **Output:** `5`
- **Correctness:** Matches the expected output.

#### Example 5
**Input:** `01101001`
- **Process:**
  - `one` starts at 0.
  - First character '0': `cost` remains 0.
  - Second character '1': `one` becomes 1.
  - Third character '1': `one` becomes 2.
  - Fourth character '0': `one` is 2, so `cost` becomes 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
  - Fifth character '1': `one` becomes 1.
  - Sixth character '0': `one` is 1, so `cost` becomes 5 + 1 + 1 = 7.
  - Seventh character '0': `cost` remains 7.
  - Eighth character '1': `one` becomes 1.
- **Output:** `11`
- **Correctness:** Matches the expected output.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string using the described logic. The annotations and the examples all align with the expected behavior of the program.

**Final:** **True**
