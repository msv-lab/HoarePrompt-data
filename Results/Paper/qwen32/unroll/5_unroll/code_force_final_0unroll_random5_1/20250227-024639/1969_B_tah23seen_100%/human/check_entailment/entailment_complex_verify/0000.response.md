### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version. The goal is to determine if the provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The task involves sorting a binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
- Each cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) incurs a cost of \( r - l + 1 \).
- The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each binary string \( s \), it calls `func_1(s)` to compute the cost.

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

### Annotations and Key Points:
- The variable `one` keeps track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered.
- When a '0' is encountered and `one` is greater than 0, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.
- The cost calculation seems to be based on the idea that each '0' following a sequence of '1's incurs a cost equal to the number of '1's seen so far plus one.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's analyze the logic and validate it against the problem description:

1. **Handling of '1's and '0's:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of '1's (`one` variable).
   - When a '0' is encountered after some '1's, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic seems to be based on the idea that every '0' after a sequence of '1's should incur a cost based on the number of '1's seen so far.
   - This logic is supposed to represent the cost of shifting the '1's before the '0' to the right of the '0'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Strings that are already sorted:** 
     - If the string is all '0's or all '1's, the cost is correctly calculated as 0.
   - **Strings with alternating '0's and '1's:**
     - The program correctly calculates the cost based on the number of '1's before each '0'.
   - **Strings with multiple blocks of '1's separated by '0's:**
     - The program correctly sums up the costs for each block of '1's followed by a '0'.

### Testing the Program:
We have already tested the program with the provided examples and additional edge cases. The program outputs the expected results for all these cases.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all the provided examples and additional edge cases correctly. The logic of counting '1's and adding the cost when a '0' is encountered appears to be consistent with the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts for all tested cases.

**Final: True**
