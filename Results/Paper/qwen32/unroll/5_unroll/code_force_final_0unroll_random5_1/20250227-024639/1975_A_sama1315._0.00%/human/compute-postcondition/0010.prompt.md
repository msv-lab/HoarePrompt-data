You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes, `index` will have been incremented by 1 for each `t` iterations (once for reading `n`), and by `n` for each set of integers read into `arr`.
    #   - `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(arr)` for the respective `arr` in each iteration.
    #   - `arr` will be the last list of integers processed by the loop.
    #   - `data` and `t` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
    #
    #Given the above, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the results of func_1(arr) for each set of integers read into arr in each iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of `n` positive integers where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The function returns the maximum value in the list `arr`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
