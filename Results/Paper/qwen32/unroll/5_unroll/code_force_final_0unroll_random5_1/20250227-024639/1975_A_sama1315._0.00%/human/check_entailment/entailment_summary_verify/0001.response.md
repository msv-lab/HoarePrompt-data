Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap:
The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The key insight is that the array can be sorted by a series of such operations if and only if there exists a point in the array where the sequence can be split such that the suffix followed by the prefix forms a sorted array.

### Analysis of Provided Code:

#### Function `func_1(arr)`:
- **Logic**: The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - If the array is sorted, it returns "Yes".
  - If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is any element greater than the next element.
  - If such an element exists, it returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes".
- **Issue**: This logic is incorrect. Checking if the array is sorted or not is not sufficient. The function does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping parts of the array to achieve a sorted order.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- **Logic**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, applies `func_1` to each test case, and prints the results.
- **Issue**: Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine if there exists a point in the array where the sequence can be split into two parts such that swapping these parts results in a sorted array. This involves checking if there is a non-decreasing sequence that can be formed by considering all possible splits and swaps.

### Revised Implementation:
Here is a revised version of `func_1` that correctly implements the logic:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        if all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(n - 1)):
            return 'Yes'
        arr = arr[1:] + arr[:1]  # Rotate the array to check all possible splits
    return 'No'
```

### Evaluation of Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the provided code. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the logic of checking for possible splits and swaps to determine if the array can be sorted. Thus, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. It only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.
Final: **False**
