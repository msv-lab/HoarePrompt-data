The code snippet initializes an empty list `results`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `results` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
