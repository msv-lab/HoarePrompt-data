To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of n positive integers.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
   - `index` is 1.
   - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`.
     - `index` is incremented by 1.
     - `arr` is set to a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
     - `index` is incremented by `n`.
     - `result` is calculated by calling `func_1(arr)`.
     - `result` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output State:**
   - After the loop finishes, `index` will have been incremented by 1 for each `t` iterations (once for reading `n`), and by `n` for each set of integers read into `arr`.
   - `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(arr)` for the respective `arr` in each iteration.
   - `arr` will be the last list of integers processed by the loop.
   - `data` and `t` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Given the above, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`arr` is the last list of integers processed by the loop; `data` is unchanged; `index` is the position in `data` after all iterations; `t` is unchanged; `results` is a list of `t` results from `func_1(arr)` for each iteration.**
