Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- **`index`**: This variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration `t` (when reading `n`) and by `n` for each set of integers read into `arr`. However, the exact value of `index` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- **`results`**: This is a list containing `t` elements. Each element is the result of calling `func_1(arr)` for the respective `arr` in each iteration. Therefore, `results` contains the output of `func_1` for each set of integers read into `arr`.
- **`arr`**: This is the last list of integers processed by the loop. However, the exact content of `arr` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- **`data` and `t`**: These remain unchanged throughout the loop and are not directly involved in the `print` statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement joins all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Each element in `results` is the result of `func_1(arr)` for each set of integers read into `arr`.

### Output:
Since `results` contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(arr)` for the respective `arr` in each iteration, the output will be a string with `t` lines, where each line is the result of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration.

Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the results of func_1(arr) for each set of integers read into arr in each iteration)**
