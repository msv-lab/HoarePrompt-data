### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The provided code consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(arr)`**: This function checks if the given array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of an integer `n` (length of the array) followed by `n` integers (the array elements). For each test case, it calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order and stores the result. Finally, it prints all results.

However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect for the problem requirements. The function only checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not consider the possibility of achieving a sorted array through prefix-suffix swaps.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves identifying the point in the array where the order breaks and checking if the array can be split into two parts such that swapping them results in a sorted array. Here's a correct approach:

- Identify the longest non-decreasing prefix of the array.
- Identify the longest non-decreasing suffix of the array.
- Check if the elements between the prefix and suffix can be rearranged by swapping the prefix and suffix to form a non-decreasing array.

Given the current implementation of `func_1`, it does not perform this check and thus does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operation.

### Correctness:
**False**
