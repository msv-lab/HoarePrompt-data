### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the implementation of the program. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping any prefix with its suffix.
   - This is not simply checking if the array is already sorted or not. It involves finding a point in the array where splitting and swapping can yield a sorted array.

2. **Key Points**:
   - If the array is already sorted, the answer is "Yes".
   - If there exists a point where the array can be split into a suffix and a prefix such that swapping them results in a sorted array, the answer is "Yes".
   - Otherwise, the answer is "No".

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
     - The function checks if the array is sorted using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
     - If the array is sorted, it returns "Yes".
     - If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is any element greater than the next element using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
     - If such an element exists, it returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes".
     - **Issue**: This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a sorted array. The function only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.

4. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the logic in `func_1` is insufficient. The function does not check for the possibility of splitting the array into two parts such that swapping them results in a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
