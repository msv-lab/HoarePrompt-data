Postcondition: **`good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b` based on frequency. If the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. `window_freq` reflects the frequency of elements in the last `m` elements of `a`, and `matches` reflects the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements in the last `m` elements of `a` that also appear in `b`.**
