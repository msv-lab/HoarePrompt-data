You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, then calls `func_1` a total of `t` times. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value explicitly.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorting a Binary String**: A binary string is sorted in non-descending order if all `0`s are to the left of all `1`s.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: Performing a cyclic shift on a substring can move `1`s to the left and `0`s to the right, but the key is to understand how the cost is associated with these shifts.

### Cost Calculation:
- **Counting `1`s**: When we encounter a `0` in the string after encountering a `1`, it implies that this `0` needs to be moved to the left of the `1`s. The cost to move this `0` is equivalent to the number of `1`s encountered so far plus one (to account for the shift operation).
- **Summing Costs**: The total cost is the sum of the costs of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1`.

### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - It reads a binary string `s`.
  - It initializes `n` (count of `1`s encountered) and `ans` (total cost).
  - It iterates through the string:
    - If it encounters a `1`, it increments `n`.
    - If it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero (meaning there have been `1`s before), it adds `n + 1` to `ans` (the cost to move this `0` to the left of the `1`s).
  - It prints the total cost `ans`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by counting the cost of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1`. This aligns with the problem's requirement to minimize the total cost of cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.

Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by summing up the costs of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1` in the string, which corresponds to the number of `1`s encountered so far plus one.

Correctness: **True**
