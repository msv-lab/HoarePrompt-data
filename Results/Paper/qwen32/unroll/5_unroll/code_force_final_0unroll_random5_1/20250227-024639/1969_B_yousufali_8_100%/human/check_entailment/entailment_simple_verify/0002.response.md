### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations provided.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

#### Key Points from the Problem:
1. **Sorting a Binary String**: The string should have all `0`s to the left of all `1`s.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: The cost of moving a `0` to the left of `1`s is the number of `1`s encountered so far plus one.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Reads a binary string `s`.
  - Initializes `n` (count of `1`s encountered) and `ans` (total cost).
  - Iterates through the string:
    - If it encounters a `1`, it increments `n`.
    - If it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero (indicating there have been `1`s before), it adds `n + 1` to `ans` (the cost to move this `0` to the left of the `1`s).
  - Prints the total cost `ans`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm the state of variables at key points in the code:
  - `n` is the count of `1`s encountered so far.
  - `ans` accumulates the cost as described.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with an example:
- Consider the string `11000`:
  - First character is `1`: `n = 1`, `ans = 0`.
  - Second character is `1`: `n = 2`, `ans = 0`.
  - Third character is `0`: `n = 2`, `ans = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Fourth character is `0`: `n = 2`, `ans = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - Fifth character is `0`: `n = 2`, `ans = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9`.

The calculated cost is `9`, which matches the example provided in the problem statement.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort a binary string by summing up the costs of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1` in the string, which corresponds to the number of `1`s encountered so far plus one.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.

**Final: True**
