Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` where `a` contains `n` integers and `b` contains `m` integers. The function returns a value (or values) based on the provided lists `a` and `b` for each test case.**
