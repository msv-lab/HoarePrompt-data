Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints a specific result based on the frequency of each integer in the list. If `n` is less than 3, the result is 0. Otherwise, the result is computed using combinations of the counts of unique integers in the list.**
