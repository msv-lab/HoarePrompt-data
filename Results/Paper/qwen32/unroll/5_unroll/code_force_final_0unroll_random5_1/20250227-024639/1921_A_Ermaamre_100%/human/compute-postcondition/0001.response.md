The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations the loop will run.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The state of `t` is already provided and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute. The pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) represent the coordinates of the corners of a square and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute. We just need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
