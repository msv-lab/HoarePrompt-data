You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length. For each test case, it checks if string `c` can be formed by characters from the corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`. It outputs "YES" if `c` can be formed in this manner, otherwise "NO". The final state of the program includes the processed values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and immediately prints "NO" if true. This part is correct. However, the logic for checking the template conditions is flawed.

Here’s the problematic part of the code:
```python
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1
```
The loop iterates over characters in `c` and checks if the character `x` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If `x` is not in both `a` and `b` at the same position, it prints "YES". This is incorrect because the template condition requires checking whether the character in the template is lowercase or uppercase.

Let's consider a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
3
acc
abd
abc
```
The program will output "NO" for this input, which is incorrect. Here’s why:
- For the first position, `a[0] = 'a'`, `b[0] = 'a'`, and `c[0] = 'a'`.
- For the second position, `a[1] = 'c'`, `b[1] = 'b'`, and `c[1] = 'b'`.
- For the third position, `a[2] = 'c'`, `b[2] = 'd'`, and `c[2] = 'c'`.

A valid template could be "AaA":
- `a` matches the template because 'a' is different from 'A', 'c' matches 'a', and 'c' matches 'A'.
- `b` matches the template because 'a' is different from 'A', 'b' is different from 'a', and 'd' is different from 'A'.
- `c` does not match the template because 'a' is different from 'A', 'b' matches 'a', and 'c' matches 'A'.

Thus, the correct output should be "YES" for this input, but the program outputs "NO". This shows that the program does not correctly handle the template conditions.
