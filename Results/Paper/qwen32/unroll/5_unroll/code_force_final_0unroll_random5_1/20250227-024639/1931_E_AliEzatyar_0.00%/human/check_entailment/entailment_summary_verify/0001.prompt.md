You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sashah'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. However, the function only examines the last element of the `num` list and counts the number of trailing '0' strings in reverse order until a non-'0' element is encountered. The function returns the count of these trailing '0' strings. Given the provided return postcondition, the function always returns 1, indicating that there is exactly one trailing '0' string in the last element of the `num` list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers. The goal is to determine if Sasha can win given optimal play from both sides. The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, i.e., when there is only one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number is not less than \(10^m\).

### Key Points:
1. **Anna's Move**: Chooses an element and reverses its digits, removing leading zeros.
2. **Sasha's Move**: Chooses two elements, concatenates them, and inserts the result back into the list.
3. **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number is \(\ge 10^m\).

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of integers \(n\), the parameter \(m\), and the list of integers.
2. **Digit Counting**: It calculates the total number of digits in all integers and identifies trailing zeros in each integer.
3. **Trailing Zeros Handling**: It sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order and sums every second count (starting from the first).
4. **Winning Condition Check**: It checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the selected trailing zeros is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Winner Name**: The program outputs `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`.
2. **Logic Error**: The logic for determining the winner seems flawed. The program attempts to use the count of trailing zeros to somehow determine the final number's size, but this approach does not correctly simulate the game's dynamics.
3. **Optimal Play Assumption**: The program assumes a strategy based on trailing zeros, which is not necessarily optimal. The optimal strategy involves considering the best possible concatenation by Sasha and the best reversal by Anna, which the program does not correctly simulate.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play by both players. It uses an incorrect approach and contains a typo in the winner's name.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
