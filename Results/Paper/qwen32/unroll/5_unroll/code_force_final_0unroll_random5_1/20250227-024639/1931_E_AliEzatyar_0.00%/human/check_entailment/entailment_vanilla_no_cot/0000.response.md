Correctness: **False**

The given program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Typo in the Output**: The string `'Sashah'` is used instead of `'Sasha'`. This will result in incorrect output for cases where Sasha is supposed to win.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Leading Zeros**: The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of trailing zeros in a number (not leading zeros as the comment suggests). However, the problem requires reversing the digits of a number, and the logic should account for how many digits are effectively removed by reversing numbers that end in zeros. The current logic counts trailing zeros, which is not directly useful for determining the final length of the concatenated number after optimal play.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**: The program calculates `total_digits` as the sum of the lengths of all numbers in the list. However, after Anna reverses a number, the length of the number might change due to the removal of leading zeros. The program does not account for this change in length.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Sasha's Moves**: Sasha's optimal strategy involves concatenating the smallest numbers first to avoid increasing the total number of digits too quickly. The program does not simulate this strategy; instead, it attempts to subtract the number of trailing zeros from the total number of digits, which does not accurately reflect Sasha's optimal play.

5. **Lack of Simulation of the Game**: The program does not simulate the actual game moves. It attempts to determine the winner based on a simplified calculation that does not account for the strategic decisions made by both players.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to simulate the game, taking into account the optimal moves for both Anna and Sasha, and correctly calculating the length of the final number after all moves are made.
