Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing a single element, 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remains unchanged. A new list named `prefix` is created and initialized with a single element, 0.
