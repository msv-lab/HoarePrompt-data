Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `prefix` is a list with `n + 1` elements. The first element is `0`, and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR results of the elements in `arr`.

### Output State:
- The `print` statement will output the contents of `arr` and `prefix`.

### Explanation:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `prefix` is constructed as follows:
  - `prefix[0]` is `0`.
  - `prefix[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `arr = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`:
- `prefix[0] = 0`
- `prefix[1] = a1`
- `prefix[2] = a1 ^ a2`
- `prefix[3] = a1 ^ a2 ^ a3`
- ...
- `prefix[n] = a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ ... ^ an`

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the list `arr` and the list `prefix` as they are defined.

### Final Output:
Output: **arr, prefix (where arr is the original list and prefix is the list of cumulative XOR results with the first element as 0)**

Since the exact values of `arr` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `prefix`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the original list `arr` and the list `prefix` as described.

Output: **arr, prefix (where arr is the original list and prefix is the list of cumulative XOR results with the first element as 0)**
