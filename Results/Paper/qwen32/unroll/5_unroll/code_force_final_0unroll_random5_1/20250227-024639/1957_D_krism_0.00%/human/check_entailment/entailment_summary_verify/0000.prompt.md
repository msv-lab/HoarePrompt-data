You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, computes a series of cumulative XOR results, and then calculates a specific sum based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the binary representation of these XOR results. It prints the original list, the list of cumulative XOR results, two lists (`pre` and `suf`) that contain counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position, and finally, the computed sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples \((x, y, z)\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n\) and \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

Here are the issues identified:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined but not called directly. The main loop reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case, but the function itself is not structured to return or print the required result for each test case.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array is correctly calculated, but the logic to count the valid tuples is incorrect. The prefix XOR array `prefix` is used to compute \(f(l, r)\) as `prefix[r+1] ^ prefix[l]`.

3. **Main Logic for Counting Tuples**: The main logic for counting valid tuples relies on the `pre` and `suf` arrays, which are supposed to keep track of the counts of bits being 0 or 1 at each bit position. However, the logic to update and use these arrays is flawed and does not correctly count the number of valid tuples.

4. **Debugging Statements**: The code includes several `print` statements for debugging purposes, which should be removed or commented out in the final version of the code.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
1
3
6 2 4
```

The correct output should be `4` as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided code does not correctly compute this result.

To fix the program, the logic for counting valid tuples needs to be revised. A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible tuples \((x, y, z)\) and checking the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\) directly. This can be optimized using prefix XOR values, but the implementation needs to be corrected.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    
    ans = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(x, n + 1):
            for z in range(y, n + 1):
                fx_y = prefix[y] ^ prefix[x-1]
                fy_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[y-1]
                fx_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[x-1]
                if fx_y ^ fy_z > fx_z:
                    ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This version of the code correctly counts the number of valid tuples by iterating over all possible \((x, y, z)\) and checking the condition directly. However, this approach is not efficient for large inputs due to its \(O(n^3)\) complexity. A more optimized approach using prefix XOR and bit manipulation would be needed for large inputs.
