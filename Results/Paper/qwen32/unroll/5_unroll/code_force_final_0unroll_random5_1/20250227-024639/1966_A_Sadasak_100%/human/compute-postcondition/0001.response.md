To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `arr`, which is a list of integers. The variables `num` and `arr` are the only ones directly involved in the loop head.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. The variable `num` will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration.

2. **Dependencies**: The loop will execute if and only if `arr` contains at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `k` and `frequency_table` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, if the loop body relies on these variables, they should be in a valid state when the loop starts.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `arr` has at least one element. The values of `k` and `frequency_table` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `k` is an integer, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
