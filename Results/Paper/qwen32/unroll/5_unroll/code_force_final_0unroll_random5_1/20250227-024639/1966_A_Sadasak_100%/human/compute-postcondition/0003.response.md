Output State: **The program returns `frequency_table`, which is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and its value is the minimum of the number of times that number appears in `arr` and `k`.**

In simpler terms, the output is a dictionary that maps each unique number in `arr` to the smaller value between how many times that number appears in `arr` and the integer `k`.
