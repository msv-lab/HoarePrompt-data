Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`. `inpstr` is assigned the value of the input string.**

In natural language: The value of `inpstr` is now the input string provided. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
