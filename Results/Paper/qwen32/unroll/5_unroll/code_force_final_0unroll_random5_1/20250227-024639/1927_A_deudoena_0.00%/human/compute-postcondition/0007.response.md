The given loop iterates over the `inpstr` string in reverse order to find the index of the last occurrence of the character 'B'. The variable `ind2` is updated with the index of this last 'B' from the end of the string. The loop breaks as soon as it finds this 'B'.

Here's the breakdown of the output state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `inpstr` remains unchanged as it is only read within the loop.
- `ind1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `ind2` is updated to the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr` from the end of the string.
- `outind` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

To summarize, the only variable that changes is `ind2`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in s; inpstr is assigned the value of the input string; ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in s; ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in s from the end of the string; outind is 0.**
