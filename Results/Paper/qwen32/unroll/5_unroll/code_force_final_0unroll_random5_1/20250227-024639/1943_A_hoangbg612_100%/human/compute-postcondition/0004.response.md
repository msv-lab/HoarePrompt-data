Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value `cur` based on the input list. The value of `cur` is determined by sorting the list and analyzing the frequency of each integer, ultimately selecting a value that meets certain conditions related to the sum of unique elements and their frequencies.**
