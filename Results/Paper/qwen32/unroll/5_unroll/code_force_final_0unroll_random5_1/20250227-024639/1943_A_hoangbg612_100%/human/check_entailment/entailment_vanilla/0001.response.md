Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is a reasonable step since it helps in determining the MEX more easily.

2. **Tracking the Current MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which will track the current MEX of the array `c` as elements are added.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the array `N`.

3. **Iterating Through the Sorted Array:**
   - The loop iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop since `cur + 1` would be the MEX.
   - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and increments the count of `num` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Handling the Case When All Numbers Are Used:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S` (the length of the array). If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `c`, and the next number (`cur + 1`) is the MEX.

5. **Handling the Case When There Are Multiple Numbers with a Count of 1:**
   - It creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If there are at least two such numbers, it sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt`. This step seems incorrect because it doesn't align with the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

6. **Printing the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Numbers with a Count of 1:**
  - The logic for handling multiple numbers with a count of 1 is incorrect. The program sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt` without considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The program does not correctly simulate their optimal strategies.

- **Incorrect Break Condition:**
  - The break condition `if num > cur + 1` is correct for finding the MEX if all numbers up to `cur` are present. However, the program does not correctly handle the case when there are gaps in the sequence of numbers.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob and does not always produce the correct MEX for the array `c` after the game ends.

**Correctness: False**
