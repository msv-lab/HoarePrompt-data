To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after the optimal moves by Alice and Bob. Let's break down the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. Sorting helps in easily finding the smallest missing non-negative integer.

3. **Finding the MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`. This variable will hold the current MEX.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - The program iterates over the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks the loop, as `cur + 1` is the smallest missing non-negative integer.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `num` in the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, if all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present in the array `N` (checked by comparing the sum of counts in `M` with `S`), it increments `cur` by `1`.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of numbers that appear exactly once in `N`.
   - If there are at least two such numbers, it sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of the array `c`.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Logic for Finding MEX:**
  - The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the MEX after optimal moves by Alice and Bob.
  - The program does not consider the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The program does not simulate these strategies.
  - The logic for updating `cur` and using the dictionary `M` is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

- **Incorrect Handling of Counts:**
  - The program uses the counts of numbers in `N` to determine the MEX, which is not the correct approach for this problem.
  - The program does not correctly handle cases where numbers are not consecutive or where Bob's moves affect the final MEX.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal moves:
- Alice should pick the largest possible number that does not affect the MEX.
- Bob should pick the smallest possible number that minimizes the MEX.

However, a simpler and more efficient approach is to use the fact that the MEX of the array `c` after optimal play can be determined by the parity of the counts of numbers in `N`:
- If the count of any number `i` is odd, then `i` will be in `c` after optimal play.
- The MEX will be the smallest number that is not in `c`.

Given the constraints, a more efficient approach would be to use a frequency array to count occurrences and then determine the MEX based on the parity of these counts.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the MEX after optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
