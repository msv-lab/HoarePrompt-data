The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints the optimal split point for each test case, where the split point is the position that minimizes the imbalance between the number of '0's and '1's on either side of the split. The output is a series of integers, each representing the optimal split point for the corresponding test case.
