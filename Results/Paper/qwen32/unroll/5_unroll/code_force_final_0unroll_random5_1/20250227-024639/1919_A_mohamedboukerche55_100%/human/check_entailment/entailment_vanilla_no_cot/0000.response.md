To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the game rules and the provided solution.

### Game Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns playing with their wallets containing `a` and `b` coins respectively. Each turn consists of two steps:
1. A player can choose to exchange wallets with the opponent or keep the current wallet.
2. The player then removes one coin from their current wallet.

The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

### Key Insight:
The game is essentially a deterministic game with a clear winning strategy based on the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.

- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is **even**, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is **odd**, Alice wins.

### Explanation:
- **Even Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is even, Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves until the last coin. Since Alice starts, Bob will be the one to take the last coin and leave Alice with no valid move.
- **Odd Total Coins**: If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always ensure she takes the last coin. She can mirror Bob's moves until there is one coin left, which she will take, leaving Bob with no valid move.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It calculates the total number of coins (`a + b`).
- It checks the parity of the total number of coins:
  - If even, it prints "Bob".
  - If odd, it prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which aligns with the game rules and the optimal strategy for both players.

**Correctness: True**
