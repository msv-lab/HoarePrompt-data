To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the code and understand the transformations it performs.

The provided code snippet is a loop that processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads an integer `n` which is the number of elements in the list `nums`.
2. Reads a list of integers `nums` of length `n`.
3. Counts the occurrences of each integer in `nums` using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.
4. Calculates a result `res` based on the counts:
   - If an integer appears at least 3 times, it adds the number of ways to choose 3 items from those counts to `res`.
   - If an integer appears at least 2 times, it adds the number of ways to choose 2 items from those counts, multiplied by the sum of counts of all other integers, to `res`.
5. Prints the result `res` for each test case.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

The variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `res` change with each iteration of the loop, and `res` is printed at the end of each iteration. However, after all iterations, the only variables that retain their final values are those outside the loop or those that are not overwritten within the loop. In this case, `t` remains unchanged, and `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `res` are reset at the beginning of each iteration.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is simply the state where the loop has completed all `t` iterations, and the only variable that retains a meaningful value (in the context of the final output) is the printed `res` for each test case. Since `res` is printed at the end of each iteration, the final output state is the sequence of printed results for each test case.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` printed results, where each result is the computed value of `res` for the corresponding test case.**
