Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided integers, ensuring that the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.**
