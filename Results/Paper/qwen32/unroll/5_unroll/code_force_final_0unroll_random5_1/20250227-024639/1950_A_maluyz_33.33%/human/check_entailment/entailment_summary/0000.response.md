Reasoning: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking for "STAIR"**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".

3. **Checking for "PEAK"**: The program checks if `b` is the maximum of the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `max(a, b, c) == b`. If this condition is true and `a != b` and `b != c` (implicitly handled by the previous condition), it prints "PEAK".

4. **Handling "NONE"**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE". This includes cases where `a == b == c` and other configurations that do not form a "STAIR" or "PEAK".

The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior, and the program adheres to the problem description. It correctly identifies and handles the three possible cases: "STAIR", "PEAK", and "NONE".

Correctness: **True**
