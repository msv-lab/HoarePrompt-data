Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Range**: The program calculates the range of valid `k` values by taking the maximum value from the `big` list (type 1 constraints) and the minimum value from the `less` list (type 2 constraints). However, it should calculate the number of integers within this range that do not violate any type 3 constraints.

2. **Incorrect Counting of Valid `k` Values**: The program only finds the first valid `k` value within the range and prints it. It does not count all valid `k` values.

3. **Logic Error in Loop**: The loop that checks for valid `k` values is incorrect. It should iterate over the range and count all valid `k` values, not just find the first one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        min_big = max(big)
        max_less = min(less)
        count = 0
        for k in range(min_big, max_less + 1):
            if k not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints.
