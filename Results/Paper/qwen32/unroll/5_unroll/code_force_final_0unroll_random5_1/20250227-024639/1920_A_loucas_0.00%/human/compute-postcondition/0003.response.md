Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. The integer `a` denotes the type of constraint (1: k must be greater than or equal to x, 2: k must be less than or equal to x, 3: k must not be equal to x). The function returns the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case.**
