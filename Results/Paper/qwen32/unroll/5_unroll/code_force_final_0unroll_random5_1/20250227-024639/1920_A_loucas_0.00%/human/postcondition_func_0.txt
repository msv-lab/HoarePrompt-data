The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines and prints an integer `k` that satisfies all the given constraints. Specifically, it finds an integer `k` that is greater than or equal to the maximum value specified by constraints of type 1, less than or equal to the minimum value specified by constraints of type 2, and not equal to any value specified by constraints of type 3.
