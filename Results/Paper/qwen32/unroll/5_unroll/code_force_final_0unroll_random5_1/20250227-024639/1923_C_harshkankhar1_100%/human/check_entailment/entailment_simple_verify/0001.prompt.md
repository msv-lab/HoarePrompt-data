You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. The array c is a list of n integers where each element c_i is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers read from the input where 1 <= `n`, `q` <= 3 * 10^5; the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers from `c`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1 and 2 based on the condition `a[j] > 1` for `j` from 1 to `i`.

    #State: The output state consists of `t` test cases, each with `n` integers in array `c`, `q` queries defined by pairs `(l_i, r_i)`, and the lists `a` and `b` computed as described. After executing the loop, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query, based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step in the context of the problem description:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array `c`) and `q` (number of queries).
   - It then reads the array `c` and initializes an array `a` with a leading zero for easier prefix sum calculations.
   - The array `b` is initialized with zeros and will be used to construct a hypothetical array `b` that meets the problem's conditions.

2. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates over the array `a` (starting from index 1) and sets each `b[i]` to be the sum of all previous `b[j]` (where `j < i`) plus a value `x`. 
   - The value `x` is set to `1` if `a[i] > 1`, otherwise `2`.
   - This construction ensures that `b[i]` is always positive and different from `a[i]` if `a[i] > 1`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program uses the `accumulate` function to compute the prefix sums of array `a`.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `x` and `y`.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray `c[x:y+1]` (calculated as `a[y] - a[x-1]`) is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` (calculated as `b[y] - b[x-1]`).
   - If the sum of the subarray in `c` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b`, or if `x == y` (meaning the subarray has only one element), it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues with the Program:
- **Condition for Good Subarray:** The program incorrectly assumes that the subarray `c[x:y+1]` is good if its sum is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. This is not the correct condition for the subarray to be good. The subarray is good if there exists a `b` such that the sum of `b` is equal to the sum of `c` and all elements in `b` are positive and different from `c`.
- **Single Element Subarrays:** The program correctly handles single element subarrays by checking if `x == y`, but the logic for determining if the subarray is good is flawed.
- **Array `b` Construction:** The construction of array `b` is not correct. The array `b` should be constructed in such a way that its sum is equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `c` and all elements are positive and different from `c`. The current construction does not guarantee this.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the program's logic and the incorrect construction of array `b`, the program is not correct.
