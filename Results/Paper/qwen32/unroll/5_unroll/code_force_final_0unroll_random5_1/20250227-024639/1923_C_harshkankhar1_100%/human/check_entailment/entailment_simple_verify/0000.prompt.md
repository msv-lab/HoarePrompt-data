You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    NO
    YES
    NO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. The array c is a list of n integers where each element c_i is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers read from the input where 1 <= `n`, `q` <= 3 * 10^5; the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers from `c`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1 and 2 based on the condition `a[j] > 1` for `j` from 1 to `i`.

    #State: The output state consists of `t` test cases, each with `n` integers in array `c`, `q` queries defined by pairs `(l_i, r_i)`, and the lists `a` and `b` computed as described. After executing the loop, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query, based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the condition that the subarray must have an integer array `b` such that the sum of `a` and `b` are equal, and all elements of `b` are positive and different from the corresponding elements of `a`.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The program calculates a prefix sum array `a` and another prefix sum array `b` where each element is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1 or not.
2. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if the subarray length is 1. If either condition is true, it prints "NO", otherwise it prints "YES".

The logic is flawed because it does not correctly ensure that the sum of the subarray in `a` can be matched by a corresponding subarray in `b` where all elements are positive and different from `a`.

Consider this counterexample:

Input:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
- The subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`.
- For this subarray, the sum is 3.
- To make a "good" array `b` such that `a[i] != b[i]` and `b[i] > 0`, we would need `b` to be something like `[2, 2, 2]` (sum = 6), `[2, 2, 3]` (sum = 7), etc., but none of these can match the sum of 3.
- The current program would incorrectly print "YES" because the sum of `a` (which is 3) is not less than the sum of `b` (which is 6), and the subarray length is not 1.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description.
