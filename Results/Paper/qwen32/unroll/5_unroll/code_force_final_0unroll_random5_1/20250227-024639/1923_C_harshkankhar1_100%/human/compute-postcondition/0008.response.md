Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries where each query is defined by integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function returns the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` inclusive. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with the total number of elements in all lists `c` and the total number of queries not exceeding 300,000.**
