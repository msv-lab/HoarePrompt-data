### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there are a few issues with the code that make it incorrect:

1. **Initialization of `soma` inside the loop**: The variable `soma` is initialized to 0 outside the loop that iterates over the test cases. However, it should be re-initialized to 0 at the beginning of each test case to ensure the sum is computed correctly for each individual test case. Currently, the `soma` variable is accumulating the sum across all test cases, which is incorrect.

2. **Loop range**: The outer loop should iterate `N` times, where `N` is the number of test cases, but it currently iterates `N` times for each test case, which is incorrect. The loop should iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases, as specified in the input.

3. **Inner loop range**: The inner loop should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive), not from 0 to `n-1`. The current code iterates from 0 to `n-1`, which means it is summing the digits of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, not from 1 to `n`.

4. **Output**: The program should print the result for each test case immediately after computing it, not accumulate the results and print them all at the end.

Here's the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Correctness: **False**
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected version should be used to achieve the correct output for each test case.
