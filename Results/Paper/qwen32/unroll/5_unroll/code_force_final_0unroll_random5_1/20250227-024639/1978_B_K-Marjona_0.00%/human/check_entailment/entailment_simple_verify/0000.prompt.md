You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.

        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each representing the total cost of selling n buns given the usual price a and the modified price b for the first k buns, where k is the minimum of n and the difference between b and a. If b is less than or equal to a, the total cost is simply n multiplied by a. Otherwise, the total cost is calculated as the sum of the arithmetic series for the first k buns at the modified price plus the cost of the remaining (n-k) buns at the usual price.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and check if it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Determine the Optimal `k`**:
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between the modified price of the first bun and the usual price.

3. **Calculate Maximum Profit**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

Let's verify if the program correctly handles all potential cases:

- **Case 1: `b <= a`**
  - The program correctly returns `a * n` in this scenario, which is the profit from selling all buns at the usual price.

- **Case 2: `b > a`**
  - The program calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and ending at `(b - k + 1)`, and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at `a`.
  - The formula used for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence is `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`, which is correct.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's test the program with the provided example cases:

1. **Input**: `4 4 5`
   - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit = `(5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) // 2 * 1 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Correct

2. **Input**: `5 5 9`
   - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
   - Profit = `(9 + (9 - 4 + 1)) // 2 * 4 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 35`
   - Correct

3. **Input**: `10 10 5`
   - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative)
   - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Correct

4. **Input**: `5 5 11`
   - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit = `(11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45`
   - Correct

5. **Input**: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Correct

6. **Input**: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Correct

7. **Input**: `1000 1 1000`
   - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit = `(1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1)) // 2 * 999 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 500500`
   - Correct

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided example cases and adheres to the problem description for all potential cases. There are no edge cases that the program fails to address.

**Correctness: True**

The program is correct as it accurately computes the maximum profit for all test cases according to the problem description.
