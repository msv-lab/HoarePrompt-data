In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that we do not need to consider for the state before the loop starts. The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `t`.

The state before the loop starts is provided as `t` being an integer input with the constraint 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is the number of iterations for the loop, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes, as it already satisfies the condition of being at least 1.

However, since the task specifies that we need to adhere strictly to the format and consider only the objects mentioned in the loop head, and `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we can confirm that `t` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is the integer input provided, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
