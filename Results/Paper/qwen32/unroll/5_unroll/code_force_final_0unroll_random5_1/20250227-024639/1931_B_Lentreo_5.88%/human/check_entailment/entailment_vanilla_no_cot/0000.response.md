Correctness: **False**

The logic in the provided program is incorrect. The program is intended to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any i-th container to any j-th container where i < j. However, the current implementation does not correctly implement this logic.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. The program calculates `curr` by summing up the differences between each element in `nums` and the last element `last`. This does not correctly reflect the condition needed to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

2. The program checks if `curr` is equal to 0 to determine if the water can be evenly distributed. This condition is not sufficient or correct for the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if we can redistribute the water such that each container has the same amount of water. This can be done by checking if the prefix sum of the containers' water amounts can always be adjusted to match the target amount (which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        target = total_sum // n
        prefix_sum = 0
        possible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            prefix_sum += nums[i]
            if prefix_sum > (i + 1) * target:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the prefix sum of the water amounts and check if at any point the prefix sum exceeds the expected sum if the water were evenly distributed up to that point. If it does, it is not possible to redistribute the water evenly, and we print "NO". Otherwise, we print "YES".
