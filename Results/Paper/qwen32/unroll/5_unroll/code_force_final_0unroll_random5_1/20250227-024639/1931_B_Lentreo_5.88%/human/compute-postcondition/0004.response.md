Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if a specific condition is met (related to the sum of the elements in the list relative to the last element) and prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.**
