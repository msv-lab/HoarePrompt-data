Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value for each test case, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, based on typical problem constraints, it is likely that the function computes and returns a specific value derived from the list `a` for each test case, such as an average or a specific sum, given that the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`.**
