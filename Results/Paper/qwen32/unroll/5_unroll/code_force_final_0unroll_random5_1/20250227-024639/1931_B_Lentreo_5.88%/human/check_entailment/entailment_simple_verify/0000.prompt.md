You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed and does not properly account for the conditions required to equalize the water levels in all containers.

Let's analyze the given program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `curr`:** The program calculates `curr` by iterating through `nums` and adding `i - last` for each non-zero `i`. This does not correctly check if the water can be evenly distributed. The logic should instead ensure that the cumulative sum of water levels up to any point can be adjusted to the average level.

2. **Ignoring the Average Level:** The problem requires that the sum of water levels is divisible by `n`, meaning each container should ideally have `total_sum / n` units of water. The program does not calculate or use this average level to check if the water can be distributed correctly.

3. **No Handling of Prefix Sums:** The correct approach involves using prefix sums and checking if the cumulative difference can be adjusted to reach the average level for all containers.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Calculate the target level of water for each container, which is `total_sum / n`.
- Use prefix sums to check if the cumulative difference can be adjusted to reach this target level.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        target = total_sum // n
        prefix_sum = 0
        can_equalize = True
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += nums[i]
            if prefix_sum % n != (target * (i + 1)) % n:
                can_equalize = False
                break
        print('YES' if can_equalize else 'NO')

# Example input handling
func()
```

This corrected program correctly checks if the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring that the prefix sums align with the expected cumulative target levels.
