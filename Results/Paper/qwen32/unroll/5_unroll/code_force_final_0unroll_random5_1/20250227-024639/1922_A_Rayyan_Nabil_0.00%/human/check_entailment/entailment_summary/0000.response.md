### Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program's logic is flawed in the following ways:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks if each character in `c` is different from the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`. However, the problem requires a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not match it. The matching rules are:
   - If the template character is lowercase, the corresponding string character must be the same.
   - If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding string character must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

2. **Logic Error in the Loop**: The loop iterates over each character and sets `l` to 'YES' if the condition is met for that character. However, it does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not. The `else` block after the `for` loop sets `l` to 'NO' only if the loop completes without setting `l` to 'YES'. This is incorrect because it does not consider the overall matching condition across all characters.

3. **Output Logic**: The output should be 'YES' if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it and `c` does not. The current program's logic does not ensure this condition is met.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
