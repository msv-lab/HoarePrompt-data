You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: the value of `l` after the last iteration of the outer loop, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the input strings `a`, `b`, and `c` in the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length. For each test case, it checks if each character in string `c` matches at least one of the corresponding characters in strings `a` or `b`. If this condition is met for all characters in `c`, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n`, and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic to Determine the Template:**
   - The program initializes a variable `l` with the value `'YES'`.
   - It then iterates over each character index `i` from `0` to `n-1` for the current test case.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the `i`-th character of `a` and `b` are different from the `i`-th character of `c`. If this condition holds for any character index, it sets `l` to `'YES'`.
   - However, the `else` clause of the `for` loop is incorrectly placed. The `else` clause of a `for` loop in Python is executed only if the loop completes normally (i.e., not terminated by a `break` statement). Since the loop always completes normally (there's no `break`), `l` will always be set to `'NO'` after the loop, regardless of the condition inside the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `l` for each test case.

### Issues with the Program:
- The logic to determine the template is flawed. Specifically, the `else` clause of the `for` loop results in the program always printing `'NO'` for each test case, regardless of whether a valid template exists.
- The correct approach would be to check if there exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If such an index exists, then a valid template exists, and the program should print `'YES'`. Otherwise, it should print `'NO'`.

### Correctness:
Based on the analysis, the given program is incorrect because it does not properly determine whether a valid template exists. It incorrectly always prints `'NO'` for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
