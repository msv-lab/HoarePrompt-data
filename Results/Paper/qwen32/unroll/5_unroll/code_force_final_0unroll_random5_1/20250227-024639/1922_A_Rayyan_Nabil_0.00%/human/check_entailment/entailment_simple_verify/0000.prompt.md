You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: the value of `l` after the last iteration of the outer loop, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the input strings `a`, `b`, and `c` in the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the match.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and why the code is incorrect:

1. **Logic Issue**: The code currently sets `l` to 'YES' as soon as it finds a single position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, it does not ensure that for all positions `i`, the conditions of the template matching are satisfied. Specifically, it should check that:
   - For all positions `i`, if the template character is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match the template character, and `c[i]` must not.
   - For all positions `i`, if the template character is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must differ from the lowercase version of the template character, and `c[i]` must match the lowercase version of the template character.

2. **Template Construction**: The code does not actually construct or check a template `t`. Instead, it only checks if there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. This is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

3. **Output Issue**: The code sets `l` to 'YES' if the condition is met for at least one position, but it should only print 'YES' if the condition is met for all positions. Additionally, the `else` block is incorrectly placed and will overwrite `l` to 'NO' if the last position does not meet the condition, which is not the correct logic.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                # If a[i] and b[i] are the same, they must be different from c[i]
                if a[i] == c[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            else:
                # If a[i] and b[i] are different, we can choose a template character
                # that matches a[i] or b[i] but not c[i]
                if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
        print("YES" if valid else "NO")

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for all positions and determines if a valid template exists.
