arr is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of each test case is the integer n, followed by the list a, and then the list b.
