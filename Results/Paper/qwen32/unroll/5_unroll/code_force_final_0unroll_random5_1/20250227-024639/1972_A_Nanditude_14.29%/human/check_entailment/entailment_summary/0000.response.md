Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of new problems to propose so that the difficulty of each problem `a_i` is less than or equal to the expected difficulty `b_i`. However, the given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

The main issues with the program are:
1. The program attempts to insert values from `b` into `a` instead of choosing new problem difficulties `w` that are not necessarily elements of `b`.
2. The logic to remove the most difficult problem and insert a new one is incorrect. The program is trying to insert `b[j]` directly into `a` at position `i` and then removing the last element, which is not the correct procedure.
3. The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the code, and it seems to be irrelevant to the problem.

The correct approach should involve:
- Iterating through both lists `a` and `b`.
- Comparing the current difficulties in `a` and `b`.
- If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, increment the count of new problems and "virtually" insert a new problem with difficulty less than or equal to `b[i]` by considering the next possible difficulty.
- Remove the most difficult problem from `a` by effectively reducing the size of the considered list.

The provided code does not follow this logic, and hence it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
