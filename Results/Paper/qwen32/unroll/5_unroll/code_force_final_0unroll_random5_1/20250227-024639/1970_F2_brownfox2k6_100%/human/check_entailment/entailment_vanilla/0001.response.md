Let's analyze the provided Python code snippet in the context of the problem description. The code snippet includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which handle different aspects of the game logic. However, the code provided is incomplete and does not cover the entire logic required to solve the problem.

### Function 1: `func_1(obj, d)`

This function is responsible for moving an object (which could be a player, a ball, or any entity) in one of the four directions: up ('U'), down ('D'), left ('L'), or right ('R'). The function modifies the position of the object by changing its coordinates based on the direction.

**Analysis:**
- This function correctly handles the movement of an object on the grid.
- It assumes that `obj` is a list or array that contains the current position of the object as `[row, column]`.
- The function does not check if the move is valid (i.e., whether the object stays within the bounds of the grid), but the problem description states that all actions are guaranteed to be valid, so this is acceptable.

### Function 2: `func_2(t)`

This function checks if any player has been eliminated by the Bludger. If a player is on the same cell as the Bludger, they are eliminated, and their position is set to `[-1, -1]` (off the grid). The function then prints the elimination event for each eliminated player in alphabetical order.

**Analysis:**
- The function iterates over all players and checks if their position matches the position of the Bludger.
- If a player is eliminated, their position is updated to `[-1, -1]`, and an elimination event is printed.
- The function sorts the list of eliminated players before printing to ensure that the events are printed in alphabetical order.

### Missing Logic

The provided code snippet does not include the following critical parts of the game logic:

1. **Initialization of the Field and Entities:**
   - The code does not initialize the field based on the input.
   - It does not track the positions of the Quaffle, Bludgers, goals, and players.

2. **Handling Player Actions:**
   - The code does not process the actions of players, such as moving, catching, or throwing the Quaffle.
   - It does not update the field based on these actions.

3. **Scoring Points:**
   - The code does not handle the logic for scoring points when a player places the Quaffle in a goal.
   - It does not keep track of the scores for the red and blue teams.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The code does not print the final score at the end of the game.

### Conclusion

The provided code snippet is incomplete and does not fully implement the required logic to solve the problem. While `func_1` correctly handles the movement of objects and `func_2` correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger, the rest of the game logic is missing.

**Correctness: False**

The code snippet is not sufficient to solve the problem as described. Additional functions and logic are required to handle the initialization of the game, processing of player actions, scoring points, and printing the final score.
