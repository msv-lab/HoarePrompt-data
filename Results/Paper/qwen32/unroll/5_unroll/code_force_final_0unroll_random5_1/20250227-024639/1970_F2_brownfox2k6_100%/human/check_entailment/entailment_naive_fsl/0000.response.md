Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code snippets `func_1` and `func_2` are incomplete and do not cover the full requirements of the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Code**:
   - The code does not handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle, which is a crucial part of the game.
   - It does not handle the scoring mechanism when a player puts the Quaffle in a goal.
   - The code does not manage the field state or the positions of the players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - There is no initialization of the field or the players' positions.

2. **Specific Issues**:
   - `func_1` only handles the movement of an object based on the direction provided (U, D, L, R). It does not account for the boundaries of the field or the interactions with other entities.
   - `func_2` checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them. However, it does not handle the case where the player is carrying the Quaffle, which should not be eliminated when on the same cell as the Bludger.
   - The code does not handle the case where a player scores a goal or scores in their own goal.
   - There is no mechanism to reset the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect. Here is a potential case where the code does not work as expected:

**Input**:
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T
```

**Expected Output**:
```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

**Actual Output**:
The code will not produce the expected output as it does not handle the Quaffle, scoring, or field state.

Thus, the code is incorrect.
