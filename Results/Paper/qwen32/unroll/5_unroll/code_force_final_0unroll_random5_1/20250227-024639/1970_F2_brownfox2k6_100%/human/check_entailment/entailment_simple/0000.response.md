### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to simulate the game of Quidditch according to the problem description. Let's break down the code and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field `N` and `M`.
   - It then reads the field grid and identifies the positions of goals, players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - It initializes the score for both teams (`rs` for red and `bs` for blue) and a variable `carry` to track which player is carrying the Quaffle.

2. **Processing Actions:**
   - For each action in the input, the program performs the following:
     - **Catch (`C`):** If a player catches the Quaffle, it sets the `carry` variable to that player's identifier.
     - **Throw (`T`):** If a player throws the Quaffle, it sets the `carry` variable to `None`. It then checks if the Quaffle is at a goal and updates the score accordingly. The Quaffle is then moved back to the middle of the field.
     - **Movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`):** If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, it moves the entity in the specified direction using `func_1`. If the entity is a player, it also checks for elimination using `func_2` and updates the Quaffle's position if the player is carrying it.
   
3. **Elimination Check:**
   - `func_2` checks if any player is at the same position as the Bludger. If so, it marks those players as eliminated by setting their position to `[-1, -1]` and prints the elimination event.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the score events and elimination events in the correct order.
   - Finally, it prints the final score of the game.

### Verification:
- The program correctly initializes the field and entities.
- It processes each action as described, updating positions and scores accordingly.
- It handles the elimination of players when they encounter the Bludger.
- The output format matches the problem description, with events printed in the correct order and the final score printed at the end.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the game of Quidditch according to the problem description and the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
