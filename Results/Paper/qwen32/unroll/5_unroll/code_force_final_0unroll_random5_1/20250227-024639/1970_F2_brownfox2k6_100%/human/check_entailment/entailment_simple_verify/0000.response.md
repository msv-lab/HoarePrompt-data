### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the code and the annotations provided to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The field is a rectangle with goals, players, a Quaffle, and optionally a Bludger.
- Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw it to score points by putting it in the opponent's goal.
- The Quaffle resets to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
- Players can be eliminated if they come into contact with the Bludger.
- The output should log each goal and elimination event, and the final score at the end.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The field is correctly parsed, and initial positions of goals, players, Quaffle, and Bludger are stored.
   - The `player` dictionary holds player identifiers as keys and their positions as values.
   - `rg` and `bg` lists store the positions of red and blue goals, respectively.
   - `blud` stores the position of the Bludger.
   - `ball` stores the position of the Quaffle.
   - `carry` is initialized to `None` to represent no player carrying the Quaffle.
   - `bs` and `rs` are initialized to `0` to keep track of blue and red scores, respectively.

2. **Processing Actions**:
   - For each action, the program checks the type of action (move, catch, throw).
   - **Move (U, D, L, R)**:
     - Players and the Bludger can move.
     - `func_1` is used to update positions based on the direction.
     - After moving, `func_2` checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them.
   - **Catch (C)**:
     - A player catches the Quaffle if they are on the same cell as it.
     - `carry` is updated to the player's identifier.
   - **Throw (T)**:
     - The player throws the Quaffle, so `carry` is set to `None`.
     - If the Quaffle is in a red goal, the blue team scores.
     - If the Quaffle is in a blue goal, the red team scores.
     - The Quaffle is reset to the center of the field.

3. **Elimination Handling**:
   - `func_2` checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them.
   - Players are sorted alphabetically before being eliminated to meet the requirement of output order.

4. **Scoring**:
   - When a goal is scored, the appropriate team's score is incremented.
   - The event is logged with the current time step.

5. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all actions, the final score is printed.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the states of the program before and after function calls.
- They confirm that the Bludger and players move as expected.
- They also confirm that players are eliminated correctly when they come into contact with the Bludger.
- The scoring and Quaffle reset mechanisms are correctly described.

#### Validation Against Examples:
- **Example 1**:
  - The red player scores in the blue goal, resulting in "11 BLUE GOAL" and a final score of "FINAL SCORE: 0 1".
  - The code correctly handles the Quaffle, scoring, and field state.
- **Example 2**:
  - The red player scores in their own goal, resulting in "4 BLUE GOAL" and a final score of "FINAL SCORE: 0 1".
  - The code correctly handles the Quaffle, scoring, and field state.
- **Example 3**:
  - Players are eliminated by the Bludger, resulting in "2 R0 ELIMINATED" and "4 B0 ELIMINATED" with a final score of "FINAL SCORE: 0 0".
  - The code correctly handles the Bludger and player elimination.

### Conclusion:
The provided code and annotations correctly implement the problem description. It handles all the required actions, scoring, and elimination events, and produces the expected output for the given examples.

**Final: **True**
