### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm first constructs a string `r` consisting of all distinct letters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order. Then, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` with the encoded string `b` to decode it.
4. The function `func_1`:
   - Finds all unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - Creates a mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - Constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped character from `char_map`.
5. The decoded strings are then printed as the output.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and the example provided. The function correctly identifies the unique characters, sorts them, creates the mapping, and decodes the string. The execution summary confirms that the function is performing the intended operations correctly.

### Correctness: **True**
