### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an encoded string `b` that was produced by replacing each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`.
   - The string `r` is constructed from the distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character `c` in `s` is replaced by `r[len(r) - 1 - r.index(c)]` in `b`.

2. **Understanding the Solution:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string `n` and the string `b` itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.
   - The function `func_1`:
     - Extracts the unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
     - Creates a mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
     - Uses this mapping to decode `b` into the original string `s`.

3. **Verifying the Solution:**
   - The solution correctly identifies the unique characters in `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
   - It then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to reconstruct the original string `s` from `b`.

4. **Checking the Example:**
   - For the input `serofedsoc`, the unique characters sorted in alphabetical order form `r = cdefors`.
   - The mapping created is: `c -> s`, `d -> r`, `e -> o`, `f -> e`, `o -> e`, `r -> d`, `s -> c`.
   - Using this mapping, `serofedsoc` is decoded to `codeforces`.

5. **Generalization:**
   - The logic used in the program is consistent with the problem statement and works for all given examples and test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
