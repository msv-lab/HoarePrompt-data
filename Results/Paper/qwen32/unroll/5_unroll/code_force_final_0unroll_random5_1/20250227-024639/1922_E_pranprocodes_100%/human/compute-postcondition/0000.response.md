In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates based on the integer input received from the user. The loop variable is `i`, and the range is determined by `int(input())`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, the input to the `range` function must be a positive integer. Given the context, the input to the loop is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Since `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), it is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute. The variable `X` mentioned in the problem statement is not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
