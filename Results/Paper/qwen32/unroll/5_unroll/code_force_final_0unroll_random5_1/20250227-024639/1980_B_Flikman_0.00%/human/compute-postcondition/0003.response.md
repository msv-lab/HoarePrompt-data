Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `f`, and `k` where `n` is the number of elements in a list `a`, `f` and `k` are additional integers. It also accepts a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
