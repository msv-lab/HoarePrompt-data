You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and guarantees it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns the same string `s` unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Sorting Criteria**: The sorting criteria in the code is `key=lambda x: x[1]`, which sorts the items based on prefix balance. However, the problem description specifies that ties in prefix balance should be broken by position in decreasing order. The code does not account for this tie-breaking rule.

2. **Incorrect Dictionary Keys**: The dictionary `d` uses positions as keys, but the sorting and subsequent string construction depend on the values (prefix balances) and their order. The dictionary should be sorted first by prefix balance and then by position in decreasing order, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

3. **Incorrect Dictionary Initialization and Usage**: The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect sorting if not handled properly. The dictionary should only store the prefix balances and their corresponding positions.

Here is an example where the code does not work as expected:

**Input**:
```
(()(()))
```

**Expected Output**:
```
()(()())
```

**Actual Output**:
The actual output may vary but is not guaranteed to be `()(()())` due to the issues mentioned above.

To correct the program, the sorting should be adjusted to handle the tie-breaking rule correctly, and the dictionary should be used properly to store and sort the prefix balances and their positions. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    d = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        d.append((balance, -(i + 1), s[i]))  # Store balance, negative position, and character
    
    # Sort by balance, then by position in decreasing order (hence negative position)
    d.sort()
    
    ans = ''.join(char for _, _, char in d)
    return ans

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version ensures that the sorting respects the tie-breaking rule by using negative positions.
