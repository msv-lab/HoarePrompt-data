The code snippet assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Given that `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, the length `n` will be a positive integer.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
