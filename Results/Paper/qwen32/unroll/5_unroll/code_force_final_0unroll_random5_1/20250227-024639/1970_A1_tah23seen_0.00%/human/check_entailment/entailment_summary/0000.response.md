Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence. However, based on the execution summary, the function `func_1` does not perform the required operations and instead returns the input string unchanged. The balanced shuffle involves creating a table of prefix balances, sorting it based on specific criteria, and constructing a new sequence from the sorted table. The provided code does not follow these steps correctly and thus does not produce the expected output.

Given the execution summary, it is clear that the program does not perform the balanced shuffle as described in the problem statement, but instead returns the input string directly. This means the program is not correct according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
