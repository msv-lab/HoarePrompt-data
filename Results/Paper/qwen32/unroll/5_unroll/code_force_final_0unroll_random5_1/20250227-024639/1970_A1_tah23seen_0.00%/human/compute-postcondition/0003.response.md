Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the key `0` mapped to the value `0`.**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated to include the key `0` with the value `0`. All other variables (`s`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
