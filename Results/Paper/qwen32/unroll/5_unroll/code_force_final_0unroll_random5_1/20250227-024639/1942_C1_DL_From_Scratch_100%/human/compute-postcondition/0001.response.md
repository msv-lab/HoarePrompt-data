The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) do not affect the execution of the loop directly and are not part of the loop head.

To ensure the loop executes, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that y = 0; The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
