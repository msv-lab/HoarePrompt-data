test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.
