Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The program assumes that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, which is consistent with the problem description. Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
3. It then checks which two x-coordinates are the same, indicating that these corners form one side of the square. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the other two corners will have the same x-coordinate as the other pair.
4. It calculates the length of the side of the square by taking the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the corners that share the same x-coordinate.
5. It then calculates the area by squaring the side length.
6. Finally, it prints the area for each test case.

The program correctly handles the given example inputs and produces the expected outputs. It checks all possible pairs of corners to find the side length, ensuring that it correctly identifies the side of the square regardless of the order of the input coordinates.

Correctness: **True**
