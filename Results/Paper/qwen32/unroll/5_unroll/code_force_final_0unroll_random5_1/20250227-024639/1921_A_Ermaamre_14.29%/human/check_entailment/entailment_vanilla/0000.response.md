Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the area of the square based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers, representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.

2. **Logic to Determine Side Length:**
   - The program attempts to determine the side length of the square by checking different pairs of x-coordinates.
   - It checks three possible pairs of x-coordinates:
     - `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`
     - `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`
     - `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`
   - For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference in the y-coordinates to determine the side length.

3. **Calculation of Area:**
   - Once the side length is determined, it squares this value to get the area of the square and prints it.

### Correctness Check:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic to determine the side length is based on the assumption that two of the x-coordinates will be the same for the vertical sides of the square, and the other two will be the same for the horizontal sides.
  - The program correctly identifies the side length by calculating the absolute difference in y-coordinates when two x-coordinates are the same.
  - The area is correctly calculated by squaring the side length.

- **Handling Different Test Cases:**
  - The program handles multiple test cases by iterating through the number of test cases specified by the input.
  - It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program should correctly handle squares of different sizes and positions on the coordinate plane, including squares with negative coordinates.
  - The problem guarantees that the input will always form a valid square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, so the program does not need to handle invalid inputs.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the side length of the square and calculates the area based on the given coordinates. It handles multiple test cases and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
