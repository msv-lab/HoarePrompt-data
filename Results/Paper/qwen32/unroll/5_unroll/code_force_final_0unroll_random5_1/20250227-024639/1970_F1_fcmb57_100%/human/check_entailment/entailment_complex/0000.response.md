### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem's requirements.

1. **Initialization and Parsing Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the dimensions of the field `N` and `M`.
   - It parses the field to identify the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It initializes dictionaries and lists to store the positions of players and goals, as well as the movement directions.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The code reads the number of moves `T` and processes each move.
   - For movement actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it correctly updates the player's position by calling `func_1`.
   - For catching actions (`C`), it is not implemented in the provided code, which is fine as the problem guarantees that all actions are valid and this action does not affect the final score or goal scoring.
   - For throwing actions (`T`), it checks if the player's position is on a goal of the opposite team and updates the score accordingly. It also prints the correct event message when a goal is scored.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly updates the position of a player based on the movement direction.

4. **Output:**
   - The code prints the correct event messages whenever a goal is scored.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final score in the required format.

### Issues:
- The comment for `func_1` incorrectly states that the return value is `(x + dx, y + dy)`, which is `(a + b, a + b)`. This is a mistake in the comment, not in the function implementation itself.
- The function `func_1` is correctly implemented and used.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the problem's requirements and handles the input and output as specified. The only issue is a mistake in the comment for `func_1`, but this does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
**Correctness: True**
