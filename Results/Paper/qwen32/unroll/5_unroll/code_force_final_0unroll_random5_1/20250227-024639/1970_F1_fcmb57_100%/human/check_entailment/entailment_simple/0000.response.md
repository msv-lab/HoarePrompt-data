### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and its logic to see if it correctly implements the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field `N` and `M`.
   - It then reads the field configuration, storing the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It reads the number of moves `T` and the subsequent actions.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move, it checks if the action is a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), catching a ball (`C`), or throwing the Quaffle (`T`).
   - For movements, it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function, which correctly calculates the new position based on the direction.
   - For throwing the Quaffle (`T`), it checks if the player's position is on a goal of the opposing team and updates the score accordingly.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the time and the team that scores a goal.
   - Finally, it prints the final score.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the new position of a player after a movement.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Condition Handling for Scoring:**
  - The program uses two separate `if` statements to check if the player is on a goal of the opposing team. This means that if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, both `if` conditions will evaluate to `False`, and no point will be awarded. However, according to the problem statement, if a player scores in their own goal, the other team wins a point.
  - To fix this, the program should use an `if-elif` structure or check the conditions in a single `if` statement with a logical condition to determine the correct team that scores.

### Corrected Logic:
The logic for scoring should be:
- If the player is on a goal of the opposing team, the opposing team scores.
- If the player is on a goal of their own team, the opposing team scores.

### Corrected Code Snippet:
```python
if mo[1] == 'T':
    if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
        pointsb += 1
        print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
    elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
        pointsr += 1
        print(i, 'RED GOAL')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. Therefore, it is not fully correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
