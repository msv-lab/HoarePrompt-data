Let's analyze the provided Python program based on the problem description.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Movement Handling:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to handle the movement of players, but the function is not defined before its use. The function definition is at the end of the code, which is not a problem in Python, but it's good practice to define functions before using them.
   - The movement handling in `func_1` is correct in terms of adding the movement vector to the player's current position.

2. **Ball Handling:**
   - The program does not handle the Quaffle's position correctly. The Quaffle should move with the player who catches it and should return to the center of the field when a goal is scored.
   - The program does not track who is carrying the Quaffle, which is necessary to determine if a player can throw it.

3. **Goal Scoring:**
   - The program checks if a player is on a goal position to score points. However, it does not account for whether the player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Output:**
   - The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. It should print the name of the team who wins one point in that case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where there are multiple goals for each team. It assumes there is only one goal per team, which is not guaranteed by the problem description.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as it does not fully implement the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. It does not correctly handle the Quaffle's position, ball carrying, and goal scoring.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
