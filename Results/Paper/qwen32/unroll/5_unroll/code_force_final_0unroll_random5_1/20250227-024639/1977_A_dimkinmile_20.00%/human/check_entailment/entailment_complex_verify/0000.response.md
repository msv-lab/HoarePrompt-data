### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided code is incorrect and provides a counterexample where `n = 3` and `m = 0` should result in "Yes" but the code outputs "No". However, let's carefully re-examine the problem and the code.

The problem specifies that in one move, Nikita can either add exactly 1 cube or remove exactly 1 cube. For the final tower to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:

1. **If `n >= m`**: It is possible to add `m` cubes one by one in `m` moves, and use the remaining `(n - m)` moves to either do nothing (if `(n - m)` is even) or to add and then remove a cube in pairs (if `(n - m)` is even).

2. **If `n < m`**: It is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves because each move can only add or remove one cube.

The original code correctly handles the condition `n >= m`. However, it does not consider the parity of `(n - m)`. The original assessment is correct in pointing out that the code should also check if `(n - m)` is even to ensure that the remaining moves can be used in valid pairs.

Given the annotations, the function `func_1` does not account for the parity condition:

```python
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
```

The annotations confirm that the function checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly. However, they do not mention the parity check, which is necessary for the correct logic.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the code is incorrect because it does not account for the parity of `(n - m)`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
