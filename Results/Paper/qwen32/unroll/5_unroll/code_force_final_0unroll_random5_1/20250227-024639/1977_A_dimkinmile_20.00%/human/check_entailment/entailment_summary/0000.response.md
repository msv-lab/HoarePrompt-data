Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the number of cubes `m` in the final tower. However, this approach is flawed. The correct logic should consider that `n` moves can result in a tower with `m` cubes if and only if `n - m` is even (because each pair of add and remove operations cancels each other out, and the remaining operations must be additions if `n - m` is positive and even).

The current program does not correctly implement this logic. It simply checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is insufficient. For example, if `n` is 2 and `m` is 1, the program will output "Yes", but it's not possible to have exactly 1 cube after 2 moves since the operations must balance out in pairs.

Correctness: **False**
