The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `balances`), but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value to be printed is not dependent on these variables.

Let's break down the information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

However, the `print` statement is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`.

Output: **Yes**
