Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine if it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing one cube. The logic in the program is flawed. 

In the program, the condition `if n >= m:` is used to decide whether the output should be "Yes" or "No". This condition does not correctly capture the problem's requirements. Specifically, the number of moves `n` must be sufficient to reach `m` cubes, considering that moves can be additions or removals.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because:
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, Nikita can add cubes until he reaches `m` cubes.
- If `n` is less than `m`, Nikita can first remove cubes (if necessary) and then add cubes to reach `m` cubes.
- However, the total number of moves `n` must be able to cover both additions and removals. This means that the difference `n - m` (or `m - n` if `m > n`) must be even, as each addition or removal counts as one move.

For example:
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita can remove 2 cubes (2 moves) and then add 3 cubes (3 moves), totaling 5 moves.
- If `n = 3` and `m = 4`, Nikita can add 4 cubes (4 moves), but this exceeds the allowed 3 moves, so it's not possible.

The given program does not account for this requirement and will incorrectly output "Yes" for cases where `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, regardless of whether the difference is even.

Correctness: **False**
