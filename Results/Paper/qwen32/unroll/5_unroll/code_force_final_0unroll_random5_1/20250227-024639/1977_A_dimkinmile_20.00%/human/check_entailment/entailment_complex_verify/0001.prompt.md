You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, compares them, and prints "Yes" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints "No". It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine if it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing one cube. The logic in the program is flawed. 

In the program, the condition `if n >= m:` is used to decide whether the output should be "Yes" or "No". This condition does not correctly capture the problem's requirements. Specifically, the number of moves `n` must be sufficient to reach `m` cubes, considering that moves can be additions or removals.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because:
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, Nikita can add cubes until he reaches `m` cubes.
- If `n` is less than `m`, Nikita can first remove cubes (if necessary) and then add cubes to reach `m` cubes.
- However, the total number of moves `n` must be able to cover both additions and removals. This means that the difference `n - m` (or `m - n` if `m > n`) must be even, as each addition or removal counts as one move.

For example:
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita can remove 2 cubes (2 moves) and then add 3 cubes (3 moves), totaling 5 moves.
- If `n = 3` and `m = 4`, Nikita can add 4 cubes (4 moves), but this exceeds the allowed 3 moves, so it's not possible.

The given program does not account for this requirement and will incorrectly output "Yes" for cases where `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, regardless of whether the difference is even.

Correctness: **False**
