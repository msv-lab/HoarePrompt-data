Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

The code checks for a specific pattern in the list `l` where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` and assumes that if this pattern is found, the answer is 2. If this pattern is not found, it assumes the answer is 3. This is not a general solution to the problem.

Let's consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of the expected output:
Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 2. Friend 1's best friend is 2 and friend 2's best friend is 3. Since both 1 and 2 are invited, friend 2 will come to the party. Similarly, since both 2 and 3 are invited, friend 3 will come to the party. Thus, at least 2 friends will come to the party, and the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output for this case. The code only checks for the pattern `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, which is not present in this input. Therefore, the code will incorrectly output 3 for this case.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
