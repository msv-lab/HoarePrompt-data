Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are processed to compute and print `A + B`, where `A = int(m/a) + 1` and `B = int(m/b) + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each of the `t` test cases are still to be processed, and the computations for `A` and `B` are yet to be performed.
