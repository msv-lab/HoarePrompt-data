Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, and outputs the length of a modified list of numbers and the numbers themselves. The list is initially composed of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\), modified by removing a specific power of 2 and adding three new numbers based on the value of `k`.**
