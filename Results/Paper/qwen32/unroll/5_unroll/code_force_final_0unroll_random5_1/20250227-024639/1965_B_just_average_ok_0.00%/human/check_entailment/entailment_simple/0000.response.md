### Reasoning:
The program provided aims to generate a sequence of non-negative integers that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Generating Powers of 2:**
   - The program starts by generating the first 24 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)) and storing them in the list `nums`. This is because the sum of the first 24 powers of 2 can represent all numbers up to \(2^{24} - 1\) uniquely using binary representation.

2. **Adjusting for the Value of k:**
   - The program then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. This is done by finding the index `idx` such that \(2^{idx} \le k < 2^{idx+1}\).
   - The program then removes \(2^{idx}\) from `nums` and adds three new numbers to `nums`:
     - `k - 2^{idx}`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + 2^{idx} + 1`

3. **Ensuring Conditions:**
   - By removing \(2^{idx}\) and adding `k - 2^{idx}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{idx} + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k`. This is because the sum `k` can no longer be formed by combining the elements in `nums`.
   - The program also ensures that all other numbers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can still be formed as a sum of a subsequence of `nums`. This is because the powers of 2 can represent all numbers up to \(2^{24} - 1\) uniquely, and the adjustments made do not disrupt this property for numbers other than `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case.

### Evaluation:
The logic of the program appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples. The program ensures that no subsequence of the generated sequence sums to `k` while still allowing all other numbers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) to be formed as a sum of a subsequence.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
