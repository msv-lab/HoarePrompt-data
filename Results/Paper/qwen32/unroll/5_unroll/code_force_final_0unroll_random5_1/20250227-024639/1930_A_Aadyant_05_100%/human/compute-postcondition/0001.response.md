Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(n) <= 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7; `final` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `final` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
