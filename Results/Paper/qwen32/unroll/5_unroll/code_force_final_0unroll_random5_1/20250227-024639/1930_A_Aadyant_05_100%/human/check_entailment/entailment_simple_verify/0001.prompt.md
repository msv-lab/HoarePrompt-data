You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

        print(fin)
        
    #State: Each element of the list `final` is printed on a new line. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the score by performing `n` moves on `2n` integers. Each move involves selecting two integers, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both from the list. The strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available integers together.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n`.
   - It reads the next line as a string and then splits it into a list of integers.
   - It sorts this list of integers.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first integer of each pair (which is the smaller one due to sorting) to the score.
   - It stores the final score for each test case in a list.
3. Finally, it prints the scores for all test cases.

### Issues in the Program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` but then incorrectly reads the next line as `a` (which is not used) and the following line as the list of integers. This is incorrect because it should read `n` and then directly the list of integers for each test case.
2. The variable `a` is read but not used. This can be removed.
3. The program reads the input as strings and converts them to integers multiple times unnecessarily. It can be simplified by directly reading and converting the integers in one go.
4. The program doesn't handle the input format correctly. For each test case, it should read `n` and then the list of `2n` integers.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list1.sort()
        s = sum(list1[i] for i in range(0, len(list1), 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper handling of input and unnecessary steps. The corrected version above should work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
