### Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem by following these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It sums the elements at even indices of the sorted list.
5. It prints the sum for each test case.

Let's analyze why this approach works:
- The problem requires maximizing the score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
- Sorting the list ensures that the smallest integers are paired together, which optimizes the score since the minimum of each pair will be as large as possible given the constraint of pairing the smallest numbers.
- By summing the elements at even indices of the sorted list, we effectively sum the minimum of each pair since the list is sorted.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy. It handles multiple test cases, sorts the list of integers for each test case, and sums the minimum of each pair by summing the elements at even indices. This is the optimal approach to maximize the score.
