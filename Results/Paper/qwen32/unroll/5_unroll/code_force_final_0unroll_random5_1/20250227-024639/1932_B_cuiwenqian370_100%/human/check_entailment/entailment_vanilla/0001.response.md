Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains a single integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains an integer `n` (number of signs).
     - The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (periodicities of the signs).
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Logic:**
   - The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
   - The signs must occur sequentially. If the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the (i+1)-th sign starting from year `x+1`.

### Solution Breakdown
The provided Python program reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The entire input is read at once and split into a list of strings.
   - The number of test cases `T` is extracted.
   - For each test case, the number of signs `n` is read, followed by the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The first sign occurs in the year `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, the year of its occurrence is calculated as:
     - `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`
     - This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Verification with Example
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `3`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
   - Year of 6th sign: `(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches expected output)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `1`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (matches expected output)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - All signs occur every year starting from 1.
   - Output: `5` (matches expected output)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - Year of 1st sign: `50`
   - Year of 2nd sign: `(50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60`
   - Year of 3rd sign: `(60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 771`
   - Year of 4th sign: `(771 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 1000`
   - Year of 5th sign: `(1000 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1512`
   - Year of 6th sign: `(1512 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (matches expected output)

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case based on the given periodicities and sequential occurrence requirement. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
