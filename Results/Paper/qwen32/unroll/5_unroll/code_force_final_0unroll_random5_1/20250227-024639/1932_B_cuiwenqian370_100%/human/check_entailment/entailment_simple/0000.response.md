Reasoning:  
The provided program reads the input correctly, processes each test case by calculating the year in which each sign occurs sequentially, and outputs the correct results based on the problem description. Let's break down the logic:

1. The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings (`data`).
2. It then iterates over the number of test cases (`T`), extracting the number of signs (`n`) and their respective periodicities (`a`).
3. For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity (`a[0]`).
4. It then iterates over the remaining signs, calculating the year the next sign will occur using the formula: `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
5. The `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
6. After processing all signs for a test case, the final `last_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) is appended to the `results` list.
7. Finally, the program outputs all results, one per line.

Based on the provided example and annotated program state, the program correctly calculates the year for each test case and outputs the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
