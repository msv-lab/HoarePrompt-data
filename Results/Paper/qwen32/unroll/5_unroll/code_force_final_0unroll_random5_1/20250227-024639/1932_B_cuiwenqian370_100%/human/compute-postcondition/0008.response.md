The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')`. This line of code will write the elements of the `results` list to the standard output, each on a new line, followed by an additional newline character.

Given the initial state, the `results` list is `["2", "5", "5"]`. The code will output these values with each on a new line and add an extra newline at the end.

The variables `data`, `input`, `index`, `T`, and `results` remain unchanged by this line of code since it only performs an output operation and does not modify any of these variables.

Output State: **`data` remains `["3", "2", "1", "2", "3", "2", "5"]`; `input` remains the entire input as provided; `index` is `7`; `T` remains `3`; `results` remains `["2", "5", "5"]`; the output to the standard output is `2\n5\n5\n`.**
