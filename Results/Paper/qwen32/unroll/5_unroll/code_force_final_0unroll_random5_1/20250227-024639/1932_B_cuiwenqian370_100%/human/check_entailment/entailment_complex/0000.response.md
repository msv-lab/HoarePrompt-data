### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases from the standard input, processing each test case to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, and then outputting the results.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings (`data`).
   - It then processes this data to extract the number of test cases (`T`) and the details for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the list of periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity (`a[0]`).
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the year the next sign will occur using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs after the previous sign's year and at a multiple of its periodicity.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to the standard output, with each result on a new line.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program's logic against the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Calculations:
     - `last_year = 3` (first sign)
     - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (second sign)
     - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (third sign)
     - `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (fourth sign)
     - `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (fifth sign)
     - `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (sixth sign)
   - Result: `36` (matches the example)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Calculations:
     - `last_year = 1` (first sign)
     - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2` (second sign)
     - `next_year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3` (third sign)
     - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4` (fourth sign)
     - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5` (fifth sign)
   - Result: `5` (matches the example)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Calculations:
     - `last_year = 1` (first sign)
     - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 2` (second sign)
     - `next_year = (2 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 3` (third sign)
     - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 4` (fourth sign)
     - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 5` (fifth sign)
   - Result: `5` (matches the example)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - Calculations:
     - `last_year = 50` (first sign)
     - `next_year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60` (second sign)
     - `next_year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 771` (third sign)
     - `next_year = (771 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 1000` (fourth sign)
     - `next_year = (1000 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1509` (fifth sign)
     - `next_year = (1509 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012` (sixth sign)
   - Result: `2012` (matches the example)

Since the program produces the correct output for all the provided test cases, it appears to be correctly implemented.
