Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` integers representing the periodicities of signs. For each test case, it calculates the year in which all signs will next flash simultaneously and writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.**
