You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is given in the first line of the input.

            last_year = next_year
        
        results.append(str(last_year))
        
    #State: - `data` remains `["3", "2", "1", "2", "3", "2", "5"]`.
    #- `input` remains the entire input as provided.
    #- `index` is `7` (since it has been incremented by `1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2`).
    #- `T` remains `3`.
    #- `results` is `["2", "5", "5"]`.
    #
    #Output State:
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` integers representing the periodicities of signs. For each test case, it calculates the year in which all signs will next flash simultaneously and writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the `last_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results separated by newlines.

The program handles all edge cases correctly:
- If there is only one sign, it simply returns the first sign's periodicity.
- If all signs have the same periodicity, it correctly calculates the year based on the sequence.
- If signs have different periodicities, it correctly waits for the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one.

The given examples in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program, which further confirms its correctness. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
