The provided code snippet is a function definition and a docstring, but it does not contain any executable code that modifies variables or performs operations. The function `Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s` is declared, but its implementation is missing. Therefore, no changes are made to the initial state.

Output State: **b is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of b is a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all strings b across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
