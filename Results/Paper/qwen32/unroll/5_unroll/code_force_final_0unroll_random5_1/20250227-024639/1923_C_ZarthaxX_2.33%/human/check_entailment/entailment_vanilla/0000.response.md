Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good". A subarray is considered good if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
2. No element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Key Observations
- For the subarray to be "good", it must be possible to create a `b` where each element `b_i` is different from `c_i` and positive.
- If a subarray contains all 1s, it cannot be "good" because there is no positive number other than 1 that can replace 1 while keeping the sum equal.
- For any other subarray, it can be "good" if the sum of the subarray minus the number of 1s is at least the number of elements minus the number of 1s. This ensures that we can create a `b` where each element is different from `c_i` and positive (by reducing the 1s to 2s and increasing other elements appropriately).

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ones[i]` keeps track of the number of 1s up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` keeps track of the sum of the subarray up to index `i-1` minus the number of 1s.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the adjusted sum in the specified range.
   - It then checks if the subarray can be "good" based on the conditions derived.

### Detailed Explanation of the Code
- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
  sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
      ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
      sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
  ```
  - `ones[i]` correctly tracks the number of 1s up to index `i-1`.
  - `sum[i]` correctly tracks the sum of elements up to index `i-1` minus the number of 1s.

- **Processing Each Query**:
  ```python
  for _ in range(q):
      (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
      if l == r:
          print('NO')
          continue
      onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
      sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
      if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
          print('YES')
      else:
          print('NO')
  ```
  - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the adjusted sum (`sumInRange`) in the range `[l, r]`.
  - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`. This condition checks if the subarray can be "good" based on the derived logic.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good". It efficiently precomputes necessary values and checks the conditions for each query.

**Correctness: True**
