Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits. However, the program contains logical errors that prevent it from functioning correctly.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop and Condition**: The loop `for p in range(1, len(list1)):` is designed to iterate through the list and check if the list is sorted. However, the condition `if not func_1(list1):` is checked before any operations are performed, which means that if the list is initially unsorted, the operations inside the loop will not be executed correctly. Additionally, the operations inside the loop are not guaranteed to make the list sorted in all cases.

2. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The operation to split a number into its digits is done incorrectly. The line `list1.insert(p, a % 10)` only inserts the last digit of the number, and `list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)` inserts the first digit, but this logic only works for two-digit numbers. For numbers with more than two digits, this approach will not work correctly.

3. **Lack of Iterative Splitting**: The program does not handle the case where multiple splits are needed to sort the array. It only attempts to split once per iteration, which is insufficient.

4. **Inefficient Sorting Check**: The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted, but it is called repeatedly without ensuring that all possible splits have been made. This means that the program may incorrectly determine that the list cannot be sorted when it actually can.

5. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The program should be able to output "YES" or "NO" in any case, but the current implementation outputs "Yes" and "No," which may not be accepted by the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
