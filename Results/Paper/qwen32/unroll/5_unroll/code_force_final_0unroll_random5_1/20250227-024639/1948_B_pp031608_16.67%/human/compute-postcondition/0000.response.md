Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive; `sorted_lst` is a new list containing the elements of `lst` in non-decreasing order.**

Explanation: The variable `sorted_lst` is created and assigned the value of `lst` sorted in non-decreasing order. The original list `lst` remains unchanged, and all other preconditions about `lst` still hold.
