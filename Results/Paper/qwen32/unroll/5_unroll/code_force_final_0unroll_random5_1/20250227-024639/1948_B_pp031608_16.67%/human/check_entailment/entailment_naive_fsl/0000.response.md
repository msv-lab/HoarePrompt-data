Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for sorting the array using the described operation. Specifically, the logic for splitting the numbers and checking if the array is sorted is flawed.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The code attempts to split a number only if the previous number is greater than the current number and greater than 10. However, this logic is too restrictive. It should consider splitting any number that is 10 or greater, not just when the previous number is greater than the current number.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Sorting Check**: The code checks if the array is sorted after each possible split operation, but it does not ensure that all possible splits are considered. The current implementation might miss cases where multiple splits are needed to achieve a sorted array.

3. **Incorrect Looping Mechanism**: The loop only checks for the need to split once per iteration, but it should continue to check and split numbers until no more splits are needed or the array becomes sorted.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 11 13 10
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this example, the program might not correctly handle the need to split `12` and `11` to achieve a sorted array. The correct approach would involve splitting numbers iteratively until no more splits are needed or the array becomes sorted.

To fix the program, a more comprehensive approach to splitting numbers and checking the array's sorted state would be necessary.
