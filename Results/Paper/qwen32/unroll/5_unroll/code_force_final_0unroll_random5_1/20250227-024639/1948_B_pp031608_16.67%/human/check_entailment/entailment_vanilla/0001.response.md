Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array of integers, and we can split any number that is at least 10 into its individual digits.
- The task is to determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-descending order by applying the above operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
- It then enters a loop where it checks if the array is already sorted using `func_1`.
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10.
- If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
- After attempting to sort the array, it checks again if the array is sorted and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop `for p in range(1, len(list1)):` only checks consecutive elements and performs the split operation based on that. This is not sufficient because the split operation can affect elements that are not immediate neighbors.
   - The loop should continue until the array is sorted or no more splits can be performed.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Splitting**:
   - The condition `if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:` checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10. However, it should check if any element is greater than 10 and can be split to potentially sort the array.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Splitting Logic**:
   - The program only attempts to split the first element that violates the sorted order. It should attempt to split any element that is at least 10 and see if it helps in sorting the array.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if the list is sorted. However, it is used incorrectly within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. The program's logic is too simplistic and does not account for all possible ways to split elements and achieve a sorted array.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
