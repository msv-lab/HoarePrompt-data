### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several key issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop `for p in range(1, len(list1)):` only checks consecutive elements and performs the split operation based on that. This is insufficient because the split operation can affect elements that are not immediate neighbors.
   - The loop should continue until the array is sorted or no more splits can be performed. The current implementation does not ensure that all possible splits are considered.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Splitting**:
   - The condition `if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:` checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is at least 10. However, it should check if any element is greater than 10 and can be split to potentially sort the array.
   - The current implementation only attempts to split the first element that violates the sorted order, which is not comprehensive enough.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Splitting Logic**:
   - The program only attempts to split the first element that violates the sorted order. It should attempt to split any element that is at least 10 and see if it helps in sorting the array.
   - The logic should be more robust to handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits can be performed on non-consecutive elements.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if the list is sorted. However, it is used incorrectly within the loop because the loop logic is flawed.

### Annotations and Program Behavior:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before the function call `func_1`, indicating that `lst` is a list of integers between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. The program's logic is too simplistic and does not account for all possible ways to split elements and achieve a sorted array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
