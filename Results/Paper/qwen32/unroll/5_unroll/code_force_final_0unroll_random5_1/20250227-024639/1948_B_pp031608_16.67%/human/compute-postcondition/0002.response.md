Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The function returns `True` if `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
