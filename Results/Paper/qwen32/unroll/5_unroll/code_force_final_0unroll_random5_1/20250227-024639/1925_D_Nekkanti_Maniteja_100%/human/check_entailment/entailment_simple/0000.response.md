Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions. The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
    - Initially, for each pair of friends, we have a given friendship value.
    - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
    - We need to calculate the expected sum of the friendship values of all chosen pairs over `k` excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
    - The probability of choosing any specific pair in a single excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
    - For each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
    - If a pair is chosen `x` times, its contribution to the sum of friendship values is the sum of the first `x` natural numbers plus the initial friendship value.

3. **Sum of Expected Values**:
    - For each pair of friends, the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is calculated based on the expected number of times it is chosen.
    - For non-friend pairs, the contribution is always 0.

### Code Analysis

The provided code attempts to compute the expected value but has some logical errors and assumptions. Let's break down the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # This is the modular inverse of the total number of pairs
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f  # Sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a  # This line is incorrect
        
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
    - The line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen and the contribution of their friendship values.
    - The expected value calculation should consider the sum of the first `x` natural numbers for each friend pair where `x` is the expected number of times the pair is chosen.

2. **Modular Inverse Usage**:
    - The modular inverse `c` is used correctly for calculating the probability of choosing a pair, but the overall logic for expected value calculation is flawed.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly compute the expected value:
1. Calculate the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen: \(E_i = k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
2. Calculate the expected sum of friendship values for each friend pair:
    - The contribution of a friend pair with initial friendship value `f_i` chosen `E_i` times is:
      \[
      f_i + \left(\frac{E_i(E_i + 1)}{2}\right)
      \]
3. Sum the contributions of all friend pairs and non-friend pairs (which is 0).

Given the complexity of the correct approach, the provided code does not correctly implement the expected value calculation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
