The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` statement. For the loop to execute, the value inside the `range` function must be greater than 0. This value is determined by the integer `t` read from the input, which represents the number of test cases.

Given the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\). Since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will always execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4**
