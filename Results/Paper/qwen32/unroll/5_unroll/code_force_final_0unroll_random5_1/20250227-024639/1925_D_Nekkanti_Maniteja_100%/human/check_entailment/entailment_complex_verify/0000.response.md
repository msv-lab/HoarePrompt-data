Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program, using the annotations and the original assessment to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
- **Constraints:** Multiple test cases, each with n children, m pairs of friends, and k excursions.
- **Output:** For each test case, print the expected value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Annotations:
- **State Before Function Call:** t test cases, each with n children, m pairs of friends, and k excursions.
- **State During Execution:**
  - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
  - `c` is the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
  - `s` accumulates the expected sum of friendship values.
  - `a` sums the initial friendship values of all pairs.
  - The loop over `m` pairs adds the initial friendship values to `a`.
  - The loop over `k` excursions updates `s` using a formula involving `c`, `i`, `m`, and `a`.

### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Reasoning:**
  - Incorrect calculation of the expected value.
  - Friendship values are not updated as pairs are chosen.
  - Incorrect probability usage and expected value computation.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Probability Calculation:**
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` correctly computes the probability of choosing any specific pair of children.
   
2. **Friendship Value Update:**
   - The code does not update the friendship values as pairs are chosen. Each time a pair is chosen, its friendship value should increase by 1.
   - The current logic simply adds the initial friendship values and a linear term, which is not the correct way to compute the expected value.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value should be computed by considering the probability of each pair being chosen and the updated friendship values over k excursions.
   - The current loop `for i in range(k):` does not correctly accumulate the expected value with the updated friendship values.

### Example Analysis:
Let's analyze the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3 2 3
  1 2 1
  2 3 2
  ```
- **Expected Output:** `14`
- **Explanation:**
  - There are 3 children and 2 pairs of friends with initial friendship values.
  - The pairs are (1, 2) with value 1 and (2, 3) with value 2.
  - Over 3 excursions, the expected sum of friendship values can be calculated by considering the probability of choosing each pair and the updated friendship values.
  - The provided code does not correctly handle these updates and probability calculations, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The friendship values are not updated as pairs are chosen, and the probability usage and expected value computation are incorrect.

**Final: False**
