The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a maximum bullet capacity `k`, a list of monster health values `a`, and a list of their positions `x`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using bullets, where the number of bullets required equals the monster's health and must be used within the absolute value of the monster's position. It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated under these conditions, otherwise 'NO'.
