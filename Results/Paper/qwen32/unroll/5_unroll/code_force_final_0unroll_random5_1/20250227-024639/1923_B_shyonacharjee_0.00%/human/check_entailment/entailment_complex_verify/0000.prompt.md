You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a maximum bullet capacity `k`, a list of monster health values `a`, and a list of their positions `x`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using bullets, where the number of bullets required equals the monster's health and must be used within the absolute value of the monster's position. It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated under these conditions, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can be demonstrated with a specific test case. The program sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character and then attempts to kill them in that order. However, this approach does not guarantee that the character can kill all monsters before they reach point 0.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
-3 2 3
```
In this case, the program will sort the monsters based on their distance from the character:
- Monster 1: Distance 3, Health 1
- Monster 2: Distance 2, Health 2
- Monster 3: Distance 3, Health 3

The program will then attempt to kill them in this order:
1. First, it will try to kill the monster at distance 2 with health 2 using 2 bullets. After this, the monster at position 2 will be dead, and the monsters at positions -3 and 3 will move closer.
2. Next, it will try to kill the monster at distance 3 with health 1 using 1 bullet. After this, the monster at position -3 will be dead, and the monster at position 2 will move closer.
3. Finally, it will try to kill the monster at distance 2 with health 3 using 3 bullets. However, by the time the program tries to kill this monster, it will already be at position 0, and the character will lose.

### Correct Approach:
A more effective approach would be to prioritize killing monsters that will reach the character the soonest, regardless of their distance. This can be achieved by calculating the time available for each monster to be killed and ensuring that the total bullets used do not exceed the total time available for all monsters.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly and can fail for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
