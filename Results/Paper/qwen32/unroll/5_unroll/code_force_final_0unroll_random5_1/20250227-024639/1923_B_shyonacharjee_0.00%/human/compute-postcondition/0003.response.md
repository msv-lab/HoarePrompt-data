Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `x` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the provided constraints.**
