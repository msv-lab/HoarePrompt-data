The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `start` and `end` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0 (since the loop starts from 0 by default when using `range(t)`).

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
