Output State: **The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `a`, and `count` do not retain any specific value after the loop as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified for each iteration, but these print statements do not affect the state of `start`, `end`, or `t`.**
