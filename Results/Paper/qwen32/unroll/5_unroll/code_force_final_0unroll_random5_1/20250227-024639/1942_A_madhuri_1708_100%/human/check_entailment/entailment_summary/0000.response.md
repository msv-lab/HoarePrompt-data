### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

1. **Case 1: \( k \geq 2 \)**
   - If \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n = k \):
     - The program outputs an array where all elements are equal to \( k \). This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of such an array are identical and sorted.
   - If \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \):
     - The program outputs `-1`. This is correct because if \( n \neq k \), it's impossible to have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts when \( k \geq 2 \). For \( k \geq 2 \), having exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts is only possible when \( n = k \) (all elements being the same).

2. **Case 2: \( k < 2 \)**
   - If \( k < 2 \) (specifically, \( k = 1 \)):
     - The program outputs the first \( n \) positive integers, i.e., `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is a valid solution because there is exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself is sorted).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both cases as per the problem requirements. For \( k \geq 2 \), it only outputs a valid array when \( n = k \), and for \( k < 2 \), it outputs an array with exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
