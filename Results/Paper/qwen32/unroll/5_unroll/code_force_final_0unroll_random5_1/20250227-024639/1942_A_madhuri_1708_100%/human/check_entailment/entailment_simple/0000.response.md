### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - The array values must be between 1 and \(10^9\).
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each defined by `n` and `k`.
   - For each test case:
     - If `k >= 2`:
       - If `n == k`, it outputs an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`. This means that the array is `[k, k, ..., k]` (n times). This array will have `n` cyclic shifts, all of which are sorted (since all elements are the same).
       - If `n != k`, it outputs `-1`. This is correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts if `k` is not equal to `n` when `k >= 2`.
     - If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`):
       - It outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself), which satisfies the condition.

3. **Verifying the Logic:**
   - When `k >= 2` and `n == k`, the array `[k, k, ..., k]` is correct because all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - When `k >= 2` and `n != k`, it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, so `-1` is correct.
   - When `k == 1`, the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (itself), which is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k == 1` by outputting a sorted array.
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k == n` by outputting an array of all identical elements.
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k < n` and `k >= 2` by outputting `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists an array satisfying the given conditions and outputs the correct result for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
