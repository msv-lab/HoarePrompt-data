The code snippet calculates the sum of all the integers in the nested lists contained within `nums`. The variable `total` is assigned this sum. The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of lists, each containing integers representing water amounts, and the sum of integers in each inner list is divisible by the length of that inner list.

After executing the code, `total` will hold the sum of all integers across all inner lists in `nums`. The other conditions regarding the structure and properties of `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by n. The length of `nums` (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the sum of all integers in `nums`.**
