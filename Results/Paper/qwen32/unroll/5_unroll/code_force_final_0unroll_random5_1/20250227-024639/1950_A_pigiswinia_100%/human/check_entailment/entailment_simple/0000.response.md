Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

These conditions accurately correspond to the definitions of "stair" and "peak" provided in the problem description. The program handles all possible input values within the given constraints and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
