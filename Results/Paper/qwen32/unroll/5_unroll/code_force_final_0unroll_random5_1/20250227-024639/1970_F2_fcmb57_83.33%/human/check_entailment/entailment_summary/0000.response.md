**Reasoning:**

The provided program contains a critical issue that prevents it from functioning correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to calculate a new position based on the current position and a direction. However, within the function, the variables `x` and `y` are undefined. This will cause a `NameError` when the function is called.

Here's a closer look at the problematic part of the code:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

The function `func_1` is correctly defined, but it is not the issue. The issue arises from how it is used within the loop:

```python
players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
```

This line is intended to update the position of a player based on the movement specified. However, the function `func_1` is defined correctly, and the issue lies elsewhere.

The main issue is in the following line:

```python
quidditch[1] == mo[0]
```

This line is intended to assign the player who is carrying the Quaffle, but it uses the equality operator `==` instead of the assignment operator `=`. This means that the Quaffle's carrier is never actually updated, and the program will not correctly track which player is carrying the Quaffle.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the logic for scoring goals. Specifically, it checks for the Quaffle's position in the goals but does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. Instead, it only resets the Quaffle's position if the player who scored was not on their own team, which is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

The program contains critical errors that prevent it from functioning as intended. The issues with the Quaffle's carrier and the logic for scoring goals need to be corrected for the program to be accurate.
