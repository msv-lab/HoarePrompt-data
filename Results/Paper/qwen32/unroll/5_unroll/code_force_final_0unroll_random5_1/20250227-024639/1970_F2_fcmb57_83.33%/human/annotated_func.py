#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99) and a is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99) and b is odd. The field is a 2D grid of size a x b, where each cell contains either ".." (empty cell), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). There are between 1 and 5 goals for each team, exactly one Quaffle, and at most one Bludger. There are P players for each team (1 ≤ P ≤ 10). The next input is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action is a pair of characters followed by a space and a move (U, D, L, R) or a catch/throw action (C .Q for catching the Quaffle, T for throwing the Quaffle).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x + dx, y + dy, where dx is equal to b and dy is equal to b. Since x and y are not defined, a NameError would occur.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to return a new position based on an initial position and a direction, but due to undefined variables `x` and `y`, it will raise a NameError.
