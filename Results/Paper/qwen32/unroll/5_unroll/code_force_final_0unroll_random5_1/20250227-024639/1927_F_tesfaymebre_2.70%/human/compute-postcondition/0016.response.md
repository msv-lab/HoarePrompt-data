Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of vertices in a graph and `m` represents the number of edges in the graph. The constraints are that `n` must be between 3 and `m`, and `m` must be between `n` and the minimum of `n*(n - 1)/2` and `2 * 10^5`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, though the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
