The function `func_6` constructs a graph using a given number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, sorts the edges by weight in descending order, and then uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to process these edges. It identifies the smallest edge in the last updated connected component and performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes of this smallest edge. The function prints the weight of this smallest edge and the number of nodes visited in the DFS, followed by the list of nodes visited in DFS order.
