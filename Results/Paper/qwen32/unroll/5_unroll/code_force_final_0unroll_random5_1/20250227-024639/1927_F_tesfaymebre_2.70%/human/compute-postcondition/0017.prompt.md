You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5).
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of adjacent nodes connected by edges. `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a weight `w` and the two nodes `u` and `v` that the edge connects. After `m` iterations, `graph` will have `m` edges added to it, and `edges` will contain `m` tuples representing these edges. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `graph` is a defaultdict of lists; `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on weight; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with updated connected components; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `_min_edge` is the weight of the smallest edge in the last updated component; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of that smallest edge.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the weight of the smallest edge in the last updated connected component and len(res) is the number of elements in the result of the dfs function starting from node_u)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: node_u [nodes visited in DFS order starting from node_u] (where node_u is the starting node of the DFS and the nodes are the elements of the list `res`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_6` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of vertices in a graph and `m` represents the number of edges in the graph. The constraints are that `n` must be between 3 and `m`, and `m` must be between `n` and the minimum of `n*(n - 1)/2` and `2 * 10^5`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, though the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
