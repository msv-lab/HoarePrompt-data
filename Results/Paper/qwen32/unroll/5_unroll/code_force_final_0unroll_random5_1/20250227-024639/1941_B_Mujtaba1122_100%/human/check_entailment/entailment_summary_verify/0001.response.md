### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment in detail to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) and performing the following changes:
- \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
- \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
- \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

The operation can be applied any number of times, and any index \( i \) can be used zero or more times.

#### Program Analysis

##### Function 1: `func_1`
```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
- **Purpose**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly returns `False` if any element is not zero and `True` if all elements are zero.

##### Function 2: `func_2`
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
- **Purpose**: This function attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero.
- **Issues**:
  1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect. The program should decrement `list[i + 1]` by `1`, `list[i]` by `2`, and `list[i - 1]` by `1`, not by `list[i - 1]`. The current logic incorrectly multiplies the decrements by `list[i - 1]`.
  2. **Early Termination**: The program checks if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the `while` loop and immediately prints 'no' and returns if it is not zero. This is incorrect because the operation might still be applicable to other elements, and the program should continue checking the rest of the array.
  3. **Case Sensitivity**: The problem statement allows for any case in the output ('YES' or 'NO'). The program prints 'no' in lowercase, which is not compliant with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness Evaluation

Given the issues identified in the original assessment:
1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: This is a critical issue because the operation logic directly affects whether the program can correctly determine if the array can be made zero.
2. **Early Termination**: This issue prevents the program from considering all possible operations on the array.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: While this is a minor issue, it does not affect the correctness of the logic but affects compliance with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect operation logic and early termination. These issues prevent the program from correctly determining if the array can be made zero using the specified operations.

**Final: False**
