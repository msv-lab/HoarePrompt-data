You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the number of cards and `k` is the position of the card to be found.

2. **Loop through test cases**:
   - `s` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - `m` is initialized to 1. This variable represents the multiplier for the odd numbers being considered (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, ...).

3. **Determine the multiplier**:
   - The while loop runs until `n` becomes 0.
   - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards that can be laid down at the current multiplier.
   - `n` is then halved (`n //= 2`), representing the reduction in the number of cards after laying down the odd-numbered cards.
   - The condition `if s < k and k <= s + x` checks if the `k`-th card is among the current set of cards being laid down. If it is, the loop breaks.
   - If the `k`-th card is not in the current set, `s` is incremented by `x` (the number of cards just laid down), and `m` is doubled (the next set of cards will be multiples of the next integer).

4. **Calculate the `k`-th card**:
   - Once the correct multiplier `m` is found, the `k`-th card is calculated as `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula ensures that the correct card in the sequence of multiples of the odd numbers is returned.

The program correctly handles the logic of laying down cards in the specified order and efficiently finds the `k`-th card using the described method. Given the constraints and the logic, it seems to cover all potential cases correctly, including edge cases like `n = 1` and large values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
