Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the number of ways to choose three or more identical integers from the list, and the number of ways to choose two identical integers from the list in combination with previously processed integers. The function prints the result for each test case.**
