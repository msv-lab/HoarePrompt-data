To understand the output state, let's break down the code logic.

The given code processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of integers `num_list`. For each test case, it calculates a result `res` based on the frequency of elements in `num_list`. Specifically, it counts the number of ways to choose 3 elements that are the same and the number of ways to choose 2 elements that are the same and pair them with any previously counted elements. The result `res` for each test case is then appended to the `results` list.

The loop iterates over each test case, processes it, and appends the result to the `results` list. After all test cases are processed, the `results` list contains the results for each test case.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case.
- `results` is an empty list.

After the loop executes all the iterations:
- `results` will contain the calculated results for each test case.

Since the exact test cases are not provided, we can't compute the specific values in the `results` list. However, we can describe the structure of the output state.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the calculated results for each test case.**
