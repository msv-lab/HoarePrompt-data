The code snippet `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the value of `b[i]` based on the previous value of `b[i - 1]` and the value of `x`. The value of `x` is determined by whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not. Since `a` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are integers read from the input, `x` will be `2` for `b[1]` (since `a[1]` is not defined in the initial state and would be an input value, but we know `a[0]` is `0` and hence `x` for `b[1]` would be `2` if `a[1] > 1` else `x` would be `1`). For all subsequent `b[i]`, `x` will similarly depend on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.

The initial state specifies that `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to `0`. After the execution of the code snippet, `b[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of `x` values from `b[1]` to `b[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; The array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9; For each query `i`, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `b[1]` to `b[i]`; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2.**
