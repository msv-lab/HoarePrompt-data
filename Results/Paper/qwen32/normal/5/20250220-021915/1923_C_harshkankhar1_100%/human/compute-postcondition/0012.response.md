Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; The array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9; For each query `i`, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `b[1]` to `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range 1 to 300,000.
- The variable `q` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range 1 to 300,000.
- The array `c` remains unchanged and still contains `n` integers, each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1,000,000,000.
- For each query `i`, the values `l_i` and `r_i` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`.
- The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 300,000.
- The sum of all `q` values across all test cases does not exceed 300,000.
- The array `a` remains unchanged, starting with `0` followed by integers read from the input.
- The array `b` is fully computed such that each `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `b[1]` to `b[i]`, where `x` is determined to be 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 otherwise.
