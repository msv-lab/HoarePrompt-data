t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5. The array c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9. For each query i, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
