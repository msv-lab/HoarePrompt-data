The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function determines whether the sum of elements in the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) is less than the cumulative sum of values `x` (where `x` is 1 if the element is greater than 1, otherwise 2) for the same subarray. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.
