Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `q`, an array `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function processes each query to determine a result based on the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive). The function returns the result for each query.**
