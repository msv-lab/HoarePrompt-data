The code snippet initializes a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The initial state of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `ones` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ones` is a list of n + 1 integers where each element is 0; `sum` is a list of n + 1 integers where each element is 0.**
