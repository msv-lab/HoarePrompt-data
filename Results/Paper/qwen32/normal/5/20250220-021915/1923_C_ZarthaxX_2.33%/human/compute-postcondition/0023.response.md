The initial state provides a detailed description of the variables and their relationships, but for the given print statement, we only need to focus on the final print statement and the condition that ensures it executes.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The precondition states that the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds true. This condition is evaluated before the print statement, and since it is stated to be true, the print statement will execute.

Given that the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variable values other than the condition being true, the output will simply be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
