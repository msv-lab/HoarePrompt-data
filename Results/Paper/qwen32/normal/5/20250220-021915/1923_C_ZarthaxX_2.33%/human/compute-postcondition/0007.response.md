The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the range they define. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted as it defines the upper limit of the range.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ones` is a list of n + 1 integers where `ones[1]` is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, else `ones[1]` is 0; `sum` is a list of n + 1 integers where `sum[1]` is `nums[0] - 1` and other elements are 0; `i` is 2**
