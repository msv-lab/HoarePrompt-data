The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `l` and `r`. The values of `l` and `r` are updated, but no other variables are affected. The initial state specifies the ranges and properties of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, and `sumInRange`. After the execution of the code, only `l` and `r` will have new values based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 0 <= q - 1 <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.**
