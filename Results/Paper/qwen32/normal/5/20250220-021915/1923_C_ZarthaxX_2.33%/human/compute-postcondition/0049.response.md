Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, an integer `q`, and a list of `n` integers. It then processes `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it checks if a specific condition is met on the sublist of integers from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) and prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.**
