The code snippet calculates the number of 1s in the range from index `l` to `r` in the `nums` list using the `ones` array. The value of `onesInRange` is updated to reflect this count. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. If `l` equals `r`, no further changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, the else part does not execute, and the state of the variables remains as described.**
