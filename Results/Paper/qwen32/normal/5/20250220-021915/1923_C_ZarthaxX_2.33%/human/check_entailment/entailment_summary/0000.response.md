### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

The program is designed to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` of the given array `c` is "good" according to the conditions specified in the problem.

#### Key Conditions to Check:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the subarray must be equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length where each `b[i] > 0` and `b[i] != a[i]`.
2. **Non-equality Condition**: Each element in the subarray `a` must not be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. **Positive Condition**: Each element in `b` must be greater than 0.

#### Approach Used in the Program:
- The program calculates two prefix arrays:
  - `ones`: A prefix sum array that counts the number of 1s up to each index.
  - `sum`: A prefix sum array that calculates the sum of the elements in the subarray minus 1 for each element.
- For each query, the program computes the count of 1s and the adjusted sum in the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]`.
- The program then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is satisfied, which is a mathematical reformulation of the problem's conditions.

#### Analysis:
- If the subarray contains only one element (`l == r`), it's impossible to have a different array `b` that satisfies all conditions, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.
- For longer subarrays, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` ensures that there is enough "slack" in the sum to create a different array `b` that meets all conditions. Specifically:
  - `onesInRange` counts how many 1s are in the subarray.
  - `sumInRange` is the sum of the subarray minus 1 for each element.
  - The condition checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of 1s (since 1s can't be decreased further) plus the number of elements is sufficient to accommodate a different array `b`.

The logic appears to be correct based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
