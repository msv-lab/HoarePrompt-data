Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, and `l` equals `r`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
