You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to determine the goodness of a subarray is flawed.

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: The sum of the subarray `a` should be equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. **Condition 2**: Each element `a_i` should not be equal to the corresponding element `b_i`.
3. **Condition 3**: Each element `b_i` should be greater than 0.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses two auxiliary arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to determine the goodness of a subarray. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- `ones[i]` keeps track of the number of 1s up to the i-th element.
- `sum[i]` keeps track of the sum of the subarray up to the i-th element minus the number of elements in the subarray.

The core logic for determining if a subarray is good is:
```python
if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
This logic seems to be an attempt to check if we can construct array `b` such that it satisfies all the conditions. However, there are several issues with this logic:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The `sum` array is calculated as `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`, which does not correctly represent the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements.
2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not correctly check if we can construct array `b` that satisfies all the conditions.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
5 1
2 2 2 2 2
1 5
```
The subarray is `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The sum of this subarray is `10`. To satisfy the conditions, we need to construct array `b` such that:
- `sum(b) = 10`
- `b_i != 2` for all `i`
- `b_i > 0` for all `i`

One possible array `b` could be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 6]`, which satisfies all the conditions. However, the provided program will incorrectly determine this subarray as not good.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the goodness of subarrays in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
