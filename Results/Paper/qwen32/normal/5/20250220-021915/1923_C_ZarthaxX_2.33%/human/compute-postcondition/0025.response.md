The given initial state describes a series of variables and conditions, but the final print statement is straightforward. The code snippet provided is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement is not dependent on any variables, conditions, or the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, or `sumInRange`. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
