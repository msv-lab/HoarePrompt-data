The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the innermost loop or conditional block. However, since there is no loop or conditional block shown in the provided code, the `break` statement will have no effect on the variables `num` and `counter`. Therefore, the values of `num` and `counter` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `counter` is 0, and the element `num[i]` is not equal to '0'.**
