The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and m (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), where n is the number of integers in the list and m is the parameter determining when Sasha wins. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the list of integers. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
