Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to redistribute water among containers such that each container ends up with the same amount of water. The key insight is that, starting from the left, the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean (target amount per container) should never be negative. This is because any negative cumulative difference would imply that we need to take water from a future container, which is not allowed by the problem constraints (water can only be poured from a container to a container to its right).

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:
1. It calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.
2. It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the difference between the current cumulative water amount and the expected cumulative water amount (if all containers had the mean amount).
3. If at any point this running total (cumulative difference) becomes negative, it returns 'NO', indicating that the redistribution is not possible.
4. If the loop completes without the cumulative difference going negative, it returns 'YES', indicating that the redistribution is possible.

The function also correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, although this check is redundant given the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

Therefore, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
