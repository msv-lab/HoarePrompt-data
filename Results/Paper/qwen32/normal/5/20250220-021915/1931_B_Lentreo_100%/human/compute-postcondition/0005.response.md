The code calculates the mean by performing an integer division of `total` by `n`. Since `total` is divisible by `n`, the result of this division will be an integer. The value of `mean` will be this integer result.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` is the number of test cases (equal to the length of `nums`); `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`.**
