nums is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of containers, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
