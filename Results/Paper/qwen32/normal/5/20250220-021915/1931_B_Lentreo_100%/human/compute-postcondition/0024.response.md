Functionality: **The function `func_1` evaluates a list of test cases where each test case consists of a number of containers and their respective water amounts. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in such a way that all containers in each test case end up with the same amount of water, given that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If the redistribution is possible, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
