The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (specifically, `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration), `n` is greater than 0, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous iteration. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` and `n` remains the same.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`**
