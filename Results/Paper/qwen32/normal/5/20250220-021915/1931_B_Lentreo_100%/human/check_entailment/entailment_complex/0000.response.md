Reasoning: 
The provided program is designed to determine if it's possible to redistribute water in containers such that all containers have the same amount of water. The logic of the program is based on the following key points:

1. **Total Water Divisibility**: The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. This is already ensured by the problem statement, so the check is redundant but does no harm.

2. **Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have if the water were evenly distributed.

3. **Prefix Sum Check**: The program uses a prefix sum approach to check if it's possible to redistribute the water. It iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps a running total of the difference between the current amount of water and the mean. If at any point this running total becomes negative, it means that to make the current container have the mean amount of water, we would need to take water from a previous container, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints (water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index). If the running total never goes negative, it means that we can redistribute the water as required.

The annotated program description has a minor mistake in the state description before the function call. It incorrectly states that `nums` is a list of lists, but in reality, `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts for a single test case. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to handle a single test case at a time.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly determines if it's possible to redistribute the water as required.

Correctness: **True**
