Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using a specific operation: pouring any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i < j.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Water Divisibility**: The sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, n. This means that the target amount of water in each container, if we could achieve it, would be `total_sum // n`.

2. **Operation Constraints**: The operation allows water to be transferred only from a container with a smaller index to one with a larger index. This means that once water is transferred to a container at a higher index, it cannot be transferred back to a container at a lower index.

3. **Feasibility Check**: To check if it's possible to balance the water, we need to ensure that at any point in the process of transferring water, we do not end up with a negative amount of water in any container. This can be checked by maintaining a running balance of water as we iterate through the containers.

### Program Analysis:
The given program follows a straightforward approach to check if it's possible to balance the water:
- It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`mean`).
- It then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running balance (`curr`) of water.
- If at any point the running balance (`curr`) becomes negative, it returns "NO", indicating that it's not possible to balance the water.
- If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it returns "YES".

### Correctness:
The logic of the program is correct because:
- The running balance (`curr`) ensures that we are not taking more water than is available from the containers we have processed so far.
- If the running balance is non-negative throughout the iteration, it means we can always transfer water in such a way that each container ends up with the target amount of water.

Therefore, the given program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
