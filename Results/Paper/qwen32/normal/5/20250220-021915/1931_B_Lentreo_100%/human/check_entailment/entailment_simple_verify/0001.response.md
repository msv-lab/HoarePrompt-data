Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the given program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires determining whether it's possible to equalize the amount of water in `n` containers using the specified operation: pouring water from a container with a smaller index to one with a larger index.

### Key Observations
1. **Sum Divisibility**: The total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that a target amount per container (`mean = total_sum // n`) exists.
2. **Operation Constraint**: Water can only be transferred from a container with a smaller index to one with a larger index.
3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if it's possible to achieve the target amount by maintaining a running balance of water as it iterates through the containers.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. **Calculate Target Amount**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`mean`).
2. **Running Balance Check**: It iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running balance (`curr`) of water. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns "NO", indicating that it's not possible to balance the water.
3. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns "YES".

### Annotations and Logic Validation
Let's validate the annotations and the logic of the program:
- **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes `total` as the sum of the list `nums` and calculates `mean` as `total // n`.
- **Running Balance**: The loop iterates through the list, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount (`nums[i]`) and the target amount (`mean`). If `curr` ever goes negative, the program correctly returns "NO".
- **Final Check**: If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, the program correctly returns "YES".

### Evaluation of Annotations
The annotations provided are somewhat misleading and contain errors:
- **State of `nums`**: The annotations incorrectly state that `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case. In reality, `nums` is a single list representing the water amounts for a single test case.
- **State of `total`**: The annotations incorrectly state that `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`. In reality, `total` is the sum of the integers in the single list `nums`.

### Correctness
Despite the misleading annotations, the logic of the program itself is correct:
- The program correctly calculates the target amount (`mean`).
- The running balance (`curr`) ensures that we do not take more water than is available from the containers we have processed so far.
- If `curr` is non-negative throughout the iteration, it means we can always transfer water in such a way that each container ends up with the target amount of water.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The annotations are misleading but do not affect the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
