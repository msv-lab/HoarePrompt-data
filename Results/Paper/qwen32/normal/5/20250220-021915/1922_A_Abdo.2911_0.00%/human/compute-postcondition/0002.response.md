The code snippet `n = int(input())` will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The input operation will override this value with a new integer input provided by the user.

Given that `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the input operation, they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
