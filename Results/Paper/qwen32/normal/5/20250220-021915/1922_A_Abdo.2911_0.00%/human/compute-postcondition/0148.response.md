Output State: **`match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True; `match_c` is False; `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 0; the character at `template[i]` is not lowercase; the character at `c[i]` is equal to the character at `template[i]` (case-insensitive)**

In simple terms, the value of `match_c` has been changed to `False`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.
