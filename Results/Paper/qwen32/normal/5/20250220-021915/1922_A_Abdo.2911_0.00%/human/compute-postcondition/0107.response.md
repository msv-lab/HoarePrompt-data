Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2, and `template` includes the character at index 2 of `a`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `template` has an additional element which is the character at index 2 of `a`. Otherwise, `template` includes the uppercase character at index 2 of `a`.**
