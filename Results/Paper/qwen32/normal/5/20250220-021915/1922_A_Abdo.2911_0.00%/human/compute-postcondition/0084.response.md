The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`, which are `True` and `False` respectively.
2. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`, which directly outputs the string `'YES'`.
3. Since there are no variables or expressions in the `print` statement that depend on `match_a_b` or `match_c`, their values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
