The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these variables. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition `n` being greater than 0 is already satisfied, so `n` does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, or if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value. `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0.**
