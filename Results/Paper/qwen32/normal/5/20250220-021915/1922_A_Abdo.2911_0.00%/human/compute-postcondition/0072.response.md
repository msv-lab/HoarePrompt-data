Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is `False` if the lowercase version of `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value; `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
