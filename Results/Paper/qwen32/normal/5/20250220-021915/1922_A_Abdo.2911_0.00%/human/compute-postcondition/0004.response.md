The code snippet provided is `b = input().strip()`. This line of code will take an input from the user, which is expected to be a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and then strip any leading or trailing whitespace from that input. The variable `b` will be updated to this new value.

Given the initial state, the value of `b` was a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. After executing the code, `b` will still consist of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, but any leading or trailing whitespace that the user might have entered will be removed. Since the precondition specifies that `b` originally has no leading or trailing whitespace, the value of `b` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (unchanged), `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
