Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `False` because the condition to set it to `False` was met during an iteration; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of `template` is a lowercase letter. Additionally, the character at index `i` of `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `template`.**
