Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` has an additional character. If `a[4]` is equal to `b[4]`, `template` includes the character `a[4]`. Otherwise, `template` includes the uppercase version of `a[4]`.**
