Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 2; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 2. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**
