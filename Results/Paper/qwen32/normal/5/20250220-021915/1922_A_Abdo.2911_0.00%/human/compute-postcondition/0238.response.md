The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an index within the bounds of `template`, and `n` is the length of `template` or some upper bound that is greater than `i`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next index in the `template` list. The variable `n` does not need to be changed as it represents the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

State: **`template` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `match_c` is a boolean**
