Postcondition: **`template` is a list, `i` is an index within the bounds of `template`, and `match_c` is a boolean. If the character at `template[i]` is lowercase and not equal to the character at `c[i]`, `match_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at `template[i]` is lowercase and equal to the character at `c[i]`, `match_c` retains its original value. If the element at `template[i]` is not lowercase and equal to the element at `c[i]` when both are converted to lowercase, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its original value and the loop or if statement continues.**
