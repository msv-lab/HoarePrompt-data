The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `a` by reading a string input from the user and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
