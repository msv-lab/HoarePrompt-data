Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True. `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `b` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `c` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` is 0.**
