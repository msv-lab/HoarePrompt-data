The given code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `template`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the element at the new value of `i` is appended to `template`. The precondition `n` is greater than `i + 1` remains valid unless `i` reaches `n-1` after the increment, but since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n` and `i`, we can assume that the condition still holds for this execution.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `template` now includes `a[i]`**.
