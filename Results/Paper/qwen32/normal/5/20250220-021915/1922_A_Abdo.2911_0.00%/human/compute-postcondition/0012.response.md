Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**
