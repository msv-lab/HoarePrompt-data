The code snippet `template.append(a[i].upper())` takes the character at index `i` from string `a`, converts it to uppercase, and appends it to the list `template`. 

Given that `template` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, `template` will contain one element: the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`**.
