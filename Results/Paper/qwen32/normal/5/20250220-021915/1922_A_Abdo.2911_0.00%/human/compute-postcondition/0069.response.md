The code snippet `match_c = False` directly sets the value of `match_c` to `False`, regardless of its previous value. The values of `match_a_b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is `False`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0**.
