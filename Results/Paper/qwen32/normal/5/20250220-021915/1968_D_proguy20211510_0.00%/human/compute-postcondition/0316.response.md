Postcondition: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`. `sb` is `k*maxa`. `i` is `1`. `ptsb` is `[preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1], ..., preb[k-1]]`. `maxa` is `max(a)`. `n` is the first value from the input as an integer. `k` is greater than 0. `pb` is `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer. `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `foundb` is `True`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `b` includes `maxa` as an additional element. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` as an additional element. The variables `pres`, `ss`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `s`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the conditions involving `founds`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, `b` includes `(k - 2) * maxa` and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], (k - 2) * maxa]`. Otherwise, `b` and `s` remain unchanged as described above.**
