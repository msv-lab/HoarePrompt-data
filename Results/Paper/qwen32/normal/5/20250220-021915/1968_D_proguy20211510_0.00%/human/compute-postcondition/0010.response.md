The provided initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('Draw')`. This statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'Draw' regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and their states**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers.
   - `pb` and `ps` are indices related to the list `a`.
   - `p` is a list of integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - The value at index `pb - 1` in `a` is equal to the value at index `ps - 1` in `a` and both are equal to `maxa`.

2. **The print statement**:
   - The `print('Draw')` statement outputs the string 'Draw'.

Since the print statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, or `maxa`, the output is simply the string 'Draw'.

Output: **Draw**
