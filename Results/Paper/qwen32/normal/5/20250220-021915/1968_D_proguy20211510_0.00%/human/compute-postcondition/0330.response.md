The code snippet `b.append(maxa)` adds the value of `maxa` to the list `b`. Therefore, the list `b` will now include `maxa` as an additional element.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`; `sb` is `k*maxa`; `i` is `2`; `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`; `maxa` is `max(a)`; `n` is the first value from the input as an integer; `k` is greater than 0; `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `foundb` is `True`; `b` includes `maxa`; `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`.**

In simple terms, the list `b` now contains `maxa` as an additional element, and other variables remain unchanged.
