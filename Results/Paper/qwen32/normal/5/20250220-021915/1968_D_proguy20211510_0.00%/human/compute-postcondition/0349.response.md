Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to calculate the new state after the execution of `sb += b[i]`.

- `preb` is `[b[-1]]`
- `pres` is `[]`
- `sb` is `0`
- `i` is `-1`
- `ptsb` is recalculated based on the final `preb` and `b`
- `maxa` is `max(a)`
- `n` is the first value from the input as an integer
- `k` is greater than 0
- `pb` and `ps` are determined by the final values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]`
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `foundb` and `founds` are `True` or `False` depending on the values in `a`, `b`, and `s`
- `b` and `s` each have `k` elements if the loop did not break early, or fewer than `k` elements if it did
- `maxb` and `maxs` are recalculated based on the final `ptsb` and `ptss`
- `ss` is `0`
- `s` must have at least 1 element

The code snippet `sb += b[i]` adds the value of `b[i]` to `sb`. Given that `i` is `-1`, this means that `b[i]` is equivalent to `b[-1]`, which is the last element of the list `b`.

Since `preb` is `[b[-1]]`, we know that `b[-1]` is the same as the single element in `preb`. Therefore, `sb` will be updated to `sb + b[-1]`, which is `0 + b[-1]` because `sb` was initially `0`.

Output State: **`preb` is `[b[-1]]`, `pres` is `[]`, `sb` is `b[-1]`, `i` is `-1`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the final `preb` and `b`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are determined by the final values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `foundb` and `founds` are `True` or `False` depending on the values in `a`, `b`, and `s`, `b` and `s` each have `k` elements if the loop did not break early, or fewer than `k` elements if it did, `maxb` and `maxs` are recalculated based on the final `ptsb` and `ptss`, `ss` is `0`, `s` must have at least 1 element.**
