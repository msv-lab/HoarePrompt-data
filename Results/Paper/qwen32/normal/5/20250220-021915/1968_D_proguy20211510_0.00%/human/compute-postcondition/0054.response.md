The code snippet appends a new value to the list `b`. The new value is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the new value becomes `(k - 2) * maxa`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the execution of the code snippet:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 1; `b` is a list with an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`.**

In natural language: The output state is that the variable `b` now includes an additional element calculated as `(k - 2) * maxa`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
