Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to `maxa`, then the condition `a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa` holds. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` can either be equal to `maxa` or not equal to `maxa`.**
