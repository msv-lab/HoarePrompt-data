The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `0` and `rem` is `k - 1`. Therefore, the new element added to `ptss` is `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`.

The other variables (`preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `rem`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `0`, `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]]`, `rem` is `k - 1`**.
