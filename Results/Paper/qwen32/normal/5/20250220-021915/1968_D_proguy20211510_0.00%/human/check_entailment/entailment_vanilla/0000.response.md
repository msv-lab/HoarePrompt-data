Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if the values at Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions are both the maximum in the array `a`.
     - If so, it prints "Draw".
     - If only Bodya's position has the maximum value, it prints "Bodya".
     - If only Sasha's position has the maximum value, it prints "Sasha".
   - This is a correct strategy because if the maximum value is at both positions, the game will end in a draw regardless of the moves.
   - If the maximum value is at one player's position, that player can always win by staying in that position.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha respectively for each turn.
   - It also initializes two boolean variables `foundb` and `founds` to track if Bodya or Sasha has reached the maximum value.
   - For each turn up to `k`, the program:
     - Checks if either player has already found the maximum value. If both have, it appends the remaining turns multiplied by the maximum value to both `b` and `s` and breaks the loop.
     - If Bodya has not found the maximum value, it checks if the current position of Bodya has the maximum value. If so, it sets `foundb` to `True` and appends the maximum value to `b`. Otherwise, it appends the value at Bodya's current position to `b` and updates Bodya's position to `p[pb - 1]`.
     - It performs the same checks and updates for Sasha.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating through the `b` and `s` lists.
   - It then calculates the potential scores for Bodya and Sasha if they stay at their current positions for the remaining turns.
   - It finds the maximum potential score for both players.

5. **Determine Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's maximum potential score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's is higher, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the initial checks and simulates the game to determine the winner based on the maximum potential scores. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
