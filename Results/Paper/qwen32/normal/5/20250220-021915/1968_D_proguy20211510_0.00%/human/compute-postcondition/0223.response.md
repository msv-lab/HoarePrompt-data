The code `sb += b[i]` increments the variable `sb` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `preb` has already had `sb + b[i]` appended to it in the initial state, the value of `sb` will now be updated.

Output State: **`s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `preb` has a new element appended, which is the result of `sb + b[i]`; `sb` is now `sb + b[i]`.**

In natural language: The list `s` remains unchanged. The list `preb` still has a new element appended, which is the result of `sb + b[i]`. The variable `sb` has been updated to be `sb + b[i]`.
