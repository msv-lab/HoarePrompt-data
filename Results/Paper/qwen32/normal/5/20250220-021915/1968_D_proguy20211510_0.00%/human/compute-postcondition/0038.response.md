The code snippet appends the element at index `pb - 1` from list `a` to list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, the output state will reflect this change in list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `b` is a list containing one element `a[pb - 1]`; `s` is a list, where if `founds` is True, `s` contains one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values, and if both are True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `i` is 0; `foundb` is False; `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
