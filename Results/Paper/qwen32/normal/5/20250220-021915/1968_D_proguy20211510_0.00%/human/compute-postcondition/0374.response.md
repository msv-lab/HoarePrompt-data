Output State: **`preb` is the cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least `len(s) + 1` elements, `sb` is `sum(b)`, `ss` is `sum(s)`, `i` is `len(s) + 2`, `ptsb` is `ptsb` with an additional element `preb[len(s) + 1] + (k - (len(s) + 2)) * b[len(s) + 1]` and another additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is `ptss` with an additional element `pres[len(s)] + rem * s[len(s)]` and another additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `ptsb` is updated by appending another element, which is `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Other variables remain unchanged.
