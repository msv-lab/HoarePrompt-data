The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Given the initial state, `s` either contains `[(k - 1) * maxa]` if `founds` is `True`, or `s` is not modified if `founds` is `False`. After the code is executed, `s` will definitely contain the new element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 0. `founds` is False. If `foundb` is True, then `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`. If `foundb` is False, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `b` is a list containing one element `a[pb - 1]`. `s` contains `[(k - 1) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]` if `founds` is True, otherwise `s` contains `[a[ps - 1]]`. Additionally, `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
