The given Python code snippet modifies the value of `sb` by adding the element at index `i` of list `b` to it. Given that `i` is 3, `sb` is incremented by `b[3]`. The value of `preb` is not affected by this operation, and it still contains an additional element which is the value of `sb + b[3]` at the time `preb` was updated.

Output State: **`s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `i` is 3; `sb` is now equal to its previous value plus `b[3]`; `preb` now contains an additional element which is the value of `sb + b[3]` at the time `preb` was updated.**
