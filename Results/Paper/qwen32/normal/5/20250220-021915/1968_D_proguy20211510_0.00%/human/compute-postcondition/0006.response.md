The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns them to a list `p`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new list `p` along with the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
