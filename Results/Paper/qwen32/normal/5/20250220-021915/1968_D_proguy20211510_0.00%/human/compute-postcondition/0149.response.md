The code snippet provided initializes two empty lists, `b` and `s`. This action clears the contents of the existing lists `b` and `s`. However, the initial state provided includes several other variables and their relationships that are not directly affected by the reinitialization of `b` and `s`.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged:
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- `pb` is an integer.
- `ps` is an integer.
- `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`.
- `pres` is `[s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]]`.
- `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`.
- `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1]]`.
- `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], ..., pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- The condition regarding `maxs` and `maxb` remains the same.
- `p` is a list of integers from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.
- The condition regarding `a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` remains the same.

The only change is that `b` and `s` are now empty lists.
