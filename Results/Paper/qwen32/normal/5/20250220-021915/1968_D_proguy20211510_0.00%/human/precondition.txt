t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), k (an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9), P_B (an integer such that 1 <= P_B <= n), and P_S (an integer such that 1 <= P_S <= n). Following each tuple, there are two lists: p (a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and n, inclusive) and a (a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
