The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element at index `ps - 1` in the list `a` to the list `s`.

Given the initial state, the list `s` will have an additional element, which is `a[ps - 1]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 2; `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
