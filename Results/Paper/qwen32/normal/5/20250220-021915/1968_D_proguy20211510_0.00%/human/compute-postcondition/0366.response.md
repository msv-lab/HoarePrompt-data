The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. This new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is the cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is `sum(b)`, `ss` is `sum(s)`, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `ptsb` is `ptsb` with an additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is `[]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**.

In simple terms, the list `ptsb` now includes a new value calculated from `preb[i]` and `rem * b[i]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
