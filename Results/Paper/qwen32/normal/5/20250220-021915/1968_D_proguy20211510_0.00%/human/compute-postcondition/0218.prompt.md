Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]]`, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], ..., pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is [], `s` is [], `founds` is False, `foundb` is False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]]`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it remains `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1] + b[n]`. `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is updated to `[(sb + maxa + (k - n - 1) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1], (sb + b[n]) + (k - n - 1) * b[n]]` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it remains `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1], (sb + b[n]) + (k - n - 1) * b[n]]`. `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], ..., pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is True, and `founds` is a boolean that can be either True or False. If `founds` is True, `b` is `[(k - n) * maxa]` and `s` is `[(k - n) * maxa, maxa]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `b` and `s` remain unchanged except `s` now includes `a[ps - 1]` as its last element if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` and `ptsb` is adjusted accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is recalculated and includes `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1] + a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it remains `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1] + b[n]`, `ss` is recalculated and includes `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `i` is `n`, `ptsb` is adjusted based on whether `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `ptss` is recalculated and includes `pres[n] + (k - n - 1) * s[n]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is True, and `founds` is either True or False. If `founds` is True, `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], maxa]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` includes `a[ps - 1]` as its last element and `founds` is True. If `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `founds` remains unchanged. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is recalculated and includes `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1] + a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1] + b[n]`, `ss` is recalculated and includes `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `i` is `n + 1`, `ptsb` is adjusted based on whether `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `ptss` is recalculated and includes `pres[n] + (k - n - 1) * s[n]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is True, and `founds` is either True or False. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is True, `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], maxa]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], a[ps - 1]]`. If `founds` is False, `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], a[ps - 1]]` and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is True and `founds` is False, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
