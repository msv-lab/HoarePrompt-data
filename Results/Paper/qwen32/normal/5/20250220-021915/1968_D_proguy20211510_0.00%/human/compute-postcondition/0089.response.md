Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 2; `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, after the if-else block executes, `s` will always include an additional element `a[ps - 1]`, regardless of whether `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` or not. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.
