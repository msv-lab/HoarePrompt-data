Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is [], `pres` is [], `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is adjusted based on the elements in `b`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the elements in `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is `[maxa, maxa, ..., maxa]` (k times), `s` is `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], ..., a[ps - 1]]` or `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], ..., maxa]` if `founds` becomes `True`, `foundb` is `True`, and `founds` is a boolean that can be either `True` or `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `preb` has a new element appended, which is the result of `sb + b[i]`; `sb` is now `sb + b[i]`; `pres` has a new element appended, which is `ss + s[i]`; `ss` is now `ss + s[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `preb` has a new element which is the sum of `sb` and `b[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `sb` is updated to `sb + b[i]`; `pres` has a new element which is the sum of `ss` and `s[i]`; `ss` is updated to `ss + s[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `i` is 3; `sb` is now equal to its previous value plus `b[3]`; `preb` now contains an additional element which is the value of `sb + b[3]` at the time `preb` was updated; `pres` now contains an additional element which is the value of `ss + s[3]` before the increment; `ss` is now equal to its previous value plus `s[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
