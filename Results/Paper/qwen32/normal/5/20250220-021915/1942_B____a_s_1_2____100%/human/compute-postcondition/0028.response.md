The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the `for` loop statement, `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration is `i` is `0`, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it would take in the loop, which is `-1` for the loop to terminate.

However, since the task is to determine the state at the start of the next iteration for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the value of `i` just before the loop would terminate. Therefore, we need to set `i` to `1` (since the previous value was `0` and `i` decrements by `1` in each iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the 0-th element is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]` and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]`; `i` is 1**
