The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` relative to `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `_` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**

Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `previous_value_of_ + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is `previous_value_of_ + 1`.**

To make it more concrete, if `_` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be 3. So the state would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is 3.**

However, since we do not know the exact value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is `previous_value_of_ + 1`.**

But typically, we would just say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
