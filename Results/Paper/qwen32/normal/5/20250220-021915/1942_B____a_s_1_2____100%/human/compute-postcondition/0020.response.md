Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of -1's with length `n`; `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is reassigned to be a list of -1's with a length equal to `n`. All other variables retain their previous values.
