To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior step by step.

The loop iterates from `i = n - 1` down to `i = 0`. During each iteration, it updates the list `p` and the variable `mex` as follows:
- `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
- `mex` is then updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

The loop's behavior can be summarized as:
1. Start with `mex = n`.
2. For each `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
   - Compute `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

This means that `mex` will keep track of the smallest value encountered in the list `p` during the loop. The list `p` will be filled with values `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` will be updated to ensure it remains the smallest value in `p`.

After the loop completes, `p` will be fully populated, and `mex` will be the smallest value in `p`.

The final output state can be described as:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `p` is a list where `p[i] = mex_initial - a[i]` for each `i`, and `mex_initial` is the initial value of `mex` (which is `n`).
- `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.

In natural language, this means that each element of the list `p` is calculated as the initial value of `mex` (which is `n`) minus the corresponding element in the list `a`. The variable `mex` is then updated to be the smallest value in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where `p[i] = n - a[i]` for each `i`, and `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.**
