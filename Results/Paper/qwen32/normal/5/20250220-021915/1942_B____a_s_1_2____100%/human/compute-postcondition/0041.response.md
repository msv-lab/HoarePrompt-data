To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and implicitly the list `a` and `p` as they are used in the loop body, but their values do not change in the loop head itself. The loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`
- `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`

The loop is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` took a value and the loop decrements `i` in each iteration. Therefore, to find the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it will take.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current `i` value**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `i = k`.
2. **Loop decrement**: The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
3. **Next `i` value**: Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

Since the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` decremented by 1.

### Adjusting the State:
- `i` will be decremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` and `p` remain the same as their values do not change in the loop head.
- `mex` is dependent on the current value of `i` and `a[i]`, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, `mex` does not need to be recalculated here.

### Final State:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

Assuming the end of the previous iteration had `i` as some value `k`, the start of the next iteration will have `i` as `k - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `k - 1`**.

Since we do not know the exact value of `k` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we express the state in terms of `k - 1`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `i - 1`**. 

However, for clarity and to follow the format strictly:

If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `k - 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `k`, we can express the state generally as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is decremented by 1**.

To be precise in the format given:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `i - 1`**.

For the general case where `i` was `k`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `k - 1`**.

Since we do not have `k`, the most accurate general state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is decremented by 1**.

For the specific format:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `i - 1`**.

Given the loop runs from `n-1` to `0`, if `i` was `n-1` at the end of the first iteration, the next state will have `i` as `n-2`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `n - 2`**.

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `n - 2`**.
