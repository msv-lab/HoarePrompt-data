The provided code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. This means the previous list `a` is overwritten with the new input values. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `mex`, and the loop variable `_`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where `p[i] = n - a[i]` for each `i`; `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
