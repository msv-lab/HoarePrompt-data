You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and outputs a list `p` of `n` integers based on the input list `a`. The list `p` is constructed such that for each element `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is initially `n` and is updated to the minimum value in `p` after each assignment. The function outputs `t` lines, each representing the list `p` for the corresponding input values of `n` and `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The key issue lies in the calculation and updating of the `mex` value. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the `mex` value can be determined by taking the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This is not correct because the `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p` up to that point.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the problem:

**Example Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For `i = 0`, `a[0] = 1`, so `p[0] = MEX([]) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (incorrect, `p[0]` should be `0`).
- For `i = 1`, `a[1] = 1`, so `p[1] = MEX([0]) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0` (incorrect, `p[1]` should be `1`).
- For `i = 2`, `a[2] = -2`, so `p[2] = MEX([0, 1]) - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4` (correct).
- For `i = 3`, `a[3] = 1`, so `p[3] = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1` (incorrect, `p[3]` should be `2`).
- For `i = 4`, `a[4] = 2`, so `p[4] = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1` (incorrect, `p[4]` should be `3`).

The correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used numbers to determine the correct `mex` at each step. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
            mex = 0  # Reset mex to find the next smallest unused number
        print(*p)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `mex` is calculated correctly by maintaining a set of used numbers and resetting the `mex` to find the smallest unused number at each step.
