The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` modifies the `i`-th element of the list `p` by setting it to the value of `mex - a[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`) remain unchanged.

The initial state specifies that `p` is a list of -1's with length `n`. After the execution of the code snippet, the `i`-th element of `p` will be updated to `mex - a[i]`, while the other elements of `p` will still be -1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `n`**.
