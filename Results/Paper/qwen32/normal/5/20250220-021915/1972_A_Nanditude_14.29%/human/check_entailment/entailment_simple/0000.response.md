Reasoning:  
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to insert elements from `b` into `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`, but it does so incorrectly by removing the last element of `a` and then inserting `b[j]` at the wrong position. This approach does not guarantee that the array `a` will be sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion, and the removal of the last element is not based on the correct criteria (it should always remove the largest element).

The correct approach should involve inserting new elements into `a` such that the array remains sorted and the largest element is removed after each insertion, until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

The function `func_1` provided is not used in the main logic and does not contribute to solving the problem. It simply sorts the input array in reverse order, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
