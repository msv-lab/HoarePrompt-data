Output State: **The program returns the list `arr` sorted in reverse order. Each sublist (test case) in `arr` is considered as a single element during the sorting process, and the sorting is done based on the default lexicographical order of the sublists.**

In simpler terms, the program sorts the list of test cases in `arr` from the largest to the smallest, where each test case is compared as a whole.
