Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 1\), `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and if `k` was greater than 0, then `k` is now `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and `nums[i]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. If `k` was not greater than 0, `k` remains unchanged.**
