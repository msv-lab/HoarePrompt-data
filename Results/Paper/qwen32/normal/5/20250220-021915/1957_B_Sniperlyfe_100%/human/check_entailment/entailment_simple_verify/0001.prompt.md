You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is 0 if it was exhausted during the loop, otherwise it is the remaining value, and `nums` is a list where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\) and the subsequent elements are filled with the values `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\), the subsequent elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0, making the total length of `nums` equal to `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` such that the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR (`|`) of all these integers is maximized.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program follows this outline:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. It calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
4. It prints the results for all test cases.

Let's focus on the `func_1(n, k)` function:
- It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to `0`.
- It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number less than `2^m` where `m` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`. This effectively sets `nums[0]` to the largest power of 2 just below `k`.
- It subtracts `nums[0]` from `k`.
- It then iterates over the remaining elements of `nums` and assigns the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k` to each element until `k` is fully used up.
- Finally, it adds any remaining `k` to `nums[0]`.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Let's consider the key points:
- The program attempts to maximize the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. However, the approach taken by the program does not necessarily maximize this.
- The program sets `nums[0]` to a large value and then tries to distribute the remaining `k` among the other elements. However, this does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of `1`s.
- For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The program might output `1 2`, which is correct, but it might also output `3 0`, which is also correct but does not necessarily maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR (which is `11` in both cases, but the program's strategy is not guaranteed to always produce the optimal result).

### Conclusion:

While the program may produce correct sequences for some test cases, it does not guarantee that the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct based on the problem's requirements.
