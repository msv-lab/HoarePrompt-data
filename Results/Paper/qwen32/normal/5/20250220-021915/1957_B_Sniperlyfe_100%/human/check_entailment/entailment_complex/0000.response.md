### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze the algorithm step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then sets the first element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but with all bits set to 1 except the highest bit, which is not set. This helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

2. **Adjusting the First Element**:
   - The value of `k` is reduced by the value of the first element of `nums`.
   - If `k` becomes 0, the remaining elements of `nums` remain 0.

3. **Filling the Remaining Elements**:
   - The function then iterates over the remaining elements of `nums` (from index 1 to `n-1`).
   - For each element, it sets the value to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, which ensures that the value does not exceed `k` and tries to keep the value as close to `nums[0] + 1` as possible to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.
   - The value of `k` is reduced by the assigned value.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, the function adjusts the first element of `nums` by adding the remaining `k` to it. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k`.

### Evaluation:

- The algorithm ensures that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k`.
- The strategy of maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is achieved by setting the first element to a value with the maximum number of 1s possible and then distributing the remaining `k` in a way that keeps the values close to the first element.
- The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Correctness: **True**
