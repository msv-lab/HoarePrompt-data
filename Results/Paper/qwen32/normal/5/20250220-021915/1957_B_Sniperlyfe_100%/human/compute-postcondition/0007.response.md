Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 1\), `k` is now `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers. If `k > 0`, then the first element of `nums` is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\), the `i`-th element is `1 << k.bit_length() - 1`, and the rest are zeros. If `k` is not greater than 0, the first element of `nums` remains \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\) and the rest are zeros.**
