You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is 0 if it was exhausted during the loop, otherwise it is the remaining value, and `nums` is a list where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\) and the subsequent elements are filled with the values `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\), the subsequent elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0, making the total length of `nums` equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of `nums` is calculated as \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\). The subsequent elements are the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is reduced to 0. The rest of the elements in the list are filled with 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description
Given integers n and k, construct a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that:
1. \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = k\)
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of \(a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n\) is maximized, where \(|\) denotes the bitwise OR operation.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Setting the first element of the sequence to the largest number with the same number of bits as k.
2. Distributing the remaining sum k among the remaining elements.
3. Ensuring that the sum of the sequence equals k.
4. Maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Code Review
Let's look at the function `func_1(n, k)` which is the core of the program:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
```

### Potential Issues
1. **First Element Calculation**:
   - `nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` sets the first element to the largest number with the same number of bits as k. This is not necessarily the best choice to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR result. For example, if k is a power of 2, this will set `nums[0]` to the largest number with one less bit than k, which is not optimal.

2. **Distribution of Remaining Sum**:
   - The remaining sum k is distributed among the remaining elements, but the strategy does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized. For example, if k is a power of 2, setting `nums[0]` to the largest number with one less bit than k and then distributing the remaining sum might not yield the optimal solution.

### Counterexample
Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 2, k = 4`
- Expected Output: `3 1` (since 3 | 1 = 3 in binary is 11, which has 2 ones)
- Actual Output: `3 1` (the program might produce this, but let's consider a different case)

- Input: `n = 2, k = 5`
- Expected Output: `3 2` (since 3 | 2 = 3 in binary is 11, which has 2 ones)
- Actual Output: `3 1` (the program will produce this, which is suboptimal)

### Conclusion
The program does not always produce the optimal solution for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The program does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized for all inputs. The strategy of setting the first element to the largest number with the same number of bits as k and then distributing the remaining sum does not always yield the optimal solution.
