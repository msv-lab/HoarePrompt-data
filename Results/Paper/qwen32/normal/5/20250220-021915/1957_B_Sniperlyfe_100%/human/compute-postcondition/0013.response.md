The code snippet updates the value of `nums[i]` to be the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected, and `i` has already been incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, the updated state will reflect the new value of `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 1\), `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**.
