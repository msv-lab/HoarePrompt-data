### Reasoning:
The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of the square.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: For each test case, it creates a list `x` containing the x-coordinates of the four corners.

3. **Side Length Calculation**: It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`). This works because the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, so the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) gives the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

### Analysis of the Program:
The logic of the program is correct based on the problem description. The side length of the square can be determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates). The area is then correctly calculated as the square of the side length.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
   - x-coordinates: [1, 4, 1, 4]
   - `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 4 - 1 = 3`
   - Area = `dx * dx = 3 * 3 = 9` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
   - x-coordinates: [-1, 1, 1, -1]
   - `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2`
   - Area = `dx * dx = 2 * 2 = 4` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
   - x-coordinates: [45, 45, 17, 17]
   - `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 45 - 17 = 28`
   - Area = `dx * dx = 28 * 28 = 784` (Correct)

The program correctly calculates the area for all test cases in the example.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
