The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a placeholder variable that does not retain its value between iterations, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, as each iteration of the loop corresponds to one decrement of `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is the integer input, where 0 < `t` <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.**
