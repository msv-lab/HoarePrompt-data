The given code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new 2D list constructed from the input. This means the previous contents of `a` are overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `dx`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by subsequent code, which is not provided in this snippet.

Here's the breakdown:
- `a` is reassigned to a new 2D list of 4 sublists, each containing integers from a line of input.
- `t`, `x`, and `dx` retain their initial values because they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input, where 0 < `t` <= 100; `a` is a new 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in the original `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the original list `x`.**
