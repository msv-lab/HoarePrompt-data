testcases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains four tuples, and each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates (x_i, y_i) satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. It is guaranteed that the given coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
