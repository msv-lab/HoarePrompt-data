Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is attempting to decode the string, but it is doing so incorrectly. The program is actually performing the encoding process again instead of decoding. The `func_1` function creates a mapping where each character in the encoded string is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters list, which is the same operation described as encoding in the problem statement.

To correctly decode the string, the mapping should be reversed. That is, each character in the encoded string should be mapped to its original character in the sorted unique characters list based on the symmetric position. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

With this change, the program should correctly decode the input strings.
