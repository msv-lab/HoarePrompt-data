### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The problem involves decoding a string `b` that was encoded by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart from a sorted string `r` of unique characters from the original string `s`.
   - The string `r` is formed by taking all distinct characters from `s`, sorting them, and then each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`:
     - It extracts the unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
     - It creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character.
     - It decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the process: it accepts an encoded string `b`, extracts unique characters, sorts them, creates a symmetric mapping, and decodes the string using this mapping.

4. **Validation Against Example:**
   - Let's validate the program with the provided example:
     - Input: `serofedsoc`
     - Unique characters: `cdefors`
     - Symmetric mapping: `c -> s, d -> r, e -> o, f -> f, o -> e, r -> d, s -> c`
     - Decoded string: `codeforces`
   - The program correctly decodes `serofedsoc` to `codeforces`.

5. **General Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It accurately identifies the unique characters and sorts them.
   - It creates the correct symmetric mapping and uses it to decode the string.
   - The implementation is consistent with the problem statement and the function summary.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases and processes each encoded string `b` to produce the correct original string `s`.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
