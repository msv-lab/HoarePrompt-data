The code snippet updates the `char_map` dictionary by setting the value of `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`. This means that the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` is being mapped to the character at the mirrored index from the end of `unique_chars`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `char_map` because the value at a specific key is being updated. The other variables (`encoded`, `unique_chars`, `len_unique`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.
