To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `len_unique`. The loop will execute if `len_unique` is at least 1, since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `len_unique - 1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`i`**: This variable is the loop counter and is automatically initialized to 0 before the loop starts. We do not need to adjust its initial state manually.

2. **`len_unique`**: This variable represents the length of the `unique_chars` list. For the loop to execute, `len_unique` must be greater than 0.

Given the above points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `len_unique` is greater than 0. The other variables (`encoded`, `unique_chars`, `char_map`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0**.
