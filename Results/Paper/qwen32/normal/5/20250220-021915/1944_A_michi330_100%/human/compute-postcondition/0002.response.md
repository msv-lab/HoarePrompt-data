The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` and the loop variable `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is initialized by the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
