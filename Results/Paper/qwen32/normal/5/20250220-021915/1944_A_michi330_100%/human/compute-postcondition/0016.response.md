To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
2. `i` is an integer that is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
3. `n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the new input, respectively.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n)
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we know that `n` is the first integer from the new input for each test case. The value of `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know that it will be provided as input for each test case.

### Output:
Since `n` is the first integer from the new input for each test case, the print statement will output the value of `n` for the current test case.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the new input for the current test case)**
