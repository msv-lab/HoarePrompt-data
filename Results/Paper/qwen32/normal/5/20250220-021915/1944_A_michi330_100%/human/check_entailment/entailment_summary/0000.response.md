### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater optimally destroys up to `k` bridges in a network of `n` islands initially fully connected by bridges.

The key insight is:
- If Dominater can destroy `k` bridges and `k` is at least `n-1`, Everule will be isolated on island 1 because we can always disconnect island 1 from all other islands by destroying `n-1` bridges (one bridge to each of the other `n-1` islands). Hence, the result should be `1`.
- If `k` is less than `n-1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. Therefore, Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

The provided program correctly captures this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
- It then checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If true, it prints `1` because island 1 will be isolated.
- Otherwise, it prints `n` because Everule can still visit all islands.

### Correctness:
The program's logic matches the problem's requirements, and the execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
