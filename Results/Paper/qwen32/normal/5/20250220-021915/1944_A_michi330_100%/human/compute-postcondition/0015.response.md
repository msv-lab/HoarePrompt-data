Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is an integer that is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the new input, respectively.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `k`. The values of these variables do not influence the output of this particular `print` statement because the statement explicitly prints the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(1)` statement is always `1`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1**
