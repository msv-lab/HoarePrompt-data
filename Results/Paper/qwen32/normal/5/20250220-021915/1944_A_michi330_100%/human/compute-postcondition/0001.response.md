For the given task, the for loop iterates over the range from 0 to `t` (exclusive) with a step of 1. This means the loop will execute `t` times, assuming `t` is a positive integer. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is at least 1. Since the problem statement already guarantees that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, no further adjustment is necessary for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is initialized by the loop**
