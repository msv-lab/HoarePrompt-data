The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `t` is the total number of test cases and `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is initialized by the loop and is now `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` satisfies `k >= n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` satisfies `k < n - 1`.**
