The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the `last_row`. Given the initial state, `last_row` is already the last character of the string in `a`, so appending the last character of the last string in `a` to `last_row` will essentially make `last_row` the last character of the last string in `a` repeated twice.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing two string elements (the original user input and the new user input); `first_row` is the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the second string in `a` repeated twice; `i` is incremented by 1.**
