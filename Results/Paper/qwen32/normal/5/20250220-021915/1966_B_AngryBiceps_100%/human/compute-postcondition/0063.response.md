The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n`. However, since `i` is now equal to `n`, the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be satisfied, and the loop will terminate.

Since the loop will not execute again with the current state, we do not need to adjust `n`. The state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the start of a new loop if `i` were less than `n`) would have `i` incremented by 1, but since that would make the loop condition false, we represent the state as it is right before the loop terminates.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is `n`**
