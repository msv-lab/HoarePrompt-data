The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, or `last_row`. The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
2. The variable `n` is the first integer from the input.
3. The variable `m` is the second integer from the input.
4. The variable `a` is a list of `n` string elements, all of which are user inputs.
5. The variable `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in `a`.
6. The variable `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`.
7. There are specific conditions about the first and last strings in `a` and the `first_row` and `last_row` strings, but these conditions do not affect the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables or conditions.

Output: **NO**
