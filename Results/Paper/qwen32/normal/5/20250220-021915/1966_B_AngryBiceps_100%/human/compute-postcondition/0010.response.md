The code snippet appends a new string to the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` now contains two string elements: the original string and the new string provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing two string elements (the original user input and the new user input); `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` (unchanged); `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` (unchanged); `i` is incremented by 1.**
