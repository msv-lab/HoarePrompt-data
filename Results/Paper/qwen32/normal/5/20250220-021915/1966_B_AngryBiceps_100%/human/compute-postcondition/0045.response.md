Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`. The first string in `a` consists of identical characters, the last string in `a` also consists of identical characters, and these two strings are not equal to each other.**
