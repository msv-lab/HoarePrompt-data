### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading the Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (N and M).
   - It then reads the field's configuration, identifying players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
   - It stores the positions of players in a dictionary `players` and the positions of goals in a dictionary `goals`.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves `moves`.
   - For each move, it checks the type of action (U, D, L, R, C, or T).
   - If the action is a movement (U, D, L, R), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
   - If the action is 'T' (throw), it checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team. If so, it increments the score for that team and prints the event.

3. **Handling Goal Scoring:**
   - The program correctly checks if a player is at a goal of the opposite team when they throw the Quaffle.
   - It increments the score for the correct team and prints the event.
   - However, there is a logical error in the scoring logic. The program only checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team but does not handle the case where the player scores in their own goal.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the events of scoring as required.
   - At the end, it prints the final score.

### Logical Error:
The most critical issue is that the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem statement, if a player scores in their own goal, the other team wins the point. The current implementation does not account for this scenario.

### Correctness:
Given the logical error described, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
