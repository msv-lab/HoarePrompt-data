Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0; `n` is 2 if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `n` is 1, and if `i == 0 and a[i] > 10`, `n` is 3 or 4; `c` is a list that contains `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, or just the first element of `a` if `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or if `y` > `x`, and if `i == 0 and a[i] > 10`, `c` includes `x` appended to it; if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 0; if `i == 0 and a[i] > 10`, `c` includes `a[i]` as an additional element.**
