You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.

    #State: `c` is unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` has an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element `0` appended to it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It processes the list `a` by potentially splitting two-digit numbers into their tens and units digits under certain conditions, sorts the resulting list, and checks if the original processed list is already sorted. It appends `1` to a list `b` if the processed list is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The program attempts to determine if the given array can be sorted in non-descending order by performing the specified operation any number of times. However, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not correctly implement the required operations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Splitting Logic**: The function attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their digits and insert them in the same position. However, the current logic does not correctly handle the insertion of digits into the list `c`. Instead of inserting the digits at the correct position, it simply appends them to the end of the list. This results in incorrect transformations of the array.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The function checks if the transformed list `c` is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of `c` (`d`). However, since the transformation logic is incorrect, this comparison does not accurately reflect whether the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

3. **Index Handling**: The function uses an index `n` to keep track of the position in the list `c`. However, this index is not correctly updated when digits are inserted, leading to incorrect logic for comparing digits with the previous element.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the first element is greater than 10 or when multiple elements need to be split.

To fix the program, the logic for splitting numbers and inserting their digits at the correct position needs to be corrected. Additionally, the function should properly handle the comparison to determine if the array can be sorted.

Correctness: **False**
