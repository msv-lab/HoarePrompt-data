### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting any number greater than or equal to 10 into its individual digits.

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of the main loop and the function `func_1`. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Main Loop:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It checks the result stored in list `b` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a`.
   - Iterates through the array `a` and processes each element.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it attempts to split it into its digits and insert them into a new list `c`.
   - The logic for inserting digits is flawed. Specifically:
     - It checks if the tens digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` before inserting both digits.
     - It does not handle the insertion correctly, especially when the list `c` is not yet fully populated.
   - After processing the array, it checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted.
   - It appends `1` to `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The function does not correctly handle the insertion of digits. It should always split numbers greater than 10 and insert the digits in the correct order.
   - The logic for checking if the tens digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` is flawed. It should not rely on the last element in `c` to decide whether to split the number.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where the array initially contains numbers like `100` or `200` correctly. It should split these into `[1, 0, 0]` and `[2, 0, 0]` respectively.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - The sorting check is performed after processing the array, but due to the incorrect insertion logic, the list `c` is not always correctly formed, leading to incorrect results.

#### Counterexample:
The provided counterexample shows that the program fails for the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The expected output is `YES`, but the program outputs `NO`. This is due to the incorrect logic for splitting and inserting digits.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case due to the flawed logic for splitting and inserting digits. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
