Reasoning:
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation. The function `func_1` does not handle all cases properly, especially the conditions for splitting numbers and maintaining the order of the array.

Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program attempts to split numbers only if they are greater than 10 and based on some conditions related to the previous element. However, the conditions are not correctly implemented to ensure that the array can be sorted by splitting the numbers. For example, the program checks if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y <= x`, which does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after splitting.

2. **Handling of Single-Digit Numbers**: The program correctly handles single-digit numbers by appending them directly to the list `c`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program correctly sorts the list `c` and compares it to the original processed list to determine if the array can be sorted. However, due to the incorrect splitting logic, this comparison might not yield the correct result.

4. **State Management**: The program maintains a list `b` to store the results for each test case. This part is correctly implemented.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Iterate through the array and split any number greater than 9 into its digits.
- After processing the array by splitting numbers, check if the array is sorted.
- The splitting should be done without any conditions that prevent the array from being sorted.

Given the issues with the splitting logic, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation.

Correctness: **False**
