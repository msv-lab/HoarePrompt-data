The function `func_1` reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It processes the list `a` by potentially splitting two-digit numbers into their tens and units digits under certain conditions, sorts the resulting list, and checks if the original processed list is already sorted. It appends `1` to a list `b` if the processed list is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`.
