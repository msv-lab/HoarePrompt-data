The code snippet assigns the value of `int(a[i] / 10)` to `y`. Given that `a[i]` is greater than 10, `y` will be the integer division of `a[i]` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is an empty list; `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10.**
