Reasoning:

The program attempts to determine if the given array can be sorted in non-descending order by performing the specified operation any number of times. However, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not correctly implement the required operations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Splitting Logic**: The function attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their digits and insert them in the same position. However, the current logic does not correctly handle the insertion of digits into the list `c`. Instead of inserting the digits at the correct position, it simply appends them to the end of the list. This results in incorrect transformations of the array.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The function checks if the transformed list `c` is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of `c` (`d`). However, since the transformation logic is incorrect, this comparison does not accurately reflect whether the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

3. **Index Handling**: The function uses an index `n` to keep track of the position in the list `c`. However, this index is not correctly updated when digits are inserted, leading to incorrect logic for comparing digits with the previous element.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the first element is greater than 10 or when multiple elements need to be split.

To fix the program, the logic for splitting numbers and inserting their digits at the correct position needs to be corrected. Additionally, the function should properly handle the comparison to determine if the array can be sorted.

Correctness: **False**
