Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `n` is 2, 3, or 4; `c` is the original list with `a[i]` appended to it.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `n` has been incremented by 1, so if `n` was originally 1, 2, 3, or 4, it is now 2, 3, 4, or 5 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
