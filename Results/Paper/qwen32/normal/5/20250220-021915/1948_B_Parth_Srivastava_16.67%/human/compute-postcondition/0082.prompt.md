Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is either 0 or greater than 0; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0; `n` is 1 or 2, where `n` is 2 if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `n` is 1; `c` is a list that contains `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, or just the first element of `a` if `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or if `y` > `x`. If `i` > 0 and `a[i]` > 10, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0; `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4; `c` is a list that contains `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, or just the first element of `a` if `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or if `y` > `x`. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` > 0, `x` is appended to `c` and `n` is set to 3 or 4 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is incremented by 1 after being set to 2 if `y` <= `x`, or 1 otherwise. If `y >= c[n - 1]`, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `i == 0` and `a[i]` > 10, `n` is 3 or 4 and `x` is appended to `c`. If `i > 0` and `a[i]` > 10, `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 0; if `i == 0` and `a[i]` > 10, `c` includes `a[i]` as an additional element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0; `n` is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6; `c` is a list that includes all previous elements. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` > 0, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element if `y` >= `c[n - 1]`, and `x` is appended to `c` and `n` is set to 3 or 4 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is incremented by 1 after being set to 2 if `y` <= `x`, or 1 otherwise. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` == 0, `c` includes `y` and `x` as its last two elements if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `a[i]` <= 10, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` == 0 and `y` <= `x`, `n` is 3, 4, 5, or 6. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` == 0 and `y` > `x`, `n` is 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` > 0, `n` is 2, 3, or 4. If `a[i]` <= 10, `n` is 2, 3, or 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
