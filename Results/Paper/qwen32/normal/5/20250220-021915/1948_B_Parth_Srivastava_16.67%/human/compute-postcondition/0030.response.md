The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `c`. Since `c` was initially an empty list, it will now contain the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`; `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10; `y` is greater than `x`.**
