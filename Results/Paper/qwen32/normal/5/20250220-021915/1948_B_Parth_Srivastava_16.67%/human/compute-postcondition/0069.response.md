Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4; `c` is a list that contains `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, or just the first element of `a` if `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or if `y` > `x`. If `y >= c[n - 1]`, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` > 0, `x` is appended to `c` and `n` is set to 3 or 4 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is incremented by 1 after being set to 2 if `y` <= `x`, or 1 otherwise. If `y` > `x` and `a[i]` > 10, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `a[i]` is not greater than 10, `c` remains unchanged.**
