The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `c`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `x`, `y`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `c` is an empty list.**
