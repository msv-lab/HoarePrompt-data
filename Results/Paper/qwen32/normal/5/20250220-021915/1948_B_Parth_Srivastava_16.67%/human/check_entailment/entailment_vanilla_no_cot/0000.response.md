Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The main issues are:

1. The function `func_1()` does not handle the operation of splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 correctly. The logic for splitting the numbers and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed.

2. The condition checks and the logic for appending elements to the list `c` are not correctly implemented. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the insertion of digits in the same position and does not ensure that the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations.

3. The program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the allowed operation. It only checks if the initial transformation (which is not correctly implemented) results in a sorted array.

To correctly solve the problem, one should implement a strategy that repeatedly applies the operation to split numbers and checks if the array can be sorted. This might involve a more complex approach, such as a backtracking algorithm or a simulation of the operation until no more changes can be made or a sorted array is achieved.
