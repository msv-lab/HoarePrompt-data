The code snippet appends `a[i]` to the list `c`. This means the list `c` will now contain the element `a[i]` at the end of the list. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation, and the other variables retain their initial states unless they are directly involved in the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`; `c` is a list containing `a[i]`; `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0; `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `y` is greater than `x`**
