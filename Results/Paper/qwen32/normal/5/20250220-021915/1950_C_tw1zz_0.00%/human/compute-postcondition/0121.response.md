Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time and it is not equal to '01'; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `time` is a string. If `h` equals '02', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '04', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '05', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is any of '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', then `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is any of '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', then `h1` is `h` minus 12 and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is not any of the specified values, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.**
