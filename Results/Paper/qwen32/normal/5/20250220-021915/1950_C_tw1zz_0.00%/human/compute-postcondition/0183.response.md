Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; if `h` is '17', `time` is set to 'PM' and `h1` is set to '05'. If `h` is '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `time` is set to 'PM' and `h1` is set to '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively. If `h` is '00', `time` is set to 'PM' and `h1` is set to '12'. Otherwise, `time` is set to 'PM' if `h` is one of '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', and `h1` remains unchanged.**
