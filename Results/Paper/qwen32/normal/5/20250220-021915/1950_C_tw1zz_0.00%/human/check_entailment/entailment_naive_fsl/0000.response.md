Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conversion of 24-hour format to 12-hour format for several edge cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly assigns "PM" to the time "00:00" and "00:59". According to the problem description, "00:00" should be converted to "12:00 AM" and "00:59" should be converted to "12:59 AM". 

Here is an example of the failure:

- Input: `00:00`
- Expected Output: `12:00 AM`
- Actual Output: `12:00 PM`

- Input: `00:59`
- Expected Output: `12:59 AM`
- Actual Output: `12:59 PM`

Additionally, the program does not handle leading zeros correctly for hours 1 to 9 in the PM range. For example, "13:00" should be converted to "01:00 PM", but the program will output "1:00 PM" without the leading zero.

To correct these issues, the program should handle the conversion more efficiently and correctly, for example using modulo operations and conditional checks to determine the correct hour and period (AM/PM).
