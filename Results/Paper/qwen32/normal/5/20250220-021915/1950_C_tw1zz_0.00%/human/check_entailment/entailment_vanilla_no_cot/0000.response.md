Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct in converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format, but there is a mistake in the handling of the '00' hour. According to the problem description, '00:00' should be converted to '12:00 AM', not '12:00 PM'. Here is the problematic part of the code:

```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'PM'
```

This should be:

```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'AM'
```

Apart from this mistake, the rest of the code correctly handles the conversion for all other hours.
