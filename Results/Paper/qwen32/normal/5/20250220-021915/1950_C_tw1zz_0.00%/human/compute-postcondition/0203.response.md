The code snippet assigns an empty string to `h1` and keeps the value of `m1` unchanged. Thus, `h1` is now an empty string, and `m1` retains its original value. All other variables remain as they were initially described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '01' or any hour from '02' to '11', otherwise 'PM'; `h1` is an empty string.**
