The code snippet assigns `h1` the value of an empty string and `m1` the value of `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is a string. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '05', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is any of '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', then `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is any of '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', then `h1` is `h` minus 12 and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is not any of the specified values, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings; `h1` is an empty string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time as a string.**
