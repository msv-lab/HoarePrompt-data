Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '23', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '11'. Otherwise, `time` is 'PM' if `h` is '00', otherwise `time` remains ''; `h1` is '12' if `h` is '00', otherwise `h1` remains an empty string.**
