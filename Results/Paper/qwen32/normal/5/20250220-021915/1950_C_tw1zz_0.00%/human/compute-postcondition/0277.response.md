To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440. This represents the total number of minutes past midnight.
2. `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string.
3. `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string.
4. `m1` is the minute part of the input time.
5. The variables `time` and `h1` are determined based on the value of `h`:
   - If `h` is '01' to '12', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is the same as `h`.
   - If `h` is '13' to '23', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is the corresponding 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is '00', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '12'.

### Print Statement:
```
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Analysis:
- `h1` is the hour part in 12-hour format.
- `m` is the minute part as a string.
- `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part.

### Output Description:
The print statement will concatenate `h1`, `':'`, `m`, `' '`, and `time` without any separators (`sep=''`).

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume an example where `t` is 1330. This means 13 hours and 30 minutes past midnight.
- `h` would be '13'.
- `m` would be '30'.
- Since `h` is '13', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '01'.

So, the print statement will output:
```
01:30 PM
```

### General Case:
Based on the initial state and the print statement, the output will be in the format of a 12-hour time with AM/PM, where `h1` is the hour part in 12-hour format, `m` is the minute part, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

### Final Output:
Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour part in 12-hour format, m is the minute part, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM')**
