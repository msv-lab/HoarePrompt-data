The code snippet assigns the string `'12'` to the variable `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is ''; `h1` is '12'; `m1` is the minute part of the input time as a string.**
