Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `h1` is an empty string; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time.**

Natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged, as does `h` and `m`. The variable `h1` is set to an empty string, and `m1` is set to the same value as `m`.
