The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Since `t` was initially 1, it becomes 2 after the increment.

Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999]. If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is [100000000, -99999999] if `x` is odd, or `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` is 0. `t` is 2 and `i` is 3.**
