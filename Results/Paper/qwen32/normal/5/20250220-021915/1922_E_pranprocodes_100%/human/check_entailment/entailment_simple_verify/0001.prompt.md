You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided program attempts to construct such an array based on the binary representation of `X`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code attempts to construct an array based on the binary representation of `X`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`.

2. **Array Construction:**
   - It initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values respectively.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the resulting array.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `X` by 2 if `X` is even, or subtract 1 if `X` is odd, appending `max` or `min` to the array accordingly.
   - The values of `max` and `min` are decremented or incremented respectively after each append.
   - The process continues until `X` becomes 1.
   - The array `ans` is then reversed and printed.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the array `t` is printed.
   - The elements of the array `ans` are printed.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The key aspect of the problem is to ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided code constructs an array based on the binary representation of `X`, but it does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly `X`.

- **Binary Representation and Increasing Subsequences:**
  - The binary representation of `X` can be used to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but the method used in the code does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly `X`.
  - The code simply alternates between appending `max` and `min` based on whether `X` is even or odd, which does not directly correspond to a method for constructing an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - For small values of `X`, the code might work by chance, but for larger values of `X`, the constructed array will not necessarily have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
  - The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
