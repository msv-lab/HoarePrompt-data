The code snippet provided is `ans.reverse()`. This function call reverses the order of elements in the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `x` is 1
- `max` is 99999998
- `min` is -99999999
- `ans` is [100000000, -100000000, 99999999]
- `t` is 3
- `i` is 3

After executing `ans.reverse()`, the list `ans` will have its elements in the opposite order. The other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged.

The new value of `ans` will be [99999999, -100000000, 100000000].

Output State: **`x` is 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [99999999, -100000000, 100000000], `t` is 3, `i` is 3**.
