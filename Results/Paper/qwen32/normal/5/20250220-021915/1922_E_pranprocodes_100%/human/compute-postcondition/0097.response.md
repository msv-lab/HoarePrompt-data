Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000], `t` is 1, `i` is 3.**

In simpler terms, the value of `max` is decreased by 1. If `x` is even, `max` is now 99999998. If `x` is odd, `max` is now 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
