Output State: **`x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` is even, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000 and 99999999 if `x` is odd, and `t` is 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `max` has been decremented by 1, making it 99999998 regardless of whether `x` is even or odd. All other variables remain unchanged.
