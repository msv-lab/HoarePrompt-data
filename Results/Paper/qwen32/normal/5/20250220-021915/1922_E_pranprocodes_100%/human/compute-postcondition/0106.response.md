Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999997 if `x` is even, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 99999998] if `x` is even, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999, 99999999] if `x` is odd, or `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000, 99999999] if `x` is 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `x` is even, `max` changes from 99999998 to 99999997, and if `x` is odd, `max` changes from 99999999 to 99999998. All other variables remain unchanged.
