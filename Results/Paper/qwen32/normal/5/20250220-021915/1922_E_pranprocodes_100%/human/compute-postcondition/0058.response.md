The code snippet `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Given the initial state, we need to consider both scenarios for `x`: whether it is even or odd.

- If `x` is even, `max` is initially 99999999. After decrementing, `max` becomes 99999998.
- If `x` is odd, `max` is initially 100000000. After decrementing, `max` becomes 99999999.

The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **if `x` is even, `x` is an input integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999]`, `t` is 1, `i` is 2; otherwise, `x` is an input integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is `[-100000000, 100000000]`, `t` is 1, `i` is 2.**
