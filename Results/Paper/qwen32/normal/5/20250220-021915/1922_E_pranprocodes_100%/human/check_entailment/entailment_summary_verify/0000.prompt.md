You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    2
    
    5
    
    13
    
    37

Output

    1
    0
    3
    0 1 0
    5
    2 2 3 4 2
    7
    -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `X` (where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). For each test case, it performs a series of operations to reduce `X` to 1, appending either a maximum or minimum value to a list based on whether `X` is even or odd, respectively. It then prints the number of operations performed and the list of appended values in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program attempts to solve the problem by using a binary representation of the number of increasing subsequences (X). However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Representation**: The code tries to construct an array based on the binary representation of X, but it does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The problem requires a more sophisticated method to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling of Odd and Even Cases**: The code alternates between appending the maximum and minimum values to the array based on whether X is odd or even. However, this approach does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if X is a large number, the binary representation approach might not yield a valid array of length at most 200.

4. **Array Length Constraint**: The problem specifies that the length of the array should be at most 200. The current approach does not guarantee that the length of the array will be within this constraint.

5. **Output Format**: The code correctly prints the length of the array and the array itself, but the logic to generate the array is flawed.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input `X = 5`. The correct output could be:
```
3
0 1 0
```
This array has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`. However, the given program will not produce this output or any other valid array for `X = 5`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee to produce an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X within the given constraints.
