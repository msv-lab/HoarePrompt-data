`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the number of even and odd operations, `ans` is a list of `max` and `min` values based on the operations in reversed order, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 2**.
