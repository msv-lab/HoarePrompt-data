The code `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Given the initial state, if `x` is even, `min` was -99999999, and if `x` is odd, `min` was -99999998. After the increment, if `x` is even, `min` becomes -99999998, and if `x` is odd, `min` becomes -99999997. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999997 if `x` is odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, -99999999] if `x` is even, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999, -99999998] if `x` is odd, or `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000, -99999998] if `x` is 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 3**.
