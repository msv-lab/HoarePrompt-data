Postcondition: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999]. If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is [100000000, -99999999] if `x` is odd, or `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` is 0. In both cases, `t` is 1 and `i` is 3.**
