The code snippet appends the built-in Python function `min` to the list `ans`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The initial state specifies that `x` is an input integer not equal to 1, and this condition still holds true after the execution of the code. The list `ans` now contains the function `min` as its element.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; `ans` contains the function `min`.**
