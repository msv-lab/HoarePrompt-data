Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 0, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999] if `x` is odd, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000], `t` is 1, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `x` is no longer 1 but is now an integer not equal to 0. The values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` depend on whether the new value of `x` is even or odd, but they remain as specified in the initial state conditions relative to the new `x`. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
