### Reasoning:

The given problem asks to construct an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by using a binary representation approach to construct the array based on the value of `X`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max` is initialized to a large positive number (`100000000`).
   - `min` is initialized to a large negative number (`-100000000`).
   - `ans` is an empty list that will store the elements of the array.
   - `t` is a counter that keeps track of the number of elements in the array.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `X` is reduced to 1.
   - If `X` is even, the current `max` value is appended to `ans`, `max` is decremented, and `X` is halved.
   - If `X` is odd, the current `min` value is appended to `ans`, `min` is incremented, and `X` is decremented by 1.
   - The counter `t` is incremented in each iteration.

3. **Reverse the List**:
   - After the loop, the list `ans` is reversed to get the correct order of the array elements.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the array (`t`) is printed.
   - The elements of the array (`ans`) are printed.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be manipulated by carefully choosing the elements and their order. By appending either a maximum or minimum value based on the parity of `X`, the program effectively constructs an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with a few examples:

1. **For `X = 2`**:
   - `X` is even, so append `max` (100000000) to `ans`, decrement `max`, and halve `X`. Now `X = 1` and `ans = [100000000]`.
   - Reverse `ans` to get `[100000000]`.
   - Output: `1` (length) and `100000000` (array).

2. **For `X = 5`**:
   - `X` is odd, so append `min` (-100000000) to `ans`, increment `min`, and decrement `X`. Now `X = 4` and `ans = [-100000000]`.
   - `X` is even, so append `max` (100000000) to `ans`, decrement `max`, and halve `X`. Now `X = 2` and `ans = [-100000000, 100000000]`.
   - `X` is even, so append `max` (99999999) to `ans`, decrement `max`, and halve `X`. Now `X = 1` and `ans = [-100000000, 100000000, 99999999]`.
   - Reverse `ans` to get `[99999999, 100000000, -100000000]`.
   - Output: `3` (length) and `99999999 100000000 -100000000` (array).

The program seems to correctly handle the provided examples. However, the correctness of the program for all possible values of `X` up to \(10^{18}\) needs a deeper mathematical proof, which involves understanding that each binary operation (halving or decrementing) corresponds to a unique way of constructing increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided logic and the verification with examples, the program appears to be correct. However, a rigorous mathematical proof would be required to ensure correctness for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
