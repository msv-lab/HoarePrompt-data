Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = []
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(max)
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans.append(min)
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    ans.reverse()
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 1; `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the number of even and odd operations; `ans` is a list of `max` and `min` values based on the operations, but in reversed order; `t` is the total number of iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is 1, `max` is `100000000 - t_e`, `min` is `-100000000 + t_o`, `ans` is a list of `t` elements where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration, but in reversed order, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [99999999, -100000000, 100000000], `t` is 3, `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
