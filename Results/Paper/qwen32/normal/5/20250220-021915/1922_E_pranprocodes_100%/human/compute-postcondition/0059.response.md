Output State: **if `x` is even, `x` is an input integer not equal to 1 and divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999]`, `t` is 1, `i` is 2; otherwise, `x` is an input integer not equal to 1 and divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is `[-100000000, 100000000]`, `t` is 1, `i` is 2.**

Natural Language: The value of `x` has been updated to be half of its original value, while all other variables (`max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The condition that determines the initial values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` based on whether `x` is even or not still holds.
