Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `t` is 3, `i` is 3. If `x` is even, `x` is updated to `x // 2`, `max` becomes 99999997`, `min` remains -99999999`, and `ans` is updated to `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]`. If `x` is odd, `max` becomes 99999998`, `min` remains -99999998`, and `ans` is updated to `[100000000, -99999999, 99999999]`. If `x` is 0, `ans` is updated to `[-100000000, -100000000, 99999999]`. If `x` is odd and not equal to 1, `max` becomes 99999999`, `min` becomes -99999997`, and `ans` is updated to `[100000000, -99999999, -99999998]`. If `x` is even and not equal to 1, `max` becomes 99999998`, `min` becomes -99999998`, and `ans` is updated to `[100000000, 99999999, -99999999]`. If `x` is 0, `ans` is updated to `[-100000000, -100000000, -99999998]`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
