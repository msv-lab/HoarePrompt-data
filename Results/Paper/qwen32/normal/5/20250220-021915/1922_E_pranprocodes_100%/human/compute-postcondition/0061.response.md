The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` is either `-100000000` or `-99999999` based on the condition of `x`. Therefore, after incrementing, `min` becomes `-99999999` or `-99999998` respectively. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; if `x` is even, `x` is now half of its initial value, `max` is `99999999`, `min` is `-99999999` or `-99999998`, `ans` is `[100000000, -100000000]` or `[-100000000, -99999999]`, `t` is `1`, `i` is `2`.**
