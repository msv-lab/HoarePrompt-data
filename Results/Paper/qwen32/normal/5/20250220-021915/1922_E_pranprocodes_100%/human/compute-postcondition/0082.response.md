The code snippet provided reassigns `ans` to an empty list, effectively clearing any previous values it held. The other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [], `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 3.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` has been reset to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
