The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer greater than 1.
- `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even, and 100000000 if `x` was odd.
- `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x` was originally even, -99999999 if `x` was odd or `x` was originally odd.
- `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was even, or 100000000 and `min` if `x` was odd and `x` was originally even, or -100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was odd and `x` was originally odd, or -100000000 and `min` if `x` was odd and `x` was originally odd.
- `t` is 2.

The value of `min` is appended to `ans`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be:
- [100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` was even.
- [100000000, `min`, `min`] if `x` was odd and `x` was originally even.
- [-100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` was odd and `x` was originally odd.
- [-100000000, `min`, `min`] if `x` was odd and `x` was originally odd.

Since the value of `min` is the same in the last three cases, we can simplify the description to:
- [100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` was even.
- [100000000, `min`, `min`] if `x` was odd.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even, and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x` was originally even, -99999999 if `x` was odd or `x` was originally odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` was even, or [100000000, `min`, `min`] if `x` was odd, `t` is 2.**
