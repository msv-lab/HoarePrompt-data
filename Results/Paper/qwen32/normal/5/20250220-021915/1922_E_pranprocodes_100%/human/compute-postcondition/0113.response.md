To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables based on the input `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Each iteration will either halve `x` if it is even or decrement `x` by 1 if it is odd, appending either `max` or `min` to the list `ans` accordingly.

Let's analyze the loop's behavior with respect to the initial conditions and the provided iterations:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x`: Input integer
   - `max`: 100000000
   - `min`: -100000000
   - `ans`: []
   - `t`: 0
   - `i`: 3

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
   - If `x` is even, `max` is appended to `ans` and then decremented by 1. `x` is halved.
   - If `x` is odd, `min` is appended to `ans` and then incremented by 1. `x` is decremented by 1.
   - `t` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Final State:**
   - The loop will stop when `x` becomes 1.
   - The final value of `x` will be 1.
   - `max` and `min` will have been adjusted based on the number of even and odd iterations, but their exact values depend on the specific sequence of even and odd numbers encountered.
   - `ans` will contain a sequence of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration.
   - `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `i` remains unchanged at 3.

Since the exact number of iterations and the sequence of even and odd numbers depend on the input `x`, we can't determine the exact final values of `max` and `min` without knowing `x`. However, we can describe the state in a general form.

### Final Output State
- `x` will be 1.
- `max` and `min` will be adjusted based on the number of even and odd iterations.
- `ans` will contain a list of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration.
- `t` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed.
- `i` will remain 3.

Given the initial input `x`, the loop will execute until `x` becomes 1, appending either `max` or `min` to `ans` based on whether `x` is even or odd, and adjusting `max` and `min` accordingly.

**Output State:** `x` is 1, `max` is adjusted based on the number of even iterations, `min` is adjusted based on the number of odd iterations, `ans` is a list of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 3.

To provide a concrete example, let's assume `x` is 6 (an even number):

- Iteration 1: `x` is 6 (even), append `max` (100000000) to `ans`, `max` becomes 99999999, `x` becomes 3, `t` becomes 1.
- Iteration 2: `x` is 3 (odd), append `min` (-100000000) to `ans`, `min` becomes -99999999, `x` becomes 2, `t` becomes 2.
- Iteration 3: `x` is 2 (even), append `max` (99999999) to `ans`, `max` becomes 99999998, `x` becomes 1, `t` becomes 3.

**Output State:** `x` is 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [100000000, -100000000, 99999999], `t` is 3, `i` is 3.

Thus, the final output state in the general form is:

Output State: **x is 1, max is adjusted based on the number of even iterations, min is adjusted based on the number of odd iterations, ans is a list of max and min values corresponding to each iteration, t is the total number of iterations, i is 3.**
