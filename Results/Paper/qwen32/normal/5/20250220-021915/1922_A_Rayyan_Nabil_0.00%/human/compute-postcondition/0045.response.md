The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** (assuming `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration)

However, since the problem does not specify the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**
