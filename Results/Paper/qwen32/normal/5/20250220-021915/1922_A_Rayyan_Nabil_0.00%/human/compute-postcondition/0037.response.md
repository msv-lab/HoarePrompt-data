Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, otherwise `l` is 'NO'; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. The values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
