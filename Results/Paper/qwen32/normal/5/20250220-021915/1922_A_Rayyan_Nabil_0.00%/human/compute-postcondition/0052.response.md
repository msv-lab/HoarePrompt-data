To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- The initial state describes a condition to determine the value of a variable `l`.
- `l` is set to 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
- Otherwise, `l` is set to 'NO'.

### Code Snippet:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the value of `l`.

### Analysis:
- Since the value of `l` is determined by the condition described in the initial state, we need to understand what that condition checks.
- The condition checks if there is any index `i` in the lists `a`, `b`, and `c` where the elements at that index in `a` and `b` are both different from the element at the same index in `c`.
- If such an index exists, `l` is set to 'YES'; otherwise, `l` is set to 'NO'.
- The code snippet simply prints the value of `l`.

### Output:
- Based on the initial state, the value of `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- Since the exact lists `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `l` (whether it is 'YES' or 'NO').
- However, we know the value of `l` will be one of these two based on the condition provided.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the lists `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise 'NO')**
