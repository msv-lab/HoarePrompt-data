The code snippet `a = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `a`. The other variables `l`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, otherwise `l` is 'NO'; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value of the user input.**
