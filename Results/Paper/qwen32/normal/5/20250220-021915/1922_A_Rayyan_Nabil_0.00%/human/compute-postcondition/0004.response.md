The code snippet `a = input()` assigns the new input value to the variable `a`. This new input value is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `l` is 'YES'**.
