The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for `n` to ensure the loop continues is that `n` must be greater than 2.

The variable `l` is not part of the loop head and its value depends on the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted here.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
