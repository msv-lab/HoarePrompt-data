The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, and it must still be less than `n`.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop head, and `l` is determined by the condition inside the loop body, which does not affect the loop's continuation. Therefore, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and `l` is `'YES'` if `a[i_prev + 1]` is not equal to `c[i_prev + 1]` and `b[i_prev + 1]` is not equal to `c[i_prev + 1]`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.**
