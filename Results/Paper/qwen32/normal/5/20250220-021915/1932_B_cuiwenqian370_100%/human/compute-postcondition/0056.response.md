The code snippet provided appends the string representation of `last_year` to the `results` list. This means that after the execution of the code, the `results` list will have an additional element, which is the string version of `last_year`.

Given the initial state, the `results` list already contains two elements: the original `last_year` and the final `last_year` after all iterations. After the code snippet is executed, `results` will have one more element, which is the string representation of `last_year`.

All other variables (`i`, `T`, `t`, `data`, `index`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, and `last_year` will have been updated `n-1` times according to the loop's formula. The variable `T` will have been decremented by `n` and then by 1, as described in the initial state. The `results` list will contain the original `last_year` before the loop started as its first element, the final `last_year` after all iterations as its second element, and the string representation of `last_year` as its third element. All other variables (`t`, `data`, `index`, `a`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.**
