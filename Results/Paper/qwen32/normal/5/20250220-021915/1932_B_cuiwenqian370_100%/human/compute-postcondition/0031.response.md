Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2*n + 3`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is `(a[0] + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `next_year` is `(a[0] + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`, which is calculated as `(a[0] + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
