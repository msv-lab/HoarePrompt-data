The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `2 + n - 1` (which is `1 + n`), meaning the loop has just finished executing.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the starting value of the loop, which is 1. The other variables mentioned in the state description (`t`, `n`, `data`, `T`, `results`, `a`, `last_year`, `next_year`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 2 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the integer value of `data[index + i - 2]` for 1 <= i <= n; `last_year` is `(a[0] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`; `i` is 1**
