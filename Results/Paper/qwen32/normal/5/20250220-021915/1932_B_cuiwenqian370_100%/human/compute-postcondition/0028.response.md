The code assigns the value of `a[0]` to `last_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2*n + 3`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is `a[0]`.**
