The code snippet `index += n` increments the value of the `index` variable by the value of `n`. This change affects the `index` variable directly, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 2 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]; `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the integer value of `data[index + i - 2]` for 1 <= i <= n.**
