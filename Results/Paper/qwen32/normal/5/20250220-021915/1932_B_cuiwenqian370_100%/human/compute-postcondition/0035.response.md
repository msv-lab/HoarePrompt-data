The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2*n + 3`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is `(a[0] + 2*a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `next_year` is `(a[0] + 2*a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `i` is 3**
