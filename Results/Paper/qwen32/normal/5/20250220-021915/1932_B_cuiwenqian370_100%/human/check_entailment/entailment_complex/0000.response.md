### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings (`data`). This is efficient and suitable for the problem constraints.
   - It then processes each test case one by one using the `index` variable to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs on the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
     - It works as follows:
       - `last_year + 1` ensures we start checking from the year right after the last sign occurred.
       - Adding `a[i] - 1` ensures that we round up to the next multiple of `a[i]`.
       - The division and multiplication by `a[i]` ensure that we get the correct multiple.

4. **Updating `last_year`:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.

5. **Storing and Printing Results:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints all results, each on a new line.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Signs: `3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18`
  - Calculations:
    - `last_year = 3`
    - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (2nd sign)
    - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (3rd sign)
    - `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (4th sign)
    - `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (5th sign)
    - `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (6th sign)
  - Result: `36`

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Signs: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
  - Calculations:
    - `last_year = 1`
    - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2` (2nd sign)
    - `next_year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3` (3rd sign)
    - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4` (4th sign)
    - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5` (5th sign)
  - Result: `5`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Signs: `1, 1, 1, 1, 1`
  - Calculations:
    - `last_year = 1`
    - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 2` (2nd sign)
    - `next_year = (2 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 3` (3rd sign)
    - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 4` (4th sign)
    - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 5` (5th sign)
  - Result: `5`

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - Signs: `50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006`
  - Calculations:
    - `last_year = 50`
    - `next_year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60` (2nd sign)
    - `next_year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 771` (3rd sign)
    - `next_year = (771 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 900` (4th sign)
    - `next_year = (900 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1006` (5th sign)
    - `next_year = (1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012` (6th sign)
  - Result: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens, as verified by the example test cases.

**Correctness: True**
