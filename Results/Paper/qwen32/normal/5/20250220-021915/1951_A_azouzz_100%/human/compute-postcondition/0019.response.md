Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2 or `cnt1` is odd, and `cnt1` is not equal to 1. If '11' is a substring of `s`, then '11' is present in `s`. Otherwise, '11' is not a substring of `s`.**
