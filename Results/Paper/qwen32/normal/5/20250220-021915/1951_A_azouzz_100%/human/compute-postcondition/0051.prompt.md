You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` takes two integer arguments, `start` and `end`, such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. These integers represent the range of folder names (which should be digits) to be considered for processing HTML files within the current working directory.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2:
            print('NO')
        elif cnt1 == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `s` is the string input by the user in the last iteration, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the last `s`. The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` accepts two integer parameters, `start` and `end`, where `start` is less than or equal to `end`. It processes HTML files within folders named with digits in the range from `start` to `end` in the current working directory.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
