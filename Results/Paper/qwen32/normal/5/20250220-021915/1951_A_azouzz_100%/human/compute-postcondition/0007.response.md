The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several variables and conditions (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and will be output as is.
3. None of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
