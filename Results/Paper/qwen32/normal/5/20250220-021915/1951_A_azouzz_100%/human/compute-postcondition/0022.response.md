Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, no additional changes are made. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or `cnt1` is odd, no additional changes are made except that if `cnt1` is not equal to 1, '11' is a substring of `s` if and only if '11' is present in `s`.**
