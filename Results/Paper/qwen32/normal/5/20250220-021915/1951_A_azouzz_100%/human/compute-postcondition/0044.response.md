The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and directly outputs the string `'YES'`.
2. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` are mentioned in the initial state but do not affect the output of the `print` statement.
3. Since no computation or condition is applied to these variables in the `print` statement, their values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
