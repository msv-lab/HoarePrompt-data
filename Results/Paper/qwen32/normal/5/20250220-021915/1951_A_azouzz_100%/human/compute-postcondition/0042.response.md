The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string 'NO'.

Since the print statement is not influenced by any of the variables defined in the initial state, the output will be exactly 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
