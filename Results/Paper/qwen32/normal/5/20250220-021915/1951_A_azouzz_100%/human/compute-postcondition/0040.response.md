The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`, which means it will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **YES**
