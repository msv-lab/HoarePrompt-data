Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the new integer input by the user, `s` is the new string input by the user, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. Whether '11' is in `s` or not, the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` retain their values as described.**
