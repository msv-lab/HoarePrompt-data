Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is `True`, and at the current index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. `nums` is a list created by concatenating the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` with the integer `arr[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the `nums` list is now composed of the digits of the number at `arr[i - 1]` followed by the number at `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
