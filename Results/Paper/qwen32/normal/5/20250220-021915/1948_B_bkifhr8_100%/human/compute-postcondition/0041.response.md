The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` assigns the value of `nums[0]` to the element at index `i-1` in the list `arr`. This changes the value of `arr[i-1]` but does not affect any other variables unless they are directly dependent on `arr[i-1]`.

Given the initial state, the value of `arr[i-1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The state of `ans` also remains unchanged unless the condition that `nums` is not sorted is triggered, which is not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i-1]` updated to `nums[0]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` remains `True`.**
