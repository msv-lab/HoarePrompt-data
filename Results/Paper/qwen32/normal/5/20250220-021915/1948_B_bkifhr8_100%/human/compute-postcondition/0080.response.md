The code snippet takes the integer at index `i-1` from the list `arr`, converts it to a string, then converts each character of that string back to an integer, and creates a list of these integers. It then appends the integer at index `i` of `arr` to this list. The variable `nums` is assigned this new list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `i + 1`

After the code snippet is executed:
- `nums` is a list where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i-1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`
- All other variables retain their initial values

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` is a list where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i-1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`**
