Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the value of `t`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list created by converting the integer at index `i - 1` of `arr` into a list of its digits and appending the integer at index `i` of `arr` to this list, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False.**
