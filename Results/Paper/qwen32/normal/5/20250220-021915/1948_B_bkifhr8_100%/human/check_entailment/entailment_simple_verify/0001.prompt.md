You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The output state after all iterations is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each of the `t` test cases, based on whether the condition was met for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserting them back into the array in the same position.

### Key Points:
1. **Splitting Elements**: If an element is 10 or greater, it can be split into its digits. For example, 12 can be split into 1 and 2.
2. **Sorting Check**: The goal is to check if it is possible to sort the array using the above operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, it tries to split the previous element and checks if the resulting array (after insertion of digits) can be sorted.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program's logic for handling the splitting and checking is flawed. It only checks if the digits of the previous element and the current element can be sorted together, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.
2. **Insufficient Checks**: The program does not fully simulate the process of splitting and reordering the array to ensure that the entire array can be sorted. It only checks a limited condition.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program might fail for certain edge cases where multiple splits and reordering are necessary to sort the array.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
