The value of `m` is updated to the integer value of the input provided. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers modified based on the concatenation and sorting checks within the loop, `ans` is `False` if any `nums` was unsorted during the loop, otherwise `True`**
