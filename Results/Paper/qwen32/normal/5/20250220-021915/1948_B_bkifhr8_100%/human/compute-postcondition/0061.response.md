The code snippet `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`. 

This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, or `ans`. It only modifies `arr` by replacing its previous value with the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `ans` is a boolean value indicating whether all `nums` constructed during the loop were sorted.**
