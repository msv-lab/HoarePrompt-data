Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `False`, `nums` is a list created by concatenating the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` with the integer `arr[i]`. The current value of `nums` is not sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
