The code snippet assigns `False` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`.**
