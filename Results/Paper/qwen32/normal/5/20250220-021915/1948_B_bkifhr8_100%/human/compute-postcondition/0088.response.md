To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the state based on the input values.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each iteration, it performs the following:
1. Reads an integer `m`.
2. Reads a list of `m` integers `arr`.
3. Checks if the list `arr` can be modified by concatenating each element with its predecessor and sorting the concatenated list. If any concatenated list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False`.
4. Prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True`, otherwise prints 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to process the remaining test cases in the same manner. Therefore, after all `t` iterations, the output state will reflect the results of all these test cases.

The output state after all the iterations will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, indicating whether the condition was met for each one.

Output State: **The output state after all iterations is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each of the `t` test cases, based on whether the condition was met for each test case.**

In simpler terms, the output state will be a list of `t` results, each being either 'YES' or 'NO', corresponding to whether the condition was satisfied for each test case.
