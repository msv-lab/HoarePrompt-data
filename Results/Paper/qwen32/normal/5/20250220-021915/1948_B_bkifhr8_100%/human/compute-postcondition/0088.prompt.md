Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers modified based on the concatenation and sorting checks within the loop, and `ans` is `False` if any `nums` was unsorted during the loop, otherwise `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers that may have been modified based on the loop's conditions, and `ans` is a boolean value indicating whether all `nums` constructed during the loop were sorted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers that may have been modified based on the conditions described, and `ans` is `True` if no concatenated list `nums` was found to be unsorted; otherwise, `ans` is `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
