Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is assigned the value of `t`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is False; `i` is `m - 2`; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
