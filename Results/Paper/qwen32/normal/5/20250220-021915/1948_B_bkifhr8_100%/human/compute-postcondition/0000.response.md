Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.**

Natural language: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
