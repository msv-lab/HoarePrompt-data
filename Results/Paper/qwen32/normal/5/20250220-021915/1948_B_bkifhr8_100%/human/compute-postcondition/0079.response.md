The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0 and will decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i - 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Given that the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been decremented from its value at the start of that iteration. Therefore, to get the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Since `m` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**
