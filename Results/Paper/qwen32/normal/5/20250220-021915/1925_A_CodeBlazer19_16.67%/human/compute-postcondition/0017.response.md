The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state of `s` and `t` remains unchanged, while `i` is already defined as `i + 1`. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values input by the user, split by a space. 

Output State: **`s` is the string of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
