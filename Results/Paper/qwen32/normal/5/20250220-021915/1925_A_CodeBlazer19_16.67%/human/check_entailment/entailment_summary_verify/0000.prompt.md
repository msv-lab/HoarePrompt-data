You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It constructs a string `s` containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet and prints the string `n` times if `k` is 1, or prints the string twice if `n` is greater than 1 and once if `n` is 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Let's analyze the code and see why it fails:

1. **Loop for generating the string `s`:**
   ```python
   for j in range(97, k + 97):
       s += chr(j)
   ```
   This loop generates a string `s` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For example, if `k = 3`, then `s` becomes `"abc"`.

2. **Handling the case when `k == 1`:**
   ```python
   if k == 1:
       print(n * s)
   ```
   If `k == 1`, the program prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the output is `"aaa"`. This is correct because the only possible string of length `n` using the character `'a'` is `"aaa"`, which is indeed a subsequence of `"aaa"`.

3. **Handling the case when `k > 1`:**
   ```python
   else:
       print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
   ```
   If `k > 1`, the program prints the string `s` repeated either once or twice depending on whether `n` is 1 or greater than 1. Specifically:
   - If `n == 1`, it prints `s` once.
   - If `n > 1`, it prints `s` twice.

   This logic is incorrect for generating a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` generated is `"ab"`. Repeating `"ab"` twice results in `"abab"`, which does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`).

### Counterexample:

Consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`:
- The program outputs `"abab"`.
- The possible subsequences of length 2 that need to be included are `"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, and `"bb"`.
- `"abab"` does not contain `"aa"` and `"bb"` as subsequences.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case and possibly others. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
