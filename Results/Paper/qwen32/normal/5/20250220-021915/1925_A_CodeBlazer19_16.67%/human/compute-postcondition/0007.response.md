The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 98, `chr(98)` corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, the string `s` which was initially 'a' will now be 'ab'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `s` is the string 'ab'; `j` is 98**.
