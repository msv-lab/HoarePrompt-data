Output State: **`num` is assigned the value of `input()`, which is a string representing the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). The initial state of the test cases and their respective values remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `num` now holds the input string representing the number of test cases, while all other initial conditions remain the same.
