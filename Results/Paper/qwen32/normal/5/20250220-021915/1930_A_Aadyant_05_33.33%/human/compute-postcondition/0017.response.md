The code snippet appends the sum of the elements in `list2` to the `out` list. Given that `list2` contains specific integer values from `list1`, and `out` is initially an empty list, after the execution, `out` will contain one element, which is the sum of the elements in `list2`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is a list containing the sum of `list2`, `list2` contains the integer values of `list1[0]`, `list1[2]`, `list1[4]`, ..., `list1[2 * (a - 1)]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is the string input provided by the user.**
