Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is the string input provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the string input provided by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` and the newly appended integer value of `list1[2 * (i + 1)]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the string input provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, the newly appended integer value of `list1[2 * (i + 1)]`, and the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` appended again, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from `b`, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the string input provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
