You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive and the list length is between 2 and 50 inclusive, and returns `True` if the list is already sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the current array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and if it is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The program uses integer division and modulus operations to split the previous element into its digits.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it only handles 2-digit numbers and does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits.
   - Additionally, the logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect. It should insert all digits of the split number, not just the first two.

4. **Checking Sortedness:**
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to check if the array is sorted after attempting to split elements.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted after attempting to split elements, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits.
- The logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting numbers and inserting their digits back into the array, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all possible inputs.

Thus, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
