### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

#### Logic for Sorting:
- The program iterates through the array and checks if the current array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and if it is at least 10.
- If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

#### Splitting Logic:
- The program uses integer division and modulus operations to split the previous element into its digits.
- However, the current implementation only handles 2-digit numbers correctly. For example, if the number is 123, the program will incorrectly split it into 1 and 23, not 1, 2, and 3.
- The logic to insert the digits back into the array is also flawed because it only considers the first two digits of the number.

#### Checking Sortedness:
- The program uses the `func_1` function to check if the array is sorted after attempting to split elements.
- The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.

#### Output:
- The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted after attempting to split elements, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits.
- The logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect.

### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the `func_1` function correctly checks if a list is sorted.
- However, the annotations do not address the incorrect handling of numbers with more than 2 digits and the flawed insertion logic.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting numbers and inserting their digits back into the array, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program has issues with handling numbers with more than 2 digits and incorrectly inserting the digits back into the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
