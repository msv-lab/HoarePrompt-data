### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the annotated code to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the array is not sorted (checked by `func_1`), it checks if the current element and the previous element are in the wrong order and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Loop and Splitting Logic:**
   - The loop only checks the current and previous elements, and it only attempts to split once per iteration.
   - If multiple splits are needed, the loop does not re-evaluate the entire array after a split.
   - The loop does not handle the case where the split operation might affect the order of elements that were previously in order.

2. **Index Management:**
   - After splitting an element, the loop index `p` is not adjusted, which can lead to skipping elements or incorrect behavior.

3. **Example Failure:**
   - The provided example where the input is `12 3 45 67 89` should output `YES` because splitting each element results in a sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. However, the program does not perform these splits correctly and outputs `NO`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. It only attempts to split once per iteration and does not re-evaluate the entire array after a split, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

### Final:
Final: **False**
