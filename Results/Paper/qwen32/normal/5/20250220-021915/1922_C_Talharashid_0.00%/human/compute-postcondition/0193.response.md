The `while` loop in the given code will continue to execute as long as `start` is not equal to `end`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `start` and `end` such that `start != end`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 2`
- `end` is `0`

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` should not be equal to `end`. Since `start` is initially `len(lst) - 2` and `end` is `0`, the condition `start != end` is already satisfied as long as `len(lst) > 1` (which is given).

However, to ensure that the loop can proceed to the next iteration, we need to make sure that the changes made within the loop body will eventually lead to `start` equaling `end` at some point. But for the current state to allow the loop to execute one more time, no adjustment is needed to `start` and `end` as they are already in a state that satisfies `start != end`.

Thus, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration with respect to the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and key `start` with value `s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 2`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`. If `mini` was equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` remains 0. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111**
