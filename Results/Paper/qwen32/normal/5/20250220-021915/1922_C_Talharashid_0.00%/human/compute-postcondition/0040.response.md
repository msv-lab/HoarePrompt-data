Output State: **`start` is less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.**

In natural language, the value of `mini` is updated to be the smallest value among 11111111, the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` (if `start + 1` is within the bounds of `lst`), and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. The conditions on `start` and `end` remain the same.
