Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input; `start` is 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `s` is 0; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and the key `start` has the value `s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements; `start` is 1; `end` is `len(lst) - 1` which is at least 1; `inc` is 1; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` (if `start - 1` is greater than -1) and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` (if `start + 1 < len(lst)`), with 11111111 as the default value where applicable.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and the key `start` has the value `s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with at least 3 elements; `start` is 2; `end` is `len(lst) - 1` which is at least 2; `inc` is 1; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is `s + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start]` is `s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with at least 3 elements; `start` is `start + inc`; `end` is `len(lst) - 1` which is at least 2; `inc` is 1; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then the value of `d1[start]` is updated to `s + 1`. Otherwise, the value of `d1[start]` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
