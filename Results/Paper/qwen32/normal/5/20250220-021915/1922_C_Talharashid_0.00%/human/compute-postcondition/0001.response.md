The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used in the `range(t)` function. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure that the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`**
