The given code snippet updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `mini`. The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value (`11111111`) and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` remains 0 or is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `mini` is `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), 11111111)`**.
