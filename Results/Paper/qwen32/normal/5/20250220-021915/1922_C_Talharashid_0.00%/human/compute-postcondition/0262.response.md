To determine the state that allows the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `start != end` is true right before the loop begins. 

Given the provided state:
- `start` is 0
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `lst` is a list of integers with `len(lst) > 1`

The condition `start != end` will be true if `start` is not equal to `end`. Since `end` is defined as `len(lst) - 1` and `len(lst) > 1`, `end` will be at least 1. Therefore, `start` (which is 0) will not be equal to `end` (which is at least 1), and the loop can execute.

No adjustments are needed for the variables `start` and `end` because the condition is already satisfied with the given state. Therefore, we can simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 0**
