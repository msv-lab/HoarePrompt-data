The loop condition in the provided `while` loop is `start != end`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d1[start] = s`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys
- `n` is the new input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `inc` is 1
- `m` is the number of iterations
- `s` is either 1 if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`
- If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.
- `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if the if condition is true, otherwise `mini` does not equal `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`
- `start` is `start + inc`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `start` must be different from `end`. Since `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `start` should be any value less than `end`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `start` to be less than `end`. Given that `start` is incremented by `inc` (which is 1) in each iteration, we can ensure that `start` is less than `end` by setting `start` to a value less than `end`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d1[start] = s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is either 1 if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged; `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if the if condition is true, otherwise `mini` does not equal `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; `start` is less than `end`**
