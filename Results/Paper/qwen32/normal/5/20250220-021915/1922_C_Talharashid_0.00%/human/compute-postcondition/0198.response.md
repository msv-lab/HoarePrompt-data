Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and key `start` with value `s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 2`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**
