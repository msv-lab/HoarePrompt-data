Output State: **`start` is now `start + inc`, `end` remains the same, `lst` remains the same, `mini` remains the same, `s` remains the same.**

Explanation: The only change is that the value of `start` has been incremented by `inc`. All other variables (`end`, `lst`, `mini`, `s`) retain their initial values.
