The code snippet updates the values of `start` and `end` by reading two integers from the input and subtracting 1 from each. This affects the `start` and `end` variables directly. The other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on `start` and `end` for their calculations, which they do not in this snippet.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `i + 2`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `0` with corresponding values of `s` after each iteration, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the first input integer minus 1, `end` is the second input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0. If `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**.

In simpler terms, `start` and `end` are now the first and second input integers minus 1, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
