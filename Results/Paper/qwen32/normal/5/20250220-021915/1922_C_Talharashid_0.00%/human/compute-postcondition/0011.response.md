Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is 11111111.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `mini` has been assigned the value `11111111`. All other variables retain their initial values.
