The given code snippet sets the variable `mini` to the value `11111111`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` remains 0 or is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `mini` is `11111111`.**
