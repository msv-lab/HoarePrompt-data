The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `lst`. The variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, and `n` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
