arr is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, each with its own arr and k, where the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 500, the length of arr n satisfies 1 <= n <= 100, and arr contains exactly n integers.
