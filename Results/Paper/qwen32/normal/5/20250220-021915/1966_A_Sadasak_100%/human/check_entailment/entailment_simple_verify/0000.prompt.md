You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations. Here are a few issues and edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**: The function `func_1` only keeps track of frequencies up to `k`, which is incorrect. The frequency of each card should be counted without this constraint, as the operations can be performed multiple times.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left. The logic to determine if `k` is in the frequency table and then printing `k - 1` is not correct. The correct approach involves using the frequencies of each card to determine how many cards can be reduced by performing the operations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where all cards are the same or where the number of cards is less than `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cards_left(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, k), nums in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        remaining_cards = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            # For each unique card count, determine how many cards remain after operations
            remaining_cards += count % (k - 1) if count % (k - 1) != 0 else k - 1
        
        results.append(remaining_cards)
    
    return results

t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append(((n, k), nums))

results = min_cards_left(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

In the corrected version:
- We count the frequency of each card.
- For each unique card count, we determine how many cards remain after performing the operations. The formula `count % (k - 1)` gives the remainder of cards after replacing groups of `k` cards with `k-1` cards. If the remainder is zero, we need to keep `k-1` cards to avoid having zero cards, which is not possible.
- We sum up the remaining cards for all unique card counts to get the final result.
