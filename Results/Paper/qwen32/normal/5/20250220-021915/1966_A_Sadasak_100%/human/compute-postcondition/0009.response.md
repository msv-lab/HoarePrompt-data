Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**
