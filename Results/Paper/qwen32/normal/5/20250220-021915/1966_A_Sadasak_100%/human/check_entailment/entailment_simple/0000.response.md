### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve a problem involving a series of operations on a hand of cards, where the goal is to minimize the number of cards left by repeatedly exchanging sets of `k` cards for `k-1` cards. Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integer `k`.
   - It then reads the list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, no operations can be performed, so the minimum number of cards is `n`.
   - Otherwise, the program calls `func_1` to compute a frequency table of the card numbers, capping the count of each number at `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` constructs a frequency table (`frequency_table`) where each key is a unique card number and the value is the count of that card number in the list, capped at `k`.
   - The function returns this frequency table.

4. **Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - After obtaining the frequency table, the program checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table.
   - If `k` is a value, it prints `k - 1` (indicating that a set of `k` cards can be exchanged for `k-1` cards).
   - Otherwise, it prints `n` (indicating that no such set of `k` cards exists that can be exchanged).

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations.
- The key mistake is in the logic of checking if `k` is a value in the frequency table and printing `k - 1` in that case. This does not account for the possibility of exchanging multiple sets of `k` cards or the optimal sequence of exchanges.
- The program also does not correctly handle the situation where the counts of card numbers are less than `k` but can still be combined in a way that minimizes the total number of cards.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
