To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which is `num` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one integer. The variable `num` will be assigned the first element of `arr` during the first iteration of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, `arr` is already described as a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `arr` is not empty so that the loop can execute.

The variable `k` and `frequency_table` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
