Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    if frequency_table[num] > k:
        frequency_table[num] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the count of `num` set to `k` if the count was originally greater than `k`, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element. Otherwise, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
