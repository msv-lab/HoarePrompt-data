### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- We have a hand of `n` cards, each with a number.
- We can repeatedly exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards with any number.
- The goal is to minimize the number of cards left in the hand.

**Program Analysis:**
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, and the number of cards remains `n`. This part is correctly handled.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the frequency of each card number but truncates the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because the actual frequency is needed to determine how many exchanges can be made.

4. **Logic for Determining Minimum Cards:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true. This logic is flawed because:
     - The presence of `k` in the frequency table does not directly translate to achieving `k-1` cards.
     - The program does not correctly account for the number of exchanges that can be made based on the actual frequencies.

**Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:**
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call `func_1`.
- The function `func_1` correctly builds a frequency table but truncates frequencies to `k`. This truncation is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual number of cards that can be exchanged.

**Correct Approach:**
- Calculate the actual frequency of each card number.
- For each card number with frequency `f`, compute the number of exchanges as `f // k` and the remaining cards as `f % k`.
- Sum the remaining cards for all card numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

**Conclusion:**
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed exchanges. The frequency truncation and the logic for determining the minimum cards are flawed.
