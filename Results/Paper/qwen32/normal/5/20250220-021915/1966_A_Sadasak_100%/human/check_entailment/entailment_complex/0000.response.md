Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the specified operations. However, there are some issues with the logic and implementation of the program that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number in the list `arr` but caps the frequency at `k`. While this is done correctly, the capped frequency does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

2. **Incorrect Usage of `func_1`**: The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary returned by `func_1`. This check is incorrect because the presence of `k` in the frequency values does not directly help in determining the minimum number of cards left.

3. **Incorrect Output Logic**: The logic to determine the output is flawed. The program should calculate the minimum number of cards left by considering how many full sets of `k` cards can be replaced with `k-1` cards for each unique card number.

Here is a corrected approach:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- For each card number, determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be replaced with `k-1` cards.
- The remaining cards after all possible operations will be the sum of `(frequency % k)` for each unique card number, plus 1 if there is at least one full set of `k` cards that can be replaced.

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards left.

Correctness: **False**
