The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr` to be processed, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

Given that `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be the element that comes right after the current `num`.

Let's denote the current `num` as `num_current`. The next `num` should be the element at the next index of `arr` after `num_current`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**

Since we don't have the current value of `num` or its index, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in `arr`:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**

To be more specific if we assume `num` was the `i`th element in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration `num` should be the `(i+1)`th element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**

If we denote the index of the previously processed `num` as `i`, then the next `num` should be `arr[i+1]`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, and `num` is `arr[i+1]` where `i` is the index of the previously processed element.**

Since we don't have the exact index `i`, we can just say `num` is the next element in `arr`:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**

So the final answer is:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num`'s count set to `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, otherwise `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, and `num` is the next element in `arr` after the previously processed element.**
