Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations. Here are a few issues and edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**: The function `func_1` only keeps track of frequencies up to `k`, which is incorrect. The frequency of each card should be counted without this constraint, as the operations can be performed multiple times.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left. The logic to determine if `k` is in the frequency table and then printing `k - 1` is not correct. The correct approach involves using the frequencies of each card to determine how many cards can be reduced by performing the operations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where all cards are the same or where the number of cards is less than `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cards_left(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, k), nums in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        remaining_cards = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            # For each unique card count, determine how many cards remain after operations
            remaining_cards += count % (k - 1) if count % (k - 1) != 0 else k - 1
        
        results.append(remaining_cards)
    
    return results

t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append(((n, k), nums))

results = min_cards_left(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

In the corrected version:
- We count the frequency of each card.
- For each unique card count, we determine how many cards remain after performing the operations. The formula `count % (k - 1)` gives the remainder of cards after replacing groups of `k` cards with `k-1` cards. If the remainder is zero, we need to keep `k-1` cards to avoid having zero cards, which is not possible.
- We sum up the remaining cards for all unique card counts to get the final result.
