The code snippet updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the integer `num`. Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is an integer from the list `arr`. The `get` method retrieves the current count of `num` from `frequency_table`, defaulting to 0 if `num` is not already a key in the dictionary, and then increments this count by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the count of `num` incremented by 1.**
