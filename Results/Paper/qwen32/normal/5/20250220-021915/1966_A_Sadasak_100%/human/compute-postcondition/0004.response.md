The code snippet sets the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. Given that the initial state specifies that `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, this assignment will change the value of `frequency_table[num]` to exactly `k`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `arr` is still a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `k` is still an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- The `frequency_table` dictionary still holds counts of numbers, but specifically for the key `num`, its value is now exactly `k`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the count of `num` set to `k`.**
