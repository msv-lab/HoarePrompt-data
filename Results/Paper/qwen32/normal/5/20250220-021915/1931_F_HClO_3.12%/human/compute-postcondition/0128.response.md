The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since the provided code snippet does not contain any loops, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the flow of the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input.**
