The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

The string `'no'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function. This means that regardless of the initial state or the values of any variables (such as `val`, `a_next`, and `l_next`), the output will be the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **no**
