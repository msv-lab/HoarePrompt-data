The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an input integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are described as integers obtained from the input, with `m` specifically mentioned to be 1 at the current state.
3. The `print` statement is `print('yes')`, which directly prints the string `'yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`, the output will simply be the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
