The only variables in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `val`.

At the end of the last iteration, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a_next, l_next)`, where `a_next` and `l_next` are the next elements in the list `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the program state.

For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must still contain at least one tuple. Since `(a3, l3)` was just processed, the next tuple in `val` will be assigned to `(a3, l3)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `a3` and `l3` will be the next tuple in `val`.

State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a_next, l_next)`, where `a_next` and `l_next` are the next elements in the list `val`, `a3` is the next `a_next` in `val`, `l3` is the next `l_next` in `val`**
