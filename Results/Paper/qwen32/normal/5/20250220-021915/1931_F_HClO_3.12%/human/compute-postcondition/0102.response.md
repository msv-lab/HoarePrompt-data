The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. 

Given the initial state:
- If `idx1 > idx2`, `val` is an empty list.
- If `idx1 <= idx2`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`.

After executing the code snippet, `val` will have an additional tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to it. Therefore, the new state of `val` will be:
- If `idx1 > idx2`, `val` will now be `[(a3, l3)]`.
- If `idx1 <= idx2`, `val` will now contain two tuples, the original one and the new one, so `val` will be `[(original_a3, original_l3), (a3, l3)]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is either `[(a3, l3)]` if `idx1 > idx2` or `[(original_a3, original_l3), (a3, l3)]` if `idx1 <= idx2`; `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
