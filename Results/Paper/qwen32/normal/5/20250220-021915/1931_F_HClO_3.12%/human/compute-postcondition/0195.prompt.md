Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the loop or if statement continues to execute. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop or if statement has been broken out of and the current element at `l1[idx1]` is equal to `a2` and the current element at `l2[idx2]` is equal to `a1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no change is made to the variables. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `idx1` and `idx2` are set to 2. Otherwise, `idx1` is set to 2 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx2` is set to 2 if `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `p2` is set to 1 if `l2[i + p2] == a1`, and if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is 3, `idx2` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 3 and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is 3 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
