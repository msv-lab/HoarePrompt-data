### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if there is a consistent order of participants in the chat that matches all the screenshots taken by the participants. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Single Screenshot Case**: If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program immediately outputs "YES" because a single screenshot alone cannot contradict any order.

2. **Two Screenshot Case**: If there are two screenshots, the program compares the orders (excluding the author of each screenshot). If these orders are identical after excluding the authors, it checks for a possible swap between the authors in one of the screenshots. If the orders can be made consistent by this swap, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

3. **More than Two Screenshots Case**: For more than two screenshots, the program first processes the first two screenshots to establish a possible consistent order. If the first two screenshots do not provide a consistent order, it immediately outputs "NO". If they do, it continues to check the remaining screenshots against this established order, considering possible swaps involving the authors. If any screenshot does not match the established order, it outputs "NO". If all screenshots match, it outputs "YES".

### Analysis:

- **Single Screenshot**: The program correctly handles this case by outputting "YES" since no contradiction is possible with a single screenshot.
  
- **Two Screenshots**: The program correctly checks for consistency and handles the possibility of a swap between the authors. This logic is sound and correctly handles the case where the order can be made consistent by a single swap.
  
- **More than Two Screenshots**: The program correctly extends the logic from two screenshots to more than two by establishing a consistent order from the first two screenshots and then verifying the remaining screenshots against this order. It correctly handles the possibility of swaps involving the authors.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if there is a consistent order of participants that matches all the screenshots. Given the provided reasoning and analysis, the program seems to be correct.
