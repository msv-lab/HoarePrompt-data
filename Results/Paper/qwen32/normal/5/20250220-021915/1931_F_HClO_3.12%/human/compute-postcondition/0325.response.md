Postcondition: **`t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4 (since the loop executed 3 times); `m` remains at least 5; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2` (since the loop completed `n - 1` iterations); `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`**
