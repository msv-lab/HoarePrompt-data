The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('yes')`. This statement does not depend on any variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) and mentions that an additional input is read but not assigned to any variable.
2. The `print` statement does not use any of these variables or the additional input.
3. The string `'yes'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
