The initial state provides the values of variables `t`, `n`, and `m`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('yes')`, which is a direct string output and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is set to 1.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers provided as input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement outputs the string `'yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any variables or conditions based on the input values, the output will simply be the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
