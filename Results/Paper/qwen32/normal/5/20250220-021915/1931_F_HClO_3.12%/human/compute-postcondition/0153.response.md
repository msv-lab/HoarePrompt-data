Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
