Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, with `idx1` and `idx2` set to `i`. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, or `idx2`.**
