The provided code snippet consists of a single `input()` function call, which reads input from the user but does not assign it to any variable. Therefore, this input is essentially discarded and does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input.**
