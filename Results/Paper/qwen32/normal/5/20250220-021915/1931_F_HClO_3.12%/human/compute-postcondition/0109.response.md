To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how the variables are modified. The loop runs for `m - 2` iterations, and during each iteration, it appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the `val` list, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `val` will continue to accumulate tuples `(a3, l3)` for each iteration of the loop.

Here's the final state after all iterations:

- `t` remains the same as the input integer.
- `n` and `m` remain the same as the input integers.
- `a1` and `a2` remain the same as the input integers.
- `l1` remains modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`.
- `l11` and `l22` remain the same, as they are created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively.
- `idx1` remains the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found.
- `idx2` remains set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found.
- `p1` and `p2` remain set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0.
- `val` will contain `m - 2 + 1` tuples if `idx1 > idx2` or `m - 2 + 2` tuples if `idx1 <= idx2`. This is because `val` already contains 1 or 2 tuples from the initial conditions, and each iteration adds one more tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is a list containing `m - 2 + 1` tuples if `idx1 > idx2` or `m - 2 + 2` tuples if `idx1 <= idx2`; `a3` is an integer obtained from the input; `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `val` list will have `m - 1` tuples if `idx1 > idx2` or `m` tuples if `idx1 <= idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state or as derived from the initial conditions.
