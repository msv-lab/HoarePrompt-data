t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case is a tuple (n, k, orders), where n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5, and orders is a list of k lists, where each list contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. The first element of each list in orders is the author of the screenshot, and the rest of the list represents the order of participants shown to the author in the screenshot. All authors in orders are different across all test cases.
