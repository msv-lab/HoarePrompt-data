The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to a new variable `idx1`. No other operations are performed that affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, or the condition involving `i`, `max(p1, p2)`, and `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `i`; `idx1` is the value of `i`.**
