Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer.**

In natural language, after the code execution, `t` remains the same input integer within the range of 1 to 10,000. Additionally, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the first and second integers, respectively, from the new input.
