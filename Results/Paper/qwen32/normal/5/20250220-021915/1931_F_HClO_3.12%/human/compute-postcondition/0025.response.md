The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means `n` must be at least 2.

Given the state provided, the variables `t`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` do not affect the execution of the loop as they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we only need to adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0**
