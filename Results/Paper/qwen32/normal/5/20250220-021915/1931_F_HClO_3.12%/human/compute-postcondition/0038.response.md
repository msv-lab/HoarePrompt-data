Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is `i`; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. At this point, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx2` has been updated to `i`, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
