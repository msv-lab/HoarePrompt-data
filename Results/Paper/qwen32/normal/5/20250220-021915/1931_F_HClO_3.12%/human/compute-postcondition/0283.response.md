Postcondition: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 2; `m` is at least 5; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`. Both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `i` is 0. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `m - 5` new lines of input are read but not assigned to any variable. Additionally, if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
