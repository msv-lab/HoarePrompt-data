Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 2; `m` is at least 5; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
