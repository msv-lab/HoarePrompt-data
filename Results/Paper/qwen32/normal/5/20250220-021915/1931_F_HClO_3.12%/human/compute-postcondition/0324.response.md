The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` remains at least 5; `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`; `l` is equal to `l1`.**
