Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0. The current element at `l1[idx1]` is equal to `a2` and the current element at `l2[idx2]` is equal to `a1`. `p1` is 1 and `p2` is 0, or `p1` is 0 and `p2` is 1. `i + max(p1, p2)` is not equal to `n - 1` as the loop or if statement has not been broken out of.**
