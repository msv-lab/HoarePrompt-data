The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position specified by `idx1` in the list `l2`. Given that `idx1` is -1, `a2` will be inserted at the end of the list `l2`.

Here are the changes to the variables:
- `l2` will have `a2` inserted at the end of the list.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration.
- `n` is at least 4.
- `m` remains at least 5.
- `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met.
- `idx1` is less than `idx2`.
- `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them.
- `val` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` remains at least 5; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `idx1` is less than `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is an empty list; `a2` is inserted at the end of `l2`.**
