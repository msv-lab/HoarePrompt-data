The code snippet `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are unchanged, `val` is an empty list, if `m` is 2, then `m` remains 2, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l` is equal to `l2`.**
