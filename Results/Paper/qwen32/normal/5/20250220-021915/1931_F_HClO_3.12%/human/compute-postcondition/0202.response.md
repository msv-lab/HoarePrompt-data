The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the index `idx2` in the list `l1`. Given that `idx2` is -1, the value of `a1` will be inserted at the end of the list `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**
