The provided code snippet initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, to `-1`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**
