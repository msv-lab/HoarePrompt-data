You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and n is the length of the list arr. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, with the total number of elements across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is `n - 1`.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is the first index from the end where `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or 0 if all elements are equal from the end to the beginning.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the number of elements between the first index where the element differs from its next neighbor and the first index from the end where the element differs from its previous neighbor, exclusive, or 0 if all elements are equal.
    #State: `i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is the first index from the end where `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or 0 if all elements are equal from the end to the beginning; the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements between `i` and the end of the array (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the array to `j` (exclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= n, and n is the length of the list `arr`. The function returns the number of elements between the first index where the element differs from its next neighbor and the first index from the end where the element differs from its previous neighbor, exclusive, or 0 if all elements are equal. If all elements are not equal, it returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements between `i` and the end of the array (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the array to `j` (exclusive).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number of elements between the first index where the element differs from its next neighbor and the first index from the end where the element differs from its previous neighbor, exclusive, or 0 if all elements are equal.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements between `i` and the end of the array (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the array to `j` (exclusive).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
