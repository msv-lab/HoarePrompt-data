Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `len(arr) > 1` and `arr[0] == arr[1]`; `i` is 1; `j` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `arr` remains a list of integers with more than one element where the first two elements are equal; `i` is incremented by 1, so now `i` is 1; `j` remains the same, which is `n - 1`.
