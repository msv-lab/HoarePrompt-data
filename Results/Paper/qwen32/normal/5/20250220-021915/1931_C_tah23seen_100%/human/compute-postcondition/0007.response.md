To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where `len(arr) > 2` and `arr[1] == arr[2]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. **`i < len(arr) - 1`**: Since `i` is 2, for this condition to be true, `len(arr) - 1` must be greater than 2, which means `len(arr)` must be greater than 3. Given that `len(arr) > 2`, this condition can be satisfied if `len(arr)` is adjusted to be greater than 3.
2. **`arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**: Since `i` is 2, this condition translates to `arr[2] == arr[3]`. Given that `arr[1] == arr[2]`, we need to ensure that `arr[3]` is equal to `arr[2]` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, to make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust:
- `len(arr)` to be greater than 3.
- `arr[3]` to be equal to `arr[2]`.

No other states need to be adjusted according to the loop head conditions.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `len(arr) > 3`, `arr[1] == arr[2]`, and `arr[2] == arr[3]`; `i` is 2; `j` is `n - 1`**
