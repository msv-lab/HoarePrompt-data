To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and when it terminates.

The loop increments `i` as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` and `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as there are consecutive equal elements in the list `arr` starting from the beginning.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `arr[0] == arr[1]` and `i` is 1.
- After 2 iterations, `arr[1] == arr[2]` and `i` is 2.
- After 3 iterations, `arr[2] == arr[3]` and `i` is 3.

This pattern suggests that the loop will continue to increment `i` as long as there are consecutive equal elements. The loop will terminate when either `i` reaches `len(arr) - 1` or `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the final output state will be when `i` is the position right after the last consecutive equal element from the start of the list. If all elements from the start are equal, `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`.

The variable `j` remains unchanged throughout the loop, so it will still be `n - 1`.

**Output State: i is the position right after the last consecutive equal element from the start of the list (or len(arr) - 1 if all elements are equal); j is n - 1.**

In natural language, this means that `i` will point to the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or it will be at the last index of the list if all elements are the same. The variable `j` will remain as the last index of the list.
