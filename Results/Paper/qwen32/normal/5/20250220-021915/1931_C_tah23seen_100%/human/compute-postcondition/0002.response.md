The code assigns the variable `j` the value of `len(arr) - 1`. Given that `arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, `j` will be assigned the value `n - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`.**
