To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where `len(arr) > 1` and `arr[0] == arr[1]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `n - 1` (Note: `j` is not used in the loop condition, so we can ignore it for this analysis).

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`: Since `i` is 1, this condition will be true as long as `len(arr) > 2`.
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: Since `i` is 1, this condition will be true as long as `arr[1] == arr[2]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- `len(arr) > 2` to satisfy `i < len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr[1] == arr[2]` to satisfy `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `len(arr) > 2` and `arr[1] == arr[2]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `len(arr) > 2` and `arr[1] == arr[2]`; `i` is 1; `j` is `n - 1`**.
