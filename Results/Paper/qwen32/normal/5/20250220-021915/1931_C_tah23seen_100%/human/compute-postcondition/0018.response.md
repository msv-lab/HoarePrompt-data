Postcondition: **`i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is the first index from the end where `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or 0 if all elements are equal from the end to the beginning. The elements at the start and end of the array are equal (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`).**
