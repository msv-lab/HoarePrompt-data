arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array (n) followed by n integers representing the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The first element of arr is the number of test cases (t), and for each test case, the first element is the size of the array (n) and the subsequent n elements are the array elements (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
