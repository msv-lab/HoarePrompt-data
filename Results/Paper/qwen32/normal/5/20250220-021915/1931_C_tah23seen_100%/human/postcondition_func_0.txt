The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 1 and the length of the list. It returns the number of elements between the first index where the element differs from its next neighbor and the first index from the end where the element differs from its previous neighbor, exclusive. If all elements are equal, it returns 0. If not all elements are equal, it returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements from the first differing element to the end of the list (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the list to the first differing element from the end (exclusive).
