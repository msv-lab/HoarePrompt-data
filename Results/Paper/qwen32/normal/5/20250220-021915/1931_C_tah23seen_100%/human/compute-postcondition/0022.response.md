Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= n, and n is the length of the list `arr`. The function returns the number of elements between the first index where the element differs from its next neighbor and the first index from the end where the element differs from its previous neighbor, exclusive, or 0 if all elements are equal. If all elements are not equal, it returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements between `i` and the end of the array (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the array to `j` (exclusive).**
