Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 1, `s` is the string `'c'`, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[2]` which is 1, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
