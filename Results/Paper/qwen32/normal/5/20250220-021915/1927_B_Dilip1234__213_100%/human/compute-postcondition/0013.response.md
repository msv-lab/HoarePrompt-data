Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[1]` which is 1, and `s` is 'b', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros and `s` remains an empty string.**
