The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range it iterates over (which is fixed at 26). Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` for the loop to execute one more time.

From the provided state, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. Since the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 25, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

So, `j` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is 'b', `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[0]` which is `a[2] + 1` and `char_count[1]` which is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros.**
