Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `s` is 'a', `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 1` and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
