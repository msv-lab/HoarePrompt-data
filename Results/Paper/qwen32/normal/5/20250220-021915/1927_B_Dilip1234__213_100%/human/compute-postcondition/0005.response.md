The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s` based on the value of `j`. Since `j` is initially 0, `chr(j + ord('a'))` will append the character 'a' to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `s` is 'a', `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`.**
