Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
