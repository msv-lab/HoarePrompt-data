Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `total_count` is incremented by the value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `cnt` affects `res` based on the provided condition, but since the code snippet only modifies `total_count`, we will focus on that.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `total_count` is increased by the value of `cnt`, and all other variables retain their initial values unless `cnt` triggers an update to `res` based on the given condition.
