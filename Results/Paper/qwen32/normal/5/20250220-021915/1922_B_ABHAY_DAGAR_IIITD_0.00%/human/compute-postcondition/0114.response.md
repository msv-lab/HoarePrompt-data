The code modifies the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. Given that `total_count` is 0, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` evaluates to 0, and thus `res` remains unchanged. The other variables (`cnt`, `results`, `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, and `total_count`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer; `total_count` is 0.**
