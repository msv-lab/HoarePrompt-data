The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `num_list`. The variables `test_cases`, `results`, and `n` are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
