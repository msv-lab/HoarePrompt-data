Postcondition: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input (and must contain at least one integer), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0.**
