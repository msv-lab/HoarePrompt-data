The provided code snippet only modifies the `total_count` variable by adding the value of `cnt` to it. No other variables are altered by this specific line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `total_count` while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is `next_cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is also updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms: The value of `total_count` has been increased by `cnt`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
