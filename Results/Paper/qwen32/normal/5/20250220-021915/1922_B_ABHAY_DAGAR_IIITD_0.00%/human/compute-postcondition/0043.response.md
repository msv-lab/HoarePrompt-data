To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the variables `res` and `total_count`. The loop iterates over each value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary, updating `res` and `total_count` based on the conditions specified.

Let's summarize the loop's behavior:
1. For each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`:
   - If `cnt >= 3`, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
   - If `cnt >= 2`, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
   - `total_count` is incremented by `cnt`.

The loop continues until all values in `num_of_lens` have been processed.

Given the initial state and the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to process all values in `num_of_lens`. After all iterations, the final values of `res` and `total_count` will reflect the cumulative effect of all these updates.

**Output State:**
- `test_cases` remains a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `num_list` remains the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.
- `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations.
- `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the final output state will have the `res` variable holding the total number of combinations of integers from `num_list` that meet the specified conditions (triplets and pairs), and `total_count` will be the sum of all counts of integers in `num_list`. All other variables will remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is the dictionary with counts of integers from `num_list`, `res` is the final accumulated value, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
