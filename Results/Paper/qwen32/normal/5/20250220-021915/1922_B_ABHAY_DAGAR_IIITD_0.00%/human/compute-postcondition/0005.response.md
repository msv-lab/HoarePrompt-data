The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the iteration variable for the elements in `num_list`. Therefore, the state of `num_list` is the only one that can directly influence whether the loop will execute.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `num_list` contains at least one element. The current state indicates that `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, which implies it can be empty or contain one or more integers. To ensure the loop executes, `num_list` must have at least one integer.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_of_lens`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. They remain as they are in the provided state.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary**
