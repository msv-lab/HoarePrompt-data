Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key with its count incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, or with `1` as its value if `x` was not in `num_of_lens`, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, and `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the next element in `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a count of 1. `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, and `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a count of 1. `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, and `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
