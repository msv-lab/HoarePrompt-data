Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is `2 * ((n // 2 + 1) // 2)`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the postconditions of the if part are met. Otherwise, no change occurs beyond the initial setup of variables.**
