Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\). If `s` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
