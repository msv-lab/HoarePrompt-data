Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is at least 1 and `n` is the input integer divided by 2 (integer division); `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \(n + 1\); `m` is 4; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\); and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
