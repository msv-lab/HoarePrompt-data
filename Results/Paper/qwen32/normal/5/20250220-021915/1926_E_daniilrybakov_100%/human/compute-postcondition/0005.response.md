To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. The loop condition is `while n:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\)
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer
- `s` is 0
- `m` is 1

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-zero value. Since `n` is obtained from the input and we are not given any specific value for it, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is not zero. No other variables need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is an integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1**
