Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is now \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{previous } n}{2} \right\rfloor\); `k` is an integer; `s` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\)**

In natural language: The value of `n` has been updated to the integer division of its previous value by 2. The values of `t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged except for `n`, which is now half of its previous value (rounded down).
