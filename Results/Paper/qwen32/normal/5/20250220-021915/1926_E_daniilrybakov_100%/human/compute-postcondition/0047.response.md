The code snippet `m *= 2` doubles the value of `m`. Given the initial state, `m` is initially 2, so after the operation, `m` becomes 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is a non-zero integer and `n` must be at least 1 after the current iteration's halving; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \(n + 1\); `m` is 4; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
