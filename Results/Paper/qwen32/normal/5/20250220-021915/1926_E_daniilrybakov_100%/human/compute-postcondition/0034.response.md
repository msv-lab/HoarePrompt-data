The code snippet `x = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the integer division of `n + 1` by 2 and assigns the result to `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
