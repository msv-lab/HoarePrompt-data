Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is 0; `k` is an integer; `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` values from each iteration until the loop terminates; `m` is \(2^i\) where `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is the smallest non-zero integer such that the condition `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is met; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is the sum of all `x` values up to the point where the condition is met; `m` is `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `n` is `0`.
- `m` is `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations.
- `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `t` is the initial integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\).

Putting this in the required format:

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
