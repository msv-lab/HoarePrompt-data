The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given the initial state, `cur` is set to `num`, and since `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` retains the value of `num`. The dictionary `M` was initially empty, and after the assignment, it will have one key-value pair: `cur` mapped to `1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with one entry `{cur: 1}`, `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**

In simple terms, the dictionary `M` now contains the key `cur` with the value `1`, and all other variables remain as specified in the initial state.
