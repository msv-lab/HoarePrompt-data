Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is an empty dictionary; `cur` is 0; `num` is an integer such that `num > cur`. The current value of `cur` is 0, and `num` is greater than 0, and `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `N`, `S`, `M`, `cur`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
