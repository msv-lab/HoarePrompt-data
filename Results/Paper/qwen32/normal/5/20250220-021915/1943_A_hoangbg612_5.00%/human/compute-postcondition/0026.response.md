The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If there are more integers in `N`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last integer in `N` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must have at least one more integer.

Given that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one integer, and `num` is the next integer in `N` at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `num` to the next integer in the list.

State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 integers; `num` is the next integer in `N`**
