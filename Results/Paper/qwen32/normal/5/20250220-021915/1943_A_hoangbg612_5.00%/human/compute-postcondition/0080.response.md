Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `num`, and `cur` remain as specified, except `cur` is increased by 1. The program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
