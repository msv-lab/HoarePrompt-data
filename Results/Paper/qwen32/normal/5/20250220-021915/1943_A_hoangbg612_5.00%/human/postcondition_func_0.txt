The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `S` and an array `N` of integers. It processes the array to determine the smallest integer `i` such that the count of `i` in the array is less than or equal to `i`. If no such `i` exists, it returns the next integer after the largest number in the array that satisfies the condition. The function prints this integer for each test case.
