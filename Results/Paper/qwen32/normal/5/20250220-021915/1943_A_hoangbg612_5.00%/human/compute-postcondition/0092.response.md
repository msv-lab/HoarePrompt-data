The code snippet `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `cur`. The other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, and the condition for `M[i]`) remain unchanged. 

Since `i` is the current key being processed in the dictionary `M`, the value of `cur` is now equal to `i`. The precondition that `cur` is greater than 0 is still valid because `i` is a key in `M`, which is defined to have keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N`, and the smallest number in `N` is at least 0.

Output State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is equal to `i`, and for the current key `i` in `M`, the count `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**
