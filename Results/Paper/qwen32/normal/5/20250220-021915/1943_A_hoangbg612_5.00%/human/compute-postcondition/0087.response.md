Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is the sorted list of integers, `cur` is the last number processed in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`. The sum of the values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**
