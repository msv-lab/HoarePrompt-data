### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and see if it adheres to the game rules and correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted. This is not necessary for the correct computation of MEX, but it might help with the logic of the algorithm.

3. **Tracking Elements**:
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array `a`.
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` and is used to track the current MEX value.

4. **Processing Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `a` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If a number `num` in the array is greater than the current `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means there's a gap, so `cur` is incremented to `cur + 1` and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `num` and the count of `num` in `M` is set to 1.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it means `num` is a duplicate, so the count of `num` in `M` is incremented.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals `n`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - The program then iterates from `0` to `cur` and checks if `M[i] <= i`. If such an `i` is found, `cur` is updated to `i` and the loop breaks.

6. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cur` is printed as the MEX of the array `c`.

### Analysis:

The logic in the program has several issues:

- **Sorting is Unnecessary**: Sorting the array `a` does not help in computing the MEX.
- **Incorrect Handling of Duplicates**: The logic for handling duplicates and updating `cur` is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
- **Final Adjustment Logic**: The final adjustment logic for `cur` is not clear and does not correctly reflect the game rules.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns and does not correctly compute the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. The logic for handling the game turns and updating the MEX is flawed.

**Correctness: False**

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game turns and keep track of the elements added to `c` by Alice. The MEX should be computed based on the final state of `c` after the game ends.
