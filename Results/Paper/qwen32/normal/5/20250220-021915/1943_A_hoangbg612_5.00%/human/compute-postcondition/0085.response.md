Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with `M[cur] = 1` and `cur` is set to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`, and the loop or if statement continues. If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with the value of `M[cur]` incremented by 1.**
