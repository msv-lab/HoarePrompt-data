Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 integers; `num` is the next integer in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged.**
