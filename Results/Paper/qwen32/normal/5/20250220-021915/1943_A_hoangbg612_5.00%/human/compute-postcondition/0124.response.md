Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `N`, `S`, `M`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only change is that `cur` has been incremented by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
