Postcondition: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, and `cur` is greater than 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
