The code snippet provided reassigns the variable `M` to an empty dictionary. This means that the previous dictionary `M` with keys as consecutive integers and values as their counts in the original `N` is discarded and `M` is now an empty dictionary. The other variables `N`, `S`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input; `S` is an input integer; `M` is an empty dictionary; `cur` is -1.**
