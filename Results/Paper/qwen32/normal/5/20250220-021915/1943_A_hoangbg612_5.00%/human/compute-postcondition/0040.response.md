The code snippet `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `cur`. This changes the value of `cur` from its initial state to the value of `i`. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `M[i]`) remain unchanged by this assignment.

Given the initial state and the impact of the code, the output state is:

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is equal to `i`; the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**
