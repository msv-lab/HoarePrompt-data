Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 integer; `num` is the next integer in `N`; `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, and the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values.
