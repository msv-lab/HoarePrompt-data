The code snippet `cur = -1` directly assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cur`. This change does not affect the values of `T`, `S`, or `N`. The variable `cur` is explicitly set to `-1` regardless of its previous value.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input, `cur` is -1.**
