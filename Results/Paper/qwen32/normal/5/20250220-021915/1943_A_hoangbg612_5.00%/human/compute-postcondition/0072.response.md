The code provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the nearest enclosing loop (like a `for` or `while` loop) without affecting the values of the variables directly. Therefore, the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `num`, and `cur` will remain as they are in the initial state, except that `cur` has already been increased by 1 before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
