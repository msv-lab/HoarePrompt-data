The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer `T` likely represents the number of test cases or some other parameter relevant to the subsequent code that would follow this snippet.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is affected by the code is `T`, which is assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The array a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `T` is an input integer.**
