Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The program is supposed to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting and Processing:**
   - The array `N` is sorted.
   - It then iterates through the sorted array `N` to determine the MEX.
   - It keeps track of the current MEX in the variable `cur` and uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number in `N`.

3. **Determining MEX:**
   - As it iterates through the sorted array, it checks if the current number is greater than `cur` (the current MEX).
   - If the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop, indicating that `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If the current number is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - If the current number is greater than `cur`, it sets `cur` to the current number and initializes its count in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in the dictionary `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` to find the smallest number `i` such that `M[i] <= i`. If such a number is found, it sets `cur` to `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of `c`.

**Issues in the Program:**

- The program does not correctly account for the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
- The program assumes that the MEX can be determined solely by iterating through the sorted array and counting occurrences, which does not consider the strategic moves of the players.
- The final adjustment step where it checks `M[i] <= i` is incorrect and does not reflect the optimal strategy of the game.

**Conclusion:**

The provided program does not correctly determine the final score of the game based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
