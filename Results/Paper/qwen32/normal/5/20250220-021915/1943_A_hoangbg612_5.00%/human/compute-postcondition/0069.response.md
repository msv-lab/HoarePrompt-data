Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` contains one entry `{cur: 1}`, and `cur` is updated to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `M` contains one entry `{-1: 1}` and `cur` remains -1.**
