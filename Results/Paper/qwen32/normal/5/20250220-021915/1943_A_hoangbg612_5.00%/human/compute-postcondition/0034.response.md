To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop logic and how it evolves given the initial state and the provided output states after the first few iterations.

### Loop Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `S` is an input integer (not used in the loop).
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - `M` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each `num` in `N`:
     - If `num > cur`:
       - If `num > cur + 1`, increment `cur` by 1 and break out of the loop.
       - Otherwise, set `cur` to `num` and set `M[num]` to 1.
     - If `num <= cur`, increment `M[cur]` by 1.

### Understanding the Output States
- **Iteration 1**:
  - `num` is the first element in `N`.
  - If `num > -1`, `cur` becomes `num` and `M[num]` is set to 1.
  - If `num <= -1`, `cur` remains -1 and `M[-1]` is set to 1.

- **Iteration 2**:
  - `num` is the second element in `N`.
  - If `num > cur`, `cur` becomes `num` and `M[num]` is set to 1.
  - If `num <= cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

- **Iteration 3**:
  - `num` is the third element in `N`.
  - If `num > cur`, `cur` becomes `num` and `M[num]` is set to 1.
  - If `num <= cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State
The loop will iterate over all elements in `N`. The `cur` variable will be updated to the current number if it is greater than the previous `cur` value, and the dictionary `M` will keep track of the count of each unique number encountered in `N`. If a number is encountered that is not greater than the previous `cur + 1`, the loop will continue to update `cur` and `M` accordingly.

### Conclusion
After all iterations, `cur` will be the last number in `N` that was greater than the previous `cur` value, and `M` will contain the count of each unique number in `N`.

**Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is the last number in `N` that was greater than the previous `cur` value; `M` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique number in `N`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `cur` will be the last number in the sorted list `N` that was greater than the previous number, and `M` will have the count of each unique number in `N`.
