To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information. 

The loop iterates from `0` to `cur-1`, and for each iteration `i`, it checks if `M[i]` (the count of the integer `i` in the list `N`) is less than or equal to `i`. If this condition is met, `cur` is updated to `i` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, and the loop continues until `i` reaches `cur-1`.

Given the outputs after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `cur` could be updated to `0` if `M[0] <= 0`.
- After 2 iterations, `cur` remains `0` if `M[0] <= 0`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- After 3 iterations, `cur` could be updated to `1` if `M[1] <= 1`.

The loop will terminate when `M[i] <= i` for some `i` or when `i` reaches `cur-1` without meeting the condition. The final value of `cur` will be the smallest `i` for which `M[i] <= i` is true, or it will remain as the initial `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `N` remains a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `S` remains the input integer.
- `M` remains the dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`.
- `cur` will be the smallest `i` for which `M[i] <= i` is true, or it will remain unchanged if no such `i` is found within the range of the loop.

The output state after all iterations can be described as follows:

Output State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `S` is an input integer, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, and `cur` is the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or it remains the initial `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range of the loop.**

In simpler terms, `cur` will be the smallest integer `i` where the count of `i` in `N` is less than or equal to `i`, or it will stay the same if no such integer is found within the loop range.
