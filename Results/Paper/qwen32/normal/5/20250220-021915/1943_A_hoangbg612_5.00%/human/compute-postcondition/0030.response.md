The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `num` is the next integer in the sorted list `N`, and `cur` is updated to the value of `num`, the new value of `cur` will be the next integer in `N`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 integers; `num` is the next integer in `N`; `cur` is equal to `num`.**
