Output State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is equal to `i`, and for the current key `i` in `M`, the count `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `cur`, and the condition for `M[i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
