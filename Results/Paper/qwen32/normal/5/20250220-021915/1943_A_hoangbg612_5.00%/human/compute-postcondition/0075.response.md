The given Python code assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. No other variables are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with the entry `cur: 1`, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` or the flow does not break.**
