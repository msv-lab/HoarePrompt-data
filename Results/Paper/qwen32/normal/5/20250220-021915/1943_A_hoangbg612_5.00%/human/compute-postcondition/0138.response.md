To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step-by-step based on the given conditions and the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `N`: Sorted list of integers.
- `S`: An input integer (not used in the loop).
- `M`: An empty dictionary.
- `cur`: -1 (initially).

### Loop Behavior:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - If `num` (first element in `N`) > `cur` (-1), set `cur` to `num` and `M[cur] = 1`.
   - If `num` > `cur + 1` (which is not possible initially as `cur` is -1), the loop would break, but this condition is not met here.

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - If `num` > `cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to `1` if not already set, and `cur` is updated to `num`.
   - If `num` <= `cur`, then `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.
   - If `num` > `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by `1` and the loop breaks, but this condition is not met in our loop logic as per the given states.

### Output State Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each integer in the sorted list `N`.
- For each `num` in `N`, if `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[num]` is set to `1` (or incremented if already exists).
- If `num` <= `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, `cur` will be the last element of `N`.
- `M` will have keys representing the unique integers from `N` and values representing their counts.

### Conclusion:
The final `cur` will be the last element of `N`, and `M` will be a dictionary with the counts of each unique integer in `N`.

### Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`cur` is the last element of `N`; `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `N` and values as their counts.**
