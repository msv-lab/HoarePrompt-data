The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur` was -1, so after the increment, `cur` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **T is greater than 0; S is an input integer; N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; cur is 0; M is an empty dictionary; num is greater than cur; the current value of cur is 0 and num is greater than 0; num is greater than cur + 1 (which is 1).**
