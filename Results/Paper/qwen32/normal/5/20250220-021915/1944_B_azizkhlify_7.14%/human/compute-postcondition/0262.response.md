The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `re`, or `res`. It only terminates the loop or block of code it is placed in. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is greater than `1`, `l[a[0] - 1]` is `1`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, then `re` is increased by `1` and `res` contains `a[1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `re` or `res`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
