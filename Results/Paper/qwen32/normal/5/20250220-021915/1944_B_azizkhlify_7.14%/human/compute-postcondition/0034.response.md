Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `re` is 0; `ul` is either 2 or 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 0. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
