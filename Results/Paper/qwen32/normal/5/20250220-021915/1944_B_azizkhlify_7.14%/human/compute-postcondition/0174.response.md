The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is used to iterate over the elements of the list `res`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how the loop progresses.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `res` is a non-empty list, and `i` has taken on the value of the last element that was processed in the loop body.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `res` that `i` has not yet taken on. Since `i` takes on the value of each element in `res` one by one, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list after the one it just processed.

However, we don't have information about the specific elements in the list or the current position of `i` in the list. We only know that `res` is non-empty and that the loop has just finished processing one element.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `res`.

State: **`res` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in `res`**
