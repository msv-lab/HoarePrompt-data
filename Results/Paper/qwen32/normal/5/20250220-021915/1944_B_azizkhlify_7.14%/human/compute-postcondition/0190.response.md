Given the initial state, let's break down the print statement step by step:

- `i` is defined as `res[-1] + 1`. This means `i` is one more than the last element of the list `res`.
- `res` is a list, and its last element (`res[-1]`) is used to determine the value of `i`.
- `a` is an array or list, and `a[i]` refers to the element at the index `i` in this array or list.
- `ul` and `ur` are mentioned but their values do not affect the print statement directly.
- `k` and other variables are mentioned as unchanged, and `n` is at least 0.

The print statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
This statement prints the element at index `i` of the array or list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Since the exact values of `res`, `a`, and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables given.

The value of `i` is `res[-1] + 1`, so `a[i]` refers to the element at that specific index in the list `a`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where i is res[-1] + 1 and a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
