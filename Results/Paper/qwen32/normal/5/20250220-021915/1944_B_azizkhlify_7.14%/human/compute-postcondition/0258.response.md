To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `i` is `1`.
- `n` is greater than `1`.
- `l[a[0] - 1]` is `1`.

From the information given, we know the value of `i` is explicitly `1`. However, we do not have explicit values for `a`, `l`, or `n` other than the conditions provided. The `print` statement specifically references `a[i]`, which means we need to know the value of `a[1]` to determine the output.

However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `a[1]`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `a[1]`.

The `print` statement will output the value of `a[1]` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list a)**
