Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`).
- If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to 2, then `ul` is set to 2 and `ur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `k` is not zero if `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
- `re` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- Additionally, if `ul` equals `k * 2`, then `ul` equals `k * 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` and `ur` beyond their initial conditions.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- The print statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

### Output:
Since `i` is 0, the print statement will output the first element of the list `a` twice.

Output: **a[0] a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a`)**
