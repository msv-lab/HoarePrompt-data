To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and what variables are involved.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `res`. Each iteration prints the current element `i` from `res`. The loop will continue until all elements in `res` have been printed.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `res` has at least 3 elements. The loop will continue to execute until all elements in `res` are printed. Therefore, the final state will be when the loop has iterated over every element in `res`.

### Final Output State:
- `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, `re` (if `k` is not zero) will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- `res` will be exhausted, meaning all its elements have been printed.
- The loop will terminate after printing all elements of `res`.

### Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; n is an integer greater than 0; k is 2 * k - ul; a is a list of integers obtained from the input; l is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the list a; r is a list of n integers where each element at index j is the count of occurrences of j + 1 in the sublist a[n:2 * n]; ul is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list a, multiplied by 2; ur is 0; i is undefined (as the loop has ended); res is an empty list; If k is not zero, re is the count of elements in a that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to re and res.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop, the list `res` will be empty because all its elements have been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `re` (if `k` is not zero) will retain their initial values as they are not modified by the loop. The variable `i` is undefined after the loop ends because the loop variable `i` is no longer in scope.
