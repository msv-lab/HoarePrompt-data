Let's break down the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `res` is a non-empty list.
- `i` is the next element in `res`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The list `res` is non-empty, which means it contains at least one element.
- The variable `i` is defined as the "next element in `res`". However, the term "next element" is ambiguous without additional context (like an index or an iterator). Since no specific index or method to determine `i` is given, we will assume that `i` is the first element of `res` for the sake of this explanation.

### Output:
Given the assumptions:
- `i` is the first element of the list `res`.

Thus, the `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `res` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **[first element of res] ** (where the first element of res is the first item in the list `res`)
