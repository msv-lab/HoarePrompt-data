The code snippet `res.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `res`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `re` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `re` is incremented by 1; `res` contains the element `a[i]` appended to it.**
