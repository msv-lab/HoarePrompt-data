Postcondition: **`i` is `1`, `n` is greater than `1`, `l[a[0] - 1]` is `1`. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, `re` is increased by `1` and `res` contains `a[1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `re` or `res`.**
