To determine the output of the `print` statement in the given task, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0.
3. **`k`**: Defined as \(2 \times k - ul\). This seems to be a recursive or iterative definition, but since it's not fully clear from the given information, we'll assume it's calculated based on some context not provided here.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
5. **`l`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
6. **`r`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
7. **`ul`**: The total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
8. **`ur`**: Set to 0.
9. **`i`**: The next element of `res`.
10. **`res`**: A list with at least one element.
11. **`re`**: The count of elements in `a` that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration, if `k` is not zero. Otherwise, no changes are made to `re` and `res`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- `i` is described as "the next element of `res`". This implies that `i` is an element from the list `res`.

### Output:
Since the exact elements of `res` are not specified in the initial state, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print` statement will output the next element of the list `res`.

Output: **i (where i is the next element of the list `res`)**
