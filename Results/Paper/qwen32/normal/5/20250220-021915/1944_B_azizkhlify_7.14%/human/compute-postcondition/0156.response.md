Let's analyze the provided initial state and the given Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is not mentioned or defined in the initial state. Therefore, we do not have any information about the type or contents of `a`.
- `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1, but we do not know its initial value or the value of `a` at index `i`.
- The `print` statement is set to print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Since the list `a` and the initial value of `i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **a[i] (where a is a list and i is the current index after being incremented by 1)**
