Let's break down the given information and determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `2`
- `n` is greater than `2`
- `l[a[0] - 1]` is `1`
- There are conditions related to `re` and `k` that could break the loop or if statement, but they are not directly relevant to the `print` statement we are analyzing.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is checked, and if it is `1`, `re` is increased by `1` and `res` contains `a[1]`.
- No changes are made to `re` or `res` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not `1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the element at index `i` of the list `a`, followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is `2`.
- Therefore, `a[i]` translates to `a[2]`.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `a[2]` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot provide a numerical value. However, we can describe what will be printed based on the given information.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list a)**
