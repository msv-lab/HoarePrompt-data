To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the specific conditions provided.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

From the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is initialized to `2 * n - 1`.
- The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to 2.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`. This means `i` points to the last element of the first half of the list `a` if `a` were split into two halves.

2. **Determine the value of `a[i]`**:
   - We know that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list where each element at index `j` represents the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
   - Therefore, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it means the number `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`.

3. **What will be printed**:
   - The `print` statement will print `a[i]` twice, separated by a space.

Since `a[i]` appears twice in the list `a`, and we don't have the exact value of `a[i]` from the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the value of the element at index i in the list a)**
