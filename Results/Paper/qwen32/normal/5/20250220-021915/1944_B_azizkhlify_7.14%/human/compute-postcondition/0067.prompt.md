Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `re` is 0; `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2; `ur` is 0; `i` is 0; if `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` is equal to `k`, `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if the element at index `i` in `a` appears exactly once in the list `a` (i.e., `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`), otherwise `res` is an empty list. If `re` does not equal `k`, the program does nothing and continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2; `ur` is 0; `i` is 1; if `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `res` is an empty list. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2; `ur` is 0; `i` is 2; `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`; if `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `res` is a list containing `a[2]` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `res` remains an empty list. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
