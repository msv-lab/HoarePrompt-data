The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Their Values**:
   - `t`: An integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`: New integers obtained from the input.
   - `i`: An integer with a value of 5.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('NONE')`, which directly outputs the string `'NONE'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`), their values do not affect the output.

**Output**: **NONE**
