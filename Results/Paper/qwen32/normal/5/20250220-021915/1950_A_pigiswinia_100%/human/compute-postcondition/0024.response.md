The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the following:
   - `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `i` is set to 5.

2. The `print` statement is:
   ```python
   print('NONE')
   ```

3. The string `'NONE'` is explicitly provided within the `print` statement and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
