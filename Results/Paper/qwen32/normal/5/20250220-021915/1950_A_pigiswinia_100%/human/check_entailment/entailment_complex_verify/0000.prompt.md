You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the t test cases consists of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; the loop has executed `t` times; for each of the `t` iterations, the program has read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the code:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are correctly implemented to check for the "STAIR" and "PEAK" patterns respectively. The `else` clause handles all other cases, including when the digits are equal or do not form either pattern, by printing "NONE".

The program handles all edge cases, such as when `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, or when they form neither a "STAIR" nor a "PEAK". For example:
- For input `0 0 0`, the output is "NONE".
- For input `1 5 3`, the output is "PEAK".
- For input `3 4 1`, the output is "PEAK".
- For input `4 1 7`, the output is "NONE".

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.
