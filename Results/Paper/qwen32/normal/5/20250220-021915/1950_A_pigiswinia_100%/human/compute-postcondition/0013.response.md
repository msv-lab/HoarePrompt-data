The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t`, `i`, and the conditions on `a`, `b`, and `c` are not altered by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input; `i` is 4.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers obtained from the input. The condition on whether `a < b < c` or `b` is greater than both `a` and `c` is now based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `i` remains 4.
