Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".
4. This matches exactly with the problem's requirements for determining the nature of the sequence of three digits.

Since the program correctly handles the input and output requirements as per the problem statement, and there are no logical errors or edge cases that aren't covered, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
