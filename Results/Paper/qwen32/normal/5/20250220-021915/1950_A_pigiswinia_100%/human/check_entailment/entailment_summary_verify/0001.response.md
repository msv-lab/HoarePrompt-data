Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and the function summary. Here's a systematic evaluation based on the given information:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly done using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates `t` times using a `for` loop. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a "STAIR" by verifying the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - The program checks if the digits form a "PEAK" by verifying the condition `a < b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE".

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions mentioned above.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
