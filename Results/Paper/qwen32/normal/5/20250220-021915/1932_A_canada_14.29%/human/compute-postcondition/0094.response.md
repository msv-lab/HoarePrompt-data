The provided code snippet is a simple comparison operation `thorn == 0` which checks if `thorn` is equal to 0. However, it does not assign the result of this comparison to any variable, nor does it modify any of the existing variables. Therefore, the state of all variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, and the current character `i` is not '@' and `i` is not '*'**.
