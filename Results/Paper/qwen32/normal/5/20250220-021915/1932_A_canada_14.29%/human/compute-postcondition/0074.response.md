Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is incremented by 1 if `i` is `'*'`. If `thorn` was equal to 2 before the increment, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `i` is not `'*'`, `thorn` is set to 0.**
