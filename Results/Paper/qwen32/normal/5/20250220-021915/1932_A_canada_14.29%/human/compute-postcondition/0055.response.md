The provided code snippet is `thorn == 0`. This is a comparison operation and does not actually assign any value to `thorn`. Therefore, the value of `thorn` remains unchanged. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0; the current character `i` is not equal to '@' and `i` is not equal to '*'**.
