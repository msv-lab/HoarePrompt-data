The provided code snippet is a `break` statement. This statement will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is contained within, but it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, or `i`. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, and the current character `i` is '*'.**
