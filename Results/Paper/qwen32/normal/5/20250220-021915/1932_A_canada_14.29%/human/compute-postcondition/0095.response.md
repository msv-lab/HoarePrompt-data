Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, and the current character `i` is not '@'. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is 2 if it was 2 initially, otherwise `thorn` remains 1. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains 0.**
