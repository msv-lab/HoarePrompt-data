The code snippet provided increments the value of `ret` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `thorn`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`; `ret` is incremented by 1.**
