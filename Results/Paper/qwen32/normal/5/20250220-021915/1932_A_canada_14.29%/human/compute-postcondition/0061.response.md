Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. If `thorn` was 0, it becomes 1; if it was 1, it becomes 2; and if it was 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
