Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3, `i` is the next character in the list `s` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `len`, `s`, `thorn`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code execution results in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
