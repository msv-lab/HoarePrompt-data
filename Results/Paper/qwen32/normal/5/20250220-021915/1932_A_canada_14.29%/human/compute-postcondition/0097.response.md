The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next character in the list `s`. The variables `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current character being processed. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`.

Let's break it down:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current character.
2. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`.

Since we do not know the exact position of `i` in the list `s` from the given state, we can denote the next character as `s[current_index + 1]`, where `current_index` is the index of `i` in `s` during the previous iteration.

However, since we are only adjusting the state of `i` and not the index, we can simply say that `i` is now the next character in the list `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s`**
