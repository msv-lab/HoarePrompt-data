Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is 0; if the next character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 2; otherwise, `ret` is 1. If `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not equal to '*', then `thorn` remains 0.**

Explanation: The value of `ret` is incremented by 1. If `ret` was originally 1 (when `i` is '@'), it becomes 2. If `ret` was originally 0 (when `i` is not '@'), it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
