The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current character being processed in the list `s`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list.

2. **`s`**: The list `s` remains unchanged throughout the iterations.

3. **`thorn`**: The value of `thorn` is determined by the current character `i` in the previous iteration. However, since `thorn` is recalculated in each iteration based on the current character `i`, its value at the start of the next iteration will depend on the new `i`.

4. **`ret`**: The value of `ret` is also determined by the current character `i` in the previous iteration. Since `ret` is recalculated in each iteration based on the current character `i`, its value at the start of the next iteration will depend on the new `i`.

5. **`t`** and **`len`**: These variables are not part of the loop head and are not modified within the loop based on the provided information, so they remain unchanged.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
- `s` remains the same.
- `thorn` and `ret` will be recalculated based on the new `i`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i` from the previous iteration or the exact content of `s`, we can only describe the state in a general way:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the next character in `s`; if the next character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1; otherwise, `ret` is 0. If `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not equal to '*', then `thorn` remains 0.**
