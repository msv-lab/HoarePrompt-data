The provided code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison, not an assignment. It checks if the variable `thorn` is equal to 0, but it does not change the value of `thorn` or any other variable. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the previous `i`, `thorn` is unchanged.**
