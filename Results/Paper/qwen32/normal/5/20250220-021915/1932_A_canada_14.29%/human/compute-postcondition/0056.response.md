Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is either 0 or 1 or 2; if `thorn` is 2, the current character `i` is equal to '*' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `thorn` is 1, the current character `i` is equal to '*' and the program does not break out of the loop or if statement. If `thorn` is 0, the current character `i` is not equal to '@' and `i` is not equal to '*'.**
