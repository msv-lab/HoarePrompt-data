Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is not '@', `thorn` is updated based on the next character in `s`. Specifically, if `i` is '*', `thorn` can be 1, 2, or 3, and if `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `thorn` remains either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the next character in `s`.**
