The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. Given that `a` was previously defined as a list of `n` integers, the new value of `a` will be the list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
