Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `n`, `f`, `k`, `t`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged, `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. If the current `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 1 plus its previous value. Otherwise, `greater_count` remains unchanged, `value` is the next element in the list `a`.**
