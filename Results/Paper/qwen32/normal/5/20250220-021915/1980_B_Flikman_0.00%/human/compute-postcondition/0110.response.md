Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least `len(a)` elements. `n`, `f`, `k`, `t`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged. `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k` and `greater_count` is less than `k`.**
