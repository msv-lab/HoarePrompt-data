Postcondition: **`greater_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, and `same_value_count` remain unchanged. Additionally, `greater_count` is less than `k`. The current value of `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`.**
