Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 2. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0.**
