Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    same_value_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value == favorite_value:
            same_value_count += 1
    greater_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value > favorite_value:
            greater_count += 1
    if greater_count >= k:
        print('YES')
    elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`, and `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds as per the if part. Otherwise, `greater_count` is less than `k`. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds as per the if part. Otherwise, `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `greater_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, and `same_value_count` remain unchanged. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds accordingly. If `greater_count` is less than `k`, the program checks if `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds accordingly without further changes to `greater_count`. Otherwise, `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least `len(a)` elements. `n`, `f`, `k`, `t`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged. `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` remains greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `greater_count` is less than `k`. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k` and `greater_count` is less than `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
