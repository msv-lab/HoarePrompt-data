Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>'. It determines for each test case whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string starting from the beginning of the first string by following the '>' characters, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the result for each test case.**
