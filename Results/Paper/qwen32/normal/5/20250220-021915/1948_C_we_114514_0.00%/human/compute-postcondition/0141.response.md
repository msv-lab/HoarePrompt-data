The code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` regardless of its previous value. This change impacts the variable `reachable_second_row` but does not affect the other variables listed in the initial state. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES' if `reachable_first_row` was True and certain conditions were met, otherwise `results` remains unchanged.**
