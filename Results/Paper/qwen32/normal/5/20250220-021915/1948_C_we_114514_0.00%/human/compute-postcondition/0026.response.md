The code snippet provided does not change the value of `reachable_second_row` since it is already `True`. Therefore, no changes occur to any of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value (either `True` or `False`). `j` is 4.**
