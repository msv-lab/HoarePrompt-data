To ensure that the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `test_case` and `test_cases`. The loop iterates over `test_cases`, so the state of `test_cases` is the key factor here.

### Analysis:
1. **`test_cases`**: This is a list of tuples. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. Each tuple is expected to contain an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
2. **`test_case`**: This variable represents each element in `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop iterates over `test_cases`, `test_case` does not need to be adjusted in the initial state; it will be assigned the first element of `test_cases` during the first iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable does not affect the loop execution directly, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. For simplicity, we can assume it contains exactly one tuple, which meets the minimum requirement for the loop to execute.
- `results` is an empty list. This variable does not affect the loop execution directly, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Example of Adjusted State:
- `test_cases` should be a list with at least one tuple. Let's assume it contains one tuple for simplicity: `(n, string1, string2)`, where `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \* 10^5, and `string1` and `string2` are strings of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
- `t` can remain as any integer within the given range, but for simplicity, let's assume `t` is 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, e.g., `[(4, "<<>>", ">><<")]`, `results` is an empty list**
