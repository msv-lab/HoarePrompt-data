Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, and `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_first_row` is True and `row2[j]` is equal to `'>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False. The conditions regarding `row1[j]` and `j` are preserved as specified in the precondition.**
