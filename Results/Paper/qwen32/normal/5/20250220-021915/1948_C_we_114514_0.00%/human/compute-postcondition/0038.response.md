The provided code snippet only contains the assignment `reachable_second_row = True`. This assignment does not change the value of `reachable_second_row` since it is already set to `True` in the initial state.

Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged except for the confirmation that `reachable_second_row` is indeed `True`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value unless `row1[j]` is not `'>'` and `j` is not less than `n - 1` or `row2[j]` is not `'>'`, in which case `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. Since `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is updated based on the conditions involving `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`. If `row2[j]` is `'>'`, no further change is made to `reachable_first_row`. `j` is 4.**
