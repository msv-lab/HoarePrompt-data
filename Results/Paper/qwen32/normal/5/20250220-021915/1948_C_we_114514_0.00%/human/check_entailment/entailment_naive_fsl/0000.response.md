Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the robot's ability to move up and down between the two rows, and it does not correctly handle the sequence of moves (first a free move, then a move along the arrow).

Let's analyze the logic in detail:

1. The program initializes `reachable_first_row` as `True` and `reachable_second_row` as `False`. This is correct for the starting position (1, 1).
2. The loop iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
3. For each column, if the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
   - If the arrow in the first row points right (`row1[j] == '>'`), it checks if it has reached the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the arrow in the first row points left (`row1[j] == '<'`), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` and checks if it can move to the second row and the arrow in the second row points right (`row2[j] == '>'`). If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
4. For each column, if the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
   - If the arrow in the second row points right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it checks if it has reached the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the arrow in the second row points left (`row2[j] == '<'`), it does not handle the possibility of moving to the first row and following the arrow there.

The issue arises because the program does not consider the possibility of moving between rows and following the arrows in both rows correctly. Specifically, the robot can move up or down at any point, not just when it reaches the leftmost or rightmost column.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6
><><><
><><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
The robot can follow this path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).

However, the provided program will output `NO` for this input because it does not correctly handle the alternating pattern of arrows and the ability to move between rows.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
