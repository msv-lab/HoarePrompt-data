Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<", `reachable_first_row` is `True` if `row1[j]` is `'<'`, otherwise `reachable_first_row` is `False`. If `row1[j]` is `'>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If `row1[j]` is `'>'` and `j` is less than `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` retains its initial value of `False`. If `row1[j]` is `'<'` and `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is `'>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its initial value of `False`.**
