Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` must have at least one element; `count_a` is a dictionary with the key `num` and its value is 1; `num` is a key in `count_a` with a value of 1.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the dictionary `count_a` now contains the key `num` with a value of 1. The variable `num` is now a key in `count_a`.
