To determine the final state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the effect it has on the variables.

The loop iterates over each integer `num` from 1 to `n`. For each `num`:
- If `num` is in the dictionary `count_a` and its count is 2, `max_score` is incremented by 1.

Since `n` is the length of the list `a` and the loop iterates from 1 to `n`, the loop will execute exactly `n` times.

The output state after the first 3 iterations suggests that `max_score` is incremented by 1 each time `count_a[num]` is 2 for `num` in the range 1 to 3. Thus, after `n` iterations, `max_score` will be incremented every time `count_a[num]` is 2 for `num` in the range 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the final value of `max_score` will be the total number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. `max_score` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`. `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**

In simple terms, `max_score` will be the count of numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` after the loop completes all iterations.
