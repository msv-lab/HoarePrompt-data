Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` only counts the number of pairs in the player's hand, but it does not consider the strategy of the opponent (Nene) who always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The player has cards `1, 2, 3`.
- Nene has cards `1, 2, 3`.
- The game proceeds as follows:
  1. The player plays card `1`. No points are awarded.
  2. Nene plays card `1`. No points are awarded.
  3. The player plays card `2`. No points are awarded.
  4. Nene plays card `2`. No points are awarded.
  5. The player plays card `3`. No points are awarded.
  6. Nene plays card `3`. No points are awarded.
- The player scores 0 points.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
0
```

While this specific input-output pair seems correct, the program does not account for the optimal strategy of Nene in more complex scenarios. For example, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The player has cards `1, 1, 2, 3`.
- Nene has cards `2, 3, 4, 4`.
- The game proceeds as follows:
  1. The player plays card `1`. No points are awarded.
  2. Nene plays card `4`. No points are awarded.
  3. The player plays card `1`. One point is awarded.
  4. Nene plays card `4`. One point is awarded.
  5. The player plays card `2`. No points are awarded.
  6. Nene plays card `2`. One point is awarded.
  7. The player plays card `3`. No points are awarded.
  8. Nene plays card `3`. One point is awarded.
- The player scores 1 point.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```

The program incorrectly counts the pairs in the player's hand without considering Nene's optimal strategy, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game according to the rules and does not account for the opponent's optimal strategy.
