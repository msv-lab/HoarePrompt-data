The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` modifies the dictionary `d` by adding a new key `i + 1` with a value that is the value of `d[i]` plus 1.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1` where the value of key `0` is `0` and the value of key `1` is `1` if the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', and the value of key `1` is `-1` if the character at index `i` in `s` is ')'.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet will add a new key `i + 1` (which is `2`) to the dictionary `d`. The value for this new key will be `d[i] + 1`, which is `d[1] + 1`.

Since `d[1]` is either `1` (if `s[0]` is '(') or `-1` (if `s[0]` is ')'), the value of `d[2]` will be either `2` or `0`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0`, `1`, and `2` where `d[0]` is `0`, `d[1]` is `1` if `s[0]` is '(' or `-1` if `s[0]` is ')', and `d[2]` is `2` if `s[0]` is '(' or `0` if `s[0]` is ')`, `i` is 1.**
