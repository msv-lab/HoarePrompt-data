Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0`, `1`, and `3`. If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[0]` is `1` and `d[1]` is `1`. If `s[1]` is ')', then `d[0]` is `-1` and `d[1]` is `0`. If `s[i]` is '(', then `d[3]` is `d[2] + 1`. If `s[i]` is ')', then `d[3]` is `d[2] - 1`. `i` is 2.**
