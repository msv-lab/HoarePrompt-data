Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of the combination formula `n * (n - 1) // 2` under the modulus `M`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged.
