### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of friend pairs.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - `m` lines of input, each with `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing a friend pair and their initial friendship value.

2. **Objective:**
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to compute the expected value but seems to have several logical errors. Let's break down the code and the annotations to understand why the original assessment might be correct.

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # c is the modular inverse of the total number of pairs
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f  # Sum of initial friendship values
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a  # This line seems incorrect
        print(s % M)
```

#### Annotations:
- The annotations state that the final output state after all iterations is the sum of `s` values for each of the `t` test cases, where each `s` is calculated as `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k` modulo `M`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is correct.
   - However, the subsequent summation logic is flawed. The code incorrectly accumulates the sum `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` in each iteration of the `k` loop.

2. **Incorrect Iteration and Summation:**
   - The summation logic does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in their friendship value over `k` excursions.
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` should reflect the expected increase in friendship values, but the current implementation does not correctly account for this.

3. **Ignoring the Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The code correctly sums the initial friendship values (`a`), but it does not correctly account for the expected increases in these values over the `k` excursions.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs:**
   - The code does not handle the case where there are no friend pairs correctly. While it outputs `0` for the first test case, this is coincidental and does not reflect the correct logic.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Probability of Selecting a Friend Pair:**
  - `p_friend = m / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
  - For each friend pair, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
- **Summing Initial Values and Expected Increases:**
  - Sum the initial friendship values and add the expected increases.
- **Final Expected Value:**
  - Convert the final expected value to the required modular form.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem description, and therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
