The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The value of `k` does not need to be adjusted as it is the loop's upper bound.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is 1**
