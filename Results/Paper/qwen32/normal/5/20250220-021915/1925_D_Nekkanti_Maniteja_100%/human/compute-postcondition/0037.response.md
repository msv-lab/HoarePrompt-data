The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The initial state indicates that `u`, `v`, and `f` are new integers from the input, so after this operation, their values will be updated to the integers provided in the input.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is the third integer from the input, `M` is 10, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo 10, `a` is `2 * f`, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the three new integers from the input.**
