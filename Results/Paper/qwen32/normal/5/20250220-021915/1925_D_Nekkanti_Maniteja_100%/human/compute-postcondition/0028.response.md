Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `M` is 10, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo 10.**

In natural language: The variable `s` is reset to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c`) retain their previous values.
