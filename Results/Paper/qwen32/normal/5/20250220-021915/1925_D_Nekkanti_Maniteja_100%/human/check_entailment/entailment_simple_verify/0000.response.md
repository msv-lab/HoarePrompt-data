Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment in detail.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, and the final output should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis

Here's the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Annotations and State Analysis

The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations. Specifically, the state after the final loop is described as:

```python
#State: The final output state after all iterations is the sum of `s` values for each of the `t` test cases, where each `s` is calculated as `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k` modulo `M`.
```

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is correct for probability calculations.
   - However, the summation logic inside the loop for `k` is incorrect. The current logic does not properly account for the expected increase in friendship values over the `k` excursions.

2. **Incorrect Iteration and Summation**:
   - The line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` incorrectly calculates the expected value. The expected value should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in their friendship value over `k` excursions.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends over `k` excursions can be calculated using the formula for the expected value of a binomial distribution, but the current implementation does not reflect this correctly.

3. **Ignoring the Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The code correctly sums the initial friendship values, but it does not correctly account for the expected increases in these values over the `k` excursions.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code outputs `0` for the first test case, which is coincidental and does not reflect the correct logic.

### Correct Approach

To correctly calculate the expected value, we need:

- Calculate the probability of selecting a friend pair: `p_friend = m / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
- Calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each friend pair over `k` excursions.
- Sum the initial friendship values and add the expected increases.
- Calculate the final expected value and convert it to the required modular form.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
