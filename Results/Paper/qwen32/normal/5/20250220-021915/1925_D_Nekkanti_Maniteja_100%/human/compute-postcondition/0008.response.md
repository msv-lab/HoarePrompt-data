The code snippet `a += f` increments the value of `a` by the value of `f`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a + f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input.**
