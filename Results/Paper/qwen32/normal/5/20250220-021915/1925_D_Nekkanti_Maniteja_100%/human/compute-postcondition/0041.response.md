Output State: **`s` is `0 + c * (m - 1) * c * m + c * a`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 10, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo 10, `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input, `i` is `m - 1`**

In simpler terms, the value of `s` has been updated to `0 + c * (m - 1) * c * m + c * a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
