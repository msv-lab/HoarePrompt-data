The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state of these variables does not matter because they are being reassigned. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 5, `k` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a + f + f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input, `i` is 5**.
