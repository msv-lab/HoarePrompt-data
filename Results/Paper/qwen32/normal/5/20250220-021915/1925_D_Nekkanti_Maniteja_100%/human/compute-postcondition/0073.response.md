Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `n` is the number of nodes, `m` is the number of edges, and `k` is an additional integer parameter. It also accepts `m` lines of three integers each, representing edges between nodes and a weight. The function returns a value or values based on the input for each test case, but the specific output details are not provided in the constraints.**
