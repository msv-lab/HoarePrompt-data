The code snippet simply assigns a new value to the variable `M`. This new value does not depend on any of the other variables (`s`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`). Therefore, only `M` is affected, and its new value is `10 ** 9 + 7`.

Output State: **`s` is `(c * a * k + (c * c * m * k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `M` is `10 ** 9 + 7`.**
