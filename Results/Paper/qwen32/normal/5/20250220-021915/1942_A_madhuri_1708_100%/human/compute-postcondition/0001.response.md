The code snippet provided splits a string `s` into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `s`, we can only infer that `s` must be a string containing two space-separated integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and there are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the string `s`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are now integers obtained from processing the string `s`.
