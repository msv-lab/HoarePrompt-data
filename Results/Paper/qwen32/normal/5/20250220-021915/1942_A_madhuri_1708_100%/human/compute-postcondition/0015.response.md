Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and there are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case; `s` is the next line in the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the string `s`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`. Otherwise, `k` is less than 2. The program does not alter the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, or `k` based on the if-else condition.**
