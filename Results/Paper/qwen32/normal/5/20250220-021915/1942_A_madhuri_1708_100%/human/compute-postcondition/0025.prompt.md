Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k >= 2:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            print('-1')
    else:
        print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and there are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the string `s`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`. Otherwise, `k` is less than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and there are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case; `s` is the next line in the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the string `s`. The program does not alter the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, or `k` based on the if-else condition. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`. Otherwise, `k` is less than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and there are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case; `s` is the next line in the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the new string `s`. Regardless of the value of `k`, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
