### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. The provided program's logic needs to be evaluated against the problem requirements.

1. **When k = 1**:
   - The program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has only one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself), which satisfies the condition for `k = 1`.

2. **When k ≥ 2 and n = k**:
   - The program outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`. For example, if `n = k = 3`, the output is `[3, 3, 3]`. All cyclic shifts of this array are the same and thus sorted, which satisfies the condition for `k = n`.

3. **When k ≥ 2 and n ≠ k**:
   - The program outputs `-1`. This is correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `n > k`, there will be more than `k` sorted cyclic shifts if the array is constructed in such a way that more than `k` shifts are sorted. If `n < k`, it's logically impossible to have `k` sorted shifts since there are only `n` shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as per the problem statement and execution summary.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
