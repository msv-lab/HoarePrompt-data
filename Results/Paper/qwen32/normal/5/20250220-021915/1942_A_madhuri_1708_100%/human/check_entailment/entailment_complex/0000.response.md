### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements.

1. **When k = 1:**
   - The program outputs the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For k = 1, only one cyclic shift should be sorted. The sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]` is sorted, and its cyclic shifts are not sorted unless n = 1 (which is a special case not covered here). Therefore, this satisfies the condition when k = 1.

2. **When k ≥ 2:**
   - If `n == k`, the program outputs `[k, k, ..., k]` (k times).
   - For this case, all cyclic shifts of the array `[k, k, ..., k]` are sorted because all elements are the same. Therefore, there are exactly `n` (which equals `k` in this case) sorted cyclic shifts, satisfying the condition.
   - If `n != k`, the program outputs `-1`.
   - For this case, it is not possible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n` is not equal to `k`. This is because the only way to have all cyclic shifts sorted is if all elements are the same, which would mean `n` sorted cyclic shifts, not `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases as described:
- When `k = 1`, it outputs a sequence that has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
- When `k ≥ 2` and `n == k`, it outputs a sequence that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
- When `k ≥ 2` and `n != k`, it correctly outputs `-1` because it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
