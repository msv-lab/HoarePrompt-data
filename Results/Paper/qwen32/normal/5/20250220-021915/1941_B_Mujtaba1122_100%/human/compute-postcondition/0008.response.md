The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value at index `i - 1` of the list by subtracting its current value from itself. Given that `i` is 1, the operation affects the element at index `0` of the list.

Initial State: `list` is [1, 0, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1

The element at index `0` in `list` is `1`. The operation `list[0] -= 1 * list[0]` translates to `list[0] -= 1 * 1`, which means `list[0]` becomes `1 - 1`, resulting in `0`.

Output State: **`list` is [0, 0, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**.
