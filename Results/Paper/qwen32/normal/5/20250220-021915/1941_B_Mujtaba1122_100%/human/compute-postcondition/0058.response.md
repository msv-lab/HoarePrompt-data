The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes a list `[0, 0, 0]` and mentions a condition checked by `func_1(list, n)` that is false. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the list or the result of `func_1(list, n)`; it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not require any further computation based on the provided initial state.

Output: **NO**
