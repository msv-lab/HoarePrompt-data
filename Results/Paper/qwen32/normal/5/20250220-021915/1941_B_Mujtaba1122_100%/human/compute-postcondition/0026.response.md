The code modifies the value at index `i - 1` in the `list` by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `i` is `1`, the operation affects the element at index `0` of the list. The value at index `0` is `1`, so after the operation, it becomes `1 - 1 * 1 = 0`.

Therefore, the updated list is `[0, 0, 0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `4`**.
