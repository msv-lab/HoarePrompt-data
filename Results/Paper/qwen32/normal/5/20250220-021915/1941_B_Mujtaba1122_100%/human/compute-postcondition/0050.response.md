Postcondition: **list is [0, 0, 0], i is 2, n is greater than 4, and the element at index `i - 1` of list (which is list[1]) is not 0**.

However, given the precondition that `list` is `[0, 0, 0]`, the element at index `i - 1` (which is `list[1]`) is 0, which contradicts the if condition `list[i - 1] != 0`. Therefore, the if condition cannot be true under the given precondition. If we assume the if condition must be true, then there is an inconsistency in the problem statement.

Since the task requires including the if condition in the postcondition, I will proceed with the logical extension of including the if condition as stated:

Postcondition: **list is [0, 0, 0], i is 2, n is greater than 4, and the element at index `i - 1` of list (which is list[1]) is not 0**.

Please note the logical inconsistency mentioned above.
