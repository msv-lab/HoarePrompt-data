The value at index `i` of `list` is updated to be its current value minus twice the value at index `i - 1`. Given `i` is `1`, `list[1]` is `2`, and `list[0]` is `1`, the new value of `list[1]` will be `2 - 2 * 1 = 0`. The other elements and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is `[1, 0, 0]`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `4`**.
