The code modifies the value at index `i - 1` of the list by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `i` is `1`, the value at index `0` of the list will be updated. The initial value at index `0` is `1`, so after the operation, it will become `1 - 1 * 1`, which is `0`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The list was initially `[1, 0, 0]` and is now `[0, 0, 0]`.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `4`**.
