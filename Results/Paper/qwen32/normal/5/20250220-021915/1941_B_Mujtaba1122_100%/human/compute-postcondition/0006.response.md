The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value at index `i + 1` of the list by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` from it. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the value at index `i + 1` (which is index 2) is modified by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` (which is index 0).

Initial values:
- `list` is [1, 2, 1]
- `n` is 3
- `i` is 1

The value at index 2 of `list` is 1, and the value at index 0 of `list` is 1. The operation `list[2] -= 1 * list[0]` translates to `list[2] = 1 - 1 * 1`, which results in `list[2] = 0`.

Therefore, the updated list becomes [1, 2, 0].

Output State: **`list` is [1, 2, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**.
