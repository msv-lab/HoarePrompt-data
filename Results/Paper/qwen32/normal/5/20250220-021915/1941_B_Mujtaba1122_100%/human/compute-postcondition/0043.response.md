The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value at index `i` of the list by subtracting twice the value at index `i - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `2`, so `list[i]` is `list[2]` which is `2`, and `list[i - 1]` is `list[1]` which is `1`. Therefore, the operation becomes `list[2] -= 2 * list[1]`, which translates to `list[2] -= 2 * 1` or `list[2] -= 2`. This results in `list[2]` changing from `2` to `0`.

The other elements of the list and the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 1, 0, 0]`, `i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `4`**.
