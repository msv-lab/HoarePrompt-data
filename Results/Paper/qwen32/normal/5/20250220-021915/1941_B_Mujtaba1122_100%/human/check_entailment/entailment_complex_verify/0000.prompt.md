You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    7
    
    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `n` iterations without returning `False`, indicating that all elements in `list` from index 0 to `n-1` are 0. The function will implicitly return `None`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the first `n` elements of the input list are all zeros. It returns `False` if any of these elements are not zero, and `True` if all of them are zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is an integer such that n >= 3 and n is equal to the length of list.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: [0, 0, 0]
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list remains `[0, 0, 0]`. If `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True, the current state of the program includes these conditions being satisfied. Otherwise, the condition checked by `func_1(list, n)` is false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list, which must be at least 3. It modifies the list in place and prints either 'no', 'YES', or 'NO' based on certain conditions. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**:
   - The operation described in the problem statement is:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - However, in the `func_2` function, the operation is incorrectly implemented as:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This means that the operation is not being applied correctly, as it is multiplying the values by the value of the previous element, which is not what the problem statement describes.

2. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements**:
   - The `func_1` function checks if all elements in the list are zero, but it is not being used correctly in `func_2`. The `func_2` function should check if the array can be made zero, not just if it is already zero.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The loop in `func_2` only runs for `i` from 1 to `n-2`, which is correct, but the way the operation is applied is incorrect.
   - The condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` is not sufficient to ensure that the operation can be applied correctly. It should check if the operation can be applied at least once, and then apply it until no more operations can be made.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

The program will not correctly determine the output for these cases due to the incorrect implementation of the operation.

### Correct Implementation Example:

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work as expected:

```python
def can_make_zero(a):
    n = len(a)
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while a[i] >= 2 and a[i - 1] >= 1 and a[i + 1] >= 1:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1
    return all(x == 0 for x in a)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        a = list(map(int, input[index + 1: index + 1 + n]))
        index += 1 + n
        if can_make_zero(a):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    print("\n".join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version properly implements the operation and checks if the array can be made zero.
