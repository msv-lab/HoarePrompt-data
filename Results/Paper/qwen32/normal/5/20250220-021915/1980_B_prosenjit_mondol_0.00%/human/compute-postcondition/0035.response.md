The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is a direct print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. It does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x` that are described in the initial state. These variables are either read from input or derived from input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
