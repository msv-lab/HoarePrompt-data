### Reasoning:

The given program implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not after sorting and removing the first `k` cubes. Let's break down the steps and verify if they align with the problem statement:

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the program reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the list `a` of cube values.
2. **Adjusting Indices**: The program adjusts the 1-based index `f` to 0-based by subtracting 1. Similarly, it adjusts `k` to 0-based.
3. **Extracting Favorite Cube Value**: The program stores the value of the favorite cube in `x`.
4. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.
5. **Decision Making**:
   - If the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list (`a[k]`) is greater than the value of the favorite cube (`x`), it means the favorite cube was not among the first `k` cubes after sorting, so it will not be removed. The program prints "NO".
   - If `a[k]` is less than `x`, the favorite cube was among the first `k` cubes after sorting, so it will be removed. The program prints "YES".
   - If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, the decision depends on whether there are more cubes with the same value as `x` among the first `k` cubes. If `k` is the last index (`n-1`), or if the cube at position `k-1` has a value less than `x`, the favorite cube could either be removed or not, so the program prints "MAYBE". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Verification:

- The program correctly handles the case where the favorite cube's value is greater than the `k`-th value after sorting.
- The program correctly handles the case where the favorite cube's value is less than the `k`-th value after sorting.
- The program correctly handles the ambiguous case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the `k`-th value after sorting, considering whether there are more cubes with the same value among the first `k` cubes.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
