Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is the first integer read from input; `f` is the second integer read from input minus 1; `k` is the third integer read from input minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order; `x` is the integer `a[f]` from the new list `a`. The condition `a[k] < x` does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`.**
