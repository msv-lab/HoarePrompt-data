The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and then stores them in a list `a`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `f` is an integer read from input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from input minus 1; `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
