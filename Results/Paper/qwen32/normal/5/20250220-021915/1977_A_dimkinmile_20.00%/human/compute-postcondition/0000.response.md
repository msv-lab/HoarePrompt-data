The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that there are `t` test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers within the range of 1 to 100. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` will be updated to the integers read from the input for the current test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input for the current test case.**
