You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads pairs of integers `n` and `m` from the input for up to 100 test cases and prints "Yes" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints "No".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The logic in the program is that if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes), the answer is "Yes", otherwise, it is "No".

However, this logic is not entirely correct. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not account for the possibility that Nikita might need to both add and remove cubes to reach the desired height. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it is possible for Nikita to add 3 cubes and remove 2 cubes, ending up with 3 cubes in total. Therefore, the correct condition should be that `n` must be at least `|m|` (the absolute value of `m`), but more importantly, `n` must be such that it allows for the possibility of reaching `m` through a combination of additions and subtractions.

The correct logic should be that `n` must be at least `m` if `m` is non-negative, and `n` must be at least `-m` if `m` is negative. However, since `m` is guaranteed to be non-negative according to the problem statement, the condition `n >= m` is actually sufficient for the problem as stated. But the program should also ensure that `n` is odd if `m` is not zero because `n` moves can only result in an odd number of cubes if `m` is not zero (since starting from 0, an odd number of moves will always result in an odd number of cubes).

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program does not fully account for the possibility of reaching `m` with `n` moves in all cases, especially when `m` is not zero and `n` is even. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the general case as described.

Correctness: **False**
