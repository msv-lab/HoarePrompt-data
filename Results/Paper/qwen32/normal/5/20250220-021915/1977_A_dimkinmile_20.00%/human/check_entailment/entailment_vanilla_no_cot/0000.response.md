Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The current implementation only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of reaching `m` cubes.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the net change in the number of cubes must be an even number. Specifically, `n - m` must be even and non-negative.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This program checks both conditions: whether `n` is at least `m` and whether the difference `n - m` is even.
