Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The logic in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" in that case, which is not the correct logic.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider that the number of cubes `m` can be achieved if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because:
- If `n - m` is even, it means we can make an equal number of addition and removal moves to end up with `m` cubes.
- If `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes because we would always end up with one more or one less cube than `m`.

The correct logic should be:
```python
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Given the current logic in the program, it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
