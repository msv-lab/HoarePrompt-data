To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low + 1 < high`. This condition must be true for the loop to continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found
- `st` is a set containing `n // 2`
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `high` is set to `n // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `n // 2`.

We need to ensure that `low + 1 < high` is satisfied. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, and `high` or `low` is set to `n // 2` based on the condition, we need to adjust `low` and `high` accordingly.

From the given information, we know that `mid` is `n // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `high` is set to `n // 2`. This implies that `high` was previously greater than `n // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is not greater than `k`, then `low` is set to `n // 2`. This implies that `low` was previously less than `n // 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the adjustment, `low + 1 < high` holds true.

Let's consider the two cases:
1. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `high` is set to `n // 2`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `low` should be `n // 2 - 1` (or any value less than `n // 2`).
2. If `arr[mid]` is not greater than `k`, then `low` is set to `n // 2`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `high` should be `n // 2 + 1` (or any value greater than `n // 2`).

Since we don't know the exact value of `arr[mid]` and `k`, we can adjust the state to ensure that `low` and `high` are set in such a way that `low + 1 < high` is true. One straightforward way to do this is to set `low` to `n // 2 - 1` and `high` to `n // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `low` is `n // 2 - 1`, `high` is `n // 2 + 1`**
