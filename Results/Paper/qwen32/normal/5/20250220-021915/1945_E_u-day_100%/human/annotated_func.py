#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and returns the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which implies it reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and returns these integers as a map object.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from substrings of the input line, which is split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns these integers as a map object.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, so there are no variables or relationships to describe.
def func_2():

    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer representing the number to be found in the permutation, arr is a list of integers representing the permutation, pos is an integer representing the index of k in arr, low and high are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and st is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search.

    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the `mid` values checked during the binary search, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`.

    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the `mid` values checked during the binary search, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a binary search on a list `arr` to find an integer `k`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the list, otherwise it prints `1` and the 1-based index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `k`, followed by the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `0` if `k` is not found.
