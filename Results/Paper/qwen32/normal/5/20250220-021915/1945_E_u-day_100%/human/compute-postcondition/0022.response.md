The value of `low` is updated to the value of `mid`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is `n // 2`, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
