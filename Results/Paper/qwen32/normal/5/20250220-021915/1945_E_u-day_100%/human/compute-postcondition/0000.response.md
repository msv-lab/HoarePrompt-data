To determine the Output State, we need to understand how `func_1()` modifies or returns the values for `n` and `k`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the problem statement, we can only assume that it returns a tuple where the first element is assigned to `n` and the second element is assigned to `k`.

Given that `n` and `k` are the only variables being modified by this line of code, and no other variables are affected, we need to account for the new values of `n` and `k` returned by `func_1()`.

Let's denote the return values of `func_1()` as `new_n` and `new_k`. Therefore, after the execution of `n, k = func_1()`, `n` will hold the value of `new_n` and `k` will hold the value of `new_k`.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `n`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation, `pos` is an integer representing the index of `k` in `arr`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search.**
