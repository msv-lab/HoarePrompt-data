The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the integer `1`. The values of the variables `low`, `high`, `st`, `pos`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` are described in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the execution of the `print` statement will not depend on any of these variables.

Output: **1**
