You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and returns the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which implies it reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and returns these integers as a map object.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a binary search on a list `arr` to find an integer `k`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the list, otherwise it prints `1` and the 1-based index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `k`, followed by the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `0` if `k` is not found.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find using binary search.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps on the permutation before running the binary search.
- The goal is to rearrange the permutation so that after the binary search, `p_l` (the element at the final `l` index) is equal to `x`.
- Binary search is performed with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` initially, and it continues until `r - l = 1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of permutation) and `x` (number to find).
   - It then reads the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program searches for the position of `x` in the permutation and stores it in `pos`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the binary search on the permutation.
   - It initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `n`.
   - It runs the binary search loop and keeps track of the `mid` positions in a set `st`.

4. **Checking the Result:**
   - After the binary search loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`.
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and suggests a swap between `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly simulate the binary search as described in the problem statement.
  - The problem specifies `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` initially, but the program uses `l = 0` and `r = n`.
  - The problem specifies `1 <= i, j <= n` for swaps, but the program suggests `low + 1` and `pos + 1` which might be incorrect if `low` or `pos` are `0`.
- The program does not consider the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to achieve the desired result.
- The program only checks if a single swap is sufficient, but it does not explore the possibility of using two swaps.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It does not handle the binary search correctly and does not explore the possibility of using up to 2 swaps.
