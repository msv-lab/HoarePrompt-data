The code snippet updates the value of `mid` based on the current values of `low` and `high`. Given that `low` is `n // 2 - 1` and `high` is `n // 2 + 1`, the new value of `mid` will be the integer division of their sum.

Let's calculate the new value of `mid`:
- `low + high = (n // 2 - 1) + (n // 2 + 1) = n // 2 + n // 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 * (n // 2) = n`
- `mid = n // 2`

Since `mid` was originally `n // 2` and the calculation results in the same value, `mid` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `low` is `n // 2 - 1`, `high` is `n // 2 + 1`**
