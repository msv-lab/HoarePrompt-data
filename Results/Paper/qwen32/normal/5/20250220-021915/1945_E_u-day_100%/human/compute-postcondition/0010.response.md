The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search. If the current element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since only `i` and `n` can be adjusted in the loop head, and `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search. If the current element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `i` is `i + 1`**.
