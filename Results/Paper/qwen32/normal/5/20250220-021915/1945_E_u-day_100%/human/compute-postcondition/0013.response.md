Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `n`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in the list `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `st` remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not modified within the loop body.
