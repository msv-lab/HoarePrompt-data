The code snippet `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `mid` is `n // 2`. Thus, the set `st` will now contain `n // 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`**.
