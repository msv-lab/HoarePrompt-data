The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to the variable `pos`. Therefore, `pos` will no longer be -1 but will instead hold the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is `i`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search. The current element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `k`.**
