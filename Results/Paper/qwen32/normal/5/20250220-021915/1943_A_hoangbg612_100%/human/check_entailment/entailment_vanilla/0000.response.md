Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is not necessary for the optimal solution and can be misleading in terms of the strategy, as the optimal strategy does not depend on the order of elements but rather their presence and count.

3. **Tracking Elements**:
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX value as elements are processed.

4. **Processing Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` based on the current element and its count in `M`.
   - If the current element is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop and sets `cur` to `cur + 1`, implying that the MEX is found.
   - If the current element is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of that element in `M`.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, if all elements from `0` to `cur` are present in `N` (checked by comparing the sum of counts in `M` with `S`), it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of elements that appear exactly once in `N`.

6. **Determining the Final MEX**:
   - If there are at least two elements in `cnt`, it sets `cur` to the second smallest element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur` as the MEX of the array `c` after the game.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect logic, as the optimal strategy does not depend on the order of elements.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly handle cases where elements are not consecutive or when Bob's strategy affects the outcome.
- **Handling of Counts**: The program does not correctly account for Bob's optimal strategy of minimizing the MEX. It only considers the counts of elements and their presence, but does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game turns and keep track of the elements chosen by Alice and Bob. The key is to ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX while Bob minimizes it. This involves a more strategic approach rather than just counting elements.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the provided program's logic and approach, it is incorrect for solving the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
