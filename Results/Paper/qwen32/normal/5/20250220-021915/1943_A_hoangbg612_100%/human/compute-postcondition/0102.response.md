Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cur` is an integer, and `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` where the value is 1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the dictionary `M` remains unchanged. The variable `cur` remains the same as it was initially because the loop does not modify `cur`. The list `cnt` will contain all the keys from `M` that have a value of 1.
