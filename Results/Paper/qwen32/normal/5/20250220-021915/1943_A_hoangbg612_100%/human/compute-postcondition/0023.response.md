The given code snippet updates the dictionary `M` by setting the value for the key `cur` to `1`. This means that if `cur` was already a key in the dictionary `M`, its value will be updated to `1`. If `cur` was not a key in the dictionary `M`, it will be added with the value `1`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `T` remains the same, representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0.
- `S` remains the same, representing the input integer.
- `N` remains the same, representing a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least one element.
- `num` remains the same, representing the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`.
- `cur` remains the same, as it is updated to `num` before the code snippet.
- `M` is updated to include the key `cur` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`; `cur` is updated to `num`; `M` is a dictionary with keys `-1`, `cur - 1` (if `num > cur + 1`), `cur`, and the value for the key `cur` is `1`.**
