Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is a dictionary with keys `-1`, `cur - 1` (if `num > cur + 1`), `cur`, and the value for the key `cur` is `1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the same or is updated to `num` if `num > cur`, and `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur` and the value is `2`.**
