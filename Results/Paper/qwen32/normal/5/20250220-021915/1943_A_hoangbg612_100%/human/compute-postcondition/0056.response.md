The code snippet `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `N`. The variables `T`, `cur`, and `M` remain unchanged, while `S` retains its value as an input integer. The new variable `N` is introduced and assigned the list of integers.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `cur` is unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is unchanged, `N` is a list of integers from the input.**
