### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem. The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have optimally played their turns.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
4. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sorting**: The program sorts the input array `N`. Sorting helps in determining the smallest numbers first, which is crucial for calculating the MEX.
2. **Tracking Elements**: It uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each element in `N`.
3. **Calculating MEX**:
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the current MEX (`cur`).
   - If an element in `N` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If the sum of counts of elements in `M` equals `S` (the size of `N`), it increments `cur` by 1.
4. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - It checks if there are at least two elements in `M` with a count of 1. If so, it sets `cur` to the second smallest such element.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It does not simulate the game turns and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. For example, the condition `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` is incorrect for determining the MEX.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Special Cases**:
   - The part where it checks for elements with a count of 1 and sets `cur` to the second smallest such element is not logical for determining the MEX.

#### Correct Approach:
- Simulate the game turns by alternating between Alice and Bob.
- Use a set to keep track of the elements in `c` and determine the MEX after all elements have been processed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and does not correctly calculate the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: False**
