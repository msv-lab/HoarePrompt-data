Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cur` is the last integer in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last integer in `N`. `cnt` is an empty list. `T` is decremented by 1. `S` is the input integer. `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input. `M[k]` is equal to 1.**
