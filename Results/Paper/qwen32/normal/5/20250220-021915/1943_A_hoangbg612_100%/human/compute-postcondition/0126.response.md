Output State: **`M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer incremented by 1, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, `num` is the next element in `N` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `M`, `cur`, `cnt`, `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain the same, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
