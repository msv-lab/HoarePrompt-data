The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` adds the key `k` to the end of the list `cnt`. Given the initial state, if `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` already contains the key `k`. If `M[k]` is not 1, `cnt` remains an empty list. After executing the code, `cnt` will definitely include the key `k` regardless of its previous state.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cur` is an integer, and `cnt` is a list that includes the key `k`. If `M[k]` was 1, `cnt` now has `k` included (no change in this specific condition). If `M[k]` was not 1, `cnt` now includes `k`. `k` is the next key in `M` after the previous `k`.**
