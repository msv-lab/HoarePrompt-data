The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` will add the current key `k` to the list `cnt`. The initial state tells us that `cnt` is an empty list, and `k` is a key in the dictionary `M` with a value of 1. After the code is executed, `cnt` will contain the key `k`.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`, and the current key `k` in `M` has a value of 1.**
