Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific integer value `cur` based on the provided integers. The value `cur` is determined by sorting the list of integers and analyzing their frequencies and values, ultimately reflecting a condition related to the distribution of unique and repeated numbers in the list.**
