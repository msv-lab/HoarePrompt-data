The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `cur` is -1, after the code execution, `cur` will be 0. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is 0; `M` is an empty dictionary; `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**
