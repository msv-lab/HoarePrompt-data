The code assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` is no longer empty but now contains one key-value pair where the key is `cur` and the value is `1`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `cur` and the value is `1`; `num` is greater than `cur`; `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
