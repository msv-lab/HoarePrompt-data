Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The initial state about the test cases (each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers) remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T`, `cur`, `S`, and `M` are unchanged. `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k] == 1`. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cur` is an integer, and `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` where the value is 1. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: M is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from N and values as their counts; cur is the second element of cnt if the length of cnt is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise cur remains unchanged; cnt is a list containing all keys from M where the value is 1; T is decremented by the number of keys in M; S is the input integer; N is the sorted list of integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
