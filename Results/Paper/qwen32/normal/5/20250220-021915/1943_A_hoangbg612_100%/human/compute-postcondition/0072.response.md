Initial State: `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`

The code snippet provided is `cur += 1`. This line increments the value of the variable `cur` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `cur + 1`**

In natural language: The value of `cur` has been increased by 1. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged.
