The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `cnt`. This action does not affect the variables `T`, `cur`, `M`, or `S`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged. The only change is the creation of the new list `cnt`.

Output State: **`T` is unchanged, `cur` is increased by 1 if the sum of the values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged; `cnt` is an empty list.**
