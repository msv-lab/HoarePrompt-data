Output State: **`M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` where the value is 1 (which is an empty list since `M` is empty), `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer. The current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged as their values are not affected by the executed code.
