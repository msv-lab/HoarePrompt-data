Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`. If `num` > `cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `num + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur - 1` if `num` > `cur + 1`, otherwise the key is either `-1` or `cur`. The value in `M` is `1`.**
