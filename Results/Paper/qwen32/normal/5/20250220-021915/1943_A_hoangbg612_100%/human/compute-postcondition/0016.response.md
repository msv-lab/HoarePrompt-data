The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` attempts to increment the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. However, since `M` is initially an empty dictionary and `cur` is -1, `M[cur]` does not exist, leading to a `KeyError`. 

To avoid this error, the code would typically need to check if the key exists or initialize it first. Since the code as given will raise an error, we cannot proceed with the simulation as intended. 

Given the constraints and the code provided, the output state cannot be determined without modification to handle the non-existent key. However, if we assume the code should initialize the key if it does not exist, the output state would be:

If we hypothetically handle the key initialization, the output state would be:
- `M` would have the key `-1` with a value of `1` because `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and `cur` is `-1`.
- All other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Hypothetical Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is -1; `M` is a dictionary with the key `-1` having the value `1`; `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**

But strictly adhering to the provided code without any assumptions or error handling, the code will raise a `KeyError`, and the output state cannot be determined as specified.
