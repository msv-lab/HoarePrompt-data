Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `N` and values as their counts, `cur` is the last integer in `N`, `cnt` is an empty list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is the input integer, and `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input. The sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`.**
