The code snippet `inpstr = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `n` is an integer within a smaller range, and `s` is a string of length `n` with specific constraints.

Since the code only reads input and assigns it to `inpstr`, the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The new variable `inpstr` is introduced and holds the value of the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `inpstr` is the input string.**
