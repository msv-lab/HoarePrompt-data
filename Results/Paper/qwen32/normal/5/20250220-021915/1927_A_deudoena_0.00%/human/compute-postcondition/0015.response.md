Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `j` is the character at index `k + 1` in `inpstr`, `j` is not 'B', `ind1` is `k + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `i`, `j`, and `ind1` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
