The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `ind1`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine a specific value for `ind1`. However, we know that `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`j` is a character, and the current value of `j` is 'B'; `ind1` is equal to `i`.**
