You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the first 'B' from the end of `inpstr` if a 'B' is found, otherwise `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: len(inpstr) + 1 if no 'B' is found in inpstr, otherwise the number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, inclusive (where ind1 is the index of the first 'B' from the start and ind2 is the index of the first 'B' from the end)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string. The function returns the number of contiguous segments of 'B's in the string `s` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
