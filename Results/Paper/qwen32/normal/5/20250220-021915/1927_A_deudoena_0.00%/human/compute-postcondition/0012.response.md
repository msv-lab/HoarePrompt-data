Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at the new index `i` in `inpstr`. If `j` is 'B', `ind1` is set to the incremented value of `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `ind1` and the loop or if statement continues.**
