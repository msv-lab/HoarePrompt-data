The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement. This statement does not affect any variables directly. It only serves to exit the nearest enclosing loop or switch-case structure. Given that the `break` statement does not change any of the variable values, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 2, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`, `inpstr` must have at least 1 character, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
