You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. Additionally, the list `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. Additionally, the list `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop completes all iterations without returning 'NO'. The state of `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits` remains unchanged as per the initial conditions.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive, and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns 'NO' in five different cases and 'YES' in one specific case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'NO'

Case_6: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
