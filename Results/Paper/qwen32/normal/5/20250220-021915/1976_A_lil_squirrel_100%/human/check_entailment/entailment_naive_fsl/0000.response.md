Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the condition where the password consists only of digits or only of letters. Specifically, the code checks if the letters and digits are sorted individually and if there is no digit after a letter, but it does not ensure that all letters come before any digits. This means that a password like "a2b3" would incorrectly be considered valid.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
a2b3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
YES
```

In this case, the letter 'b' is followed by the digit '3', which violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. The code does not catch this scenario because it only checks for the order within the groups of letters and digits separately, not the overall order between them.

To fix this, the code should ensure that all letters come before any digits in the password. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if len(letters) + len(digits) != n:
        return 'NO'
    if len(letters) > 0 and len(digits) > 0 and password.index(digits[0]) < password.rindex(letters[-1]):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This version ensures that all letters come before any digits by checking the position of the first digit and the last letter in the password.
