You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. Additionally, the list `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. Additionally, the list `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop completes all iterations without returning 'NO'. The state of `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits` remains unchanged as per the initial conditions.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific criteria: all letters must be in non-decreasing order, all digits must be in non-decreasing order, and no letter should be immediately followed by a digit. It returns 'YES' if the password meets all these criteria, otherwise it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Password Composition**: The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Digit Placement**: No digit should come after a letter.
3. **Ordering**:
   - All digits should be in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each containing a password. For each password, it performs the following checks:
1. **Separation of Letters and Digits**:
   - It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
2. **Sorting Check**:
   - It checks whether the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks whether the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Digit Placement Check**:
   - It iterates through the password and ensures that no digit follows a letter.
4. **Output**:
   - If any of the checks fail, it returns "NO".
   - If all checks pass, it returns "YES".

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Separation of Letters and Digits**:
   - The program correctly separates letters and digits into two lists.
2. **Sorting Check**:
   - It correctly checks whether the `letters` list and `digits` list are sorted.
3. **Digit Placement Check**:
   - The program correctly checks that no digit follows a letter by iterating through the password and comparing adjacent characters.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the example inputs provided in the problem:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `12ac`
   - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
   - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
   - No digit follows a letter.
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `123wa`
   - Letters: `['a', 'w']` (not sorted)
   - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
   - Output: `NO` (Correct, because letters are not sorted)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `allllmost`
   - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
   - Digits: `[]`
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `ac123`
   - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
   - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
   - But a digit follows a letter.
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `011679`
   - Letters: `[]`
   - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the checks required by the problem statement and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
