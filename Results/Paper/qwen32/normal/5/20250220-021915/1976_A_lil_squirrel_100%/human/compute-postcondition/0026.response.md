Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, sorted in non-decreasing order, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear, sorted in non-decreasing order. Additionally, for any index `i` where `0 <= i < n-1`, it is not the case that `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit.**
