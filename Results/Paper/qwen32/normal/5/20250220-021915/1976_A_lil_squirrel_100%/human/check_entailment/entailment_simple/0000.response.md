### Reasoning:

1. **Condition 1**: The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - The problem states that the input is guaranteed to meet this condition, so we don't need to check it.

2. **Condition 2**: There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
   - The program iterates through the password and checks if a letter is followed by a digit. If it finds such a case, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Condition 3**: All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The program separates digits from letters and checks if the list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it's not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Condition 4**: All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Similarly, the program checks if the list of letters is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it's not, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Check**: If none of the conditions above are violated, the program returns 'YES'.

### Evaluation of the Program:
- The program correctly separates letters and digits.
- It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It checks if any digit follows a letter in the password.

Given the provided test cases and the logic of the program, it correctly determines whether a password is strong according to the specified conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
