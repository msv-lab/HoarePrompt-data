To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `y`, `x`, and the range parameters `x - 1` and `1`.

The `for` loop statement is:
```
for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range `(x - 1, 1, -1)` must contain at least one value. The range function `range(start, stop, step)` generates numbers starting from `start` and decrements by `step` until it reaches `stop` (exclusive). Here, `start` is `x - 1`, `stop` is `1`, and `step` is `-1`.

For the range to contain at least one value, `start` must be greater than `stop` because the step is negative. Therefore, `x - 1` must be greater than `1`, which implies `x` must be greater than `2`.

Given the initial state that `x` is an integer such that `2 <= x <= 1000`, we need to adjust `x` to be greater than `2` for the loop to execute. The variable `y` is the loop variable and does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts.

The variable `max_val` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`x` is an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`, `max_val` is 1**
