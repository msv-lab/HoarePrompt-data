The value of `max_val` is updated to the value of `y`. The value of `x` remains an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`, and it is still divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). Additionally, the condition `2 * y < x` remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`, `max_val` is `y`, `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), and `2 * y < x`.**
