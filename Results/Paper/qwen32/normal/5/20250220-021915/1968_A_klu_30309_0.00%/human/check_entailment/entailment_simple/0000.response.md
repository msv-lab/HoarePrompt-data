### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Let's break down the logic of the provided function `func_1(x)`:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max_val` to 1. This variable will hold the value of \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

2. **Loop through possible values of \( y \)**: The loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2. This means it starts with the largest possible value of \( y \) and works its way down.

3. **Check if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)**: The condition `if x % y == 0` checks if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \). If it is, then \(\gcd(x, y) = y\).

4. **Check if \( 2 \cdot y \ge x \)**: If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), the program then checks if \( 2 \cdot y \ge x \). If this condition is true, it means that \( y \) is a good candidate because \(\gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2y\), which is maximized when \( y \) is as large as possible under the constraint \( 2 \cdot y \ge x \). In this case, the function immediately returns \( y \).

5. **Update `max_val`**: If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) but \( 2 \cdot y < x \), the program updates `max_val` to \( y \). This ensures that `max_val` holds the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x / 2 \) if no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 \cdot y \ge x \).

6. **Return `max_val`**: If the loop completes without finding a \( y \) such that \( 2 \cdot y \ge x \), the function returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x / 2 \).

The logic seems sound, and the function correctly handles the constraints and conditions given in the problem statement. The function efficiently finds the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
