The code snippet appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the `coord` list. Therefore, the `coord` list, which was initially empty, now contains one element: the tuple `(x, y)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
