The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value minus 1, `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**
