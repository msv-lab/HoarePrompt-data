The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to the new integers read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is 3**.
