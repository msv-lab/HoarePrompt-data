The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `4`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `3`, `i` should be set to `0` at the start of the loop.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 5 elements (the original 4 elements plus the new tuple `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
