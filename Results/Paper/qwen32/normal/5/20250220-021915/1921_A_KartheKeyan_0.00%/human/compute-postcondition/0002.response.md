In the provided task, the `while` loop condition is `while n:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
- `n` is an input integer.

To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, `n` must be non-zero. The coordinates `x_i` and `y_i` are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Answer:
State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` must be a non-zero integer.**
