### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap:
The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs sequentially with specific periodicities. The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the tribe waits for the (i+1)-th sign to occur strictly after the i-th sign.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The number of test cases (`num_tests`) is read.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of signs (`n`) is read.
     - The periodicities of the signs (`nums`) are read into a list.

2. **Processing Each Sign**:
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each sign in `nums`, the program calculates the year the sign will occur using the formula: `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is strictly after `start_year`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the `start_year`, which is the year the n-th sign occurs.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

For the first test case:
- `n = 6`
- `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Initial `start_year = 0`
- Iteration:
  - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The result matches the expected output of 36.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the program's state at key points:
- Before the function call, the input is correctly parsed.
- After processing each sign, `start_year` is correctly updated to the next occurrence year.
- After processing all signs for a test case, `start_year` is the year the n-th sign occurs.

#### Evaluation:
The annotations support the correctness of the program. The logic `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly calculates the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case based on the given periodicities and the sequential requirement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
