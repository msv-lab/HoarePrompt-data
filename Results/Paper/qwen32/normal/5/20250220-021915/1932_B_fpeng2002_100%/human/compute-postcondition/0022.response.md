Output State: **`start_year` is `((0 // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]`, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `x + 1`**

In simpler terms, `start_year` is recalculated based on the new value of `x`, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` remains the same, `nums` remains the same, and `x` is incremented by 1.
