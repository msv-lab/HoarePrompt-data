The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1. The value of `start_year` remains unchanged as it is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list. The precondition that `num_tests` must be greater than 0 still holds, but now `num_tests` is one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0.**
