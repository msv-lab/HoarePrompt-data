### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The Chaya tribe's signs of the apocalypse occur at periodic intervals, and each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The task is to determine the year when the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

#### Annotations Recap:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities.
- It initializes `start_year` to 0.
- For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
  - Dividing `start_year` by the periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to get the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly after `start_year`.
  - Multiplying the result by `nums[x]` to get the exact year the sign will occur.
- It updates `start_year` to this new year and continues to the next sign.
- Finally, it prints the year when the n-th sign occurs.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment claims that the program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur by iteratively determining the next occurrence year for each sign, starting from year 0 and ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
The key part of the program is:
```python
start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
This line calculates the next year that is a multiple of `nums[x]` and is strictly greater than `start_year`.

Let's verify this with the provided example:

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Calculation:
  - For `nums[0] = 3`: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For `nums[1] = 2`: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - For `nums[2] = 4`: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - For `nums[3] = 5`: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - For `nums[4] = 9`: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - For `nums[5] = 18`: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
- Output: `36`

This matches the expected output.

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
- Calculation:
  - For `nums[0] = 1`: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For `nums[1] = 2`: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - For `nums[2] = 3`: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For `nums[3] = 4`: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - For `nums[4] = 5`: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
- Output: `5`

This matches the expected output.

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
- Calculation:
  - For `nums[0] = 1`: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For `nums[1] = 1`: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
  - For `nums[2] = 1`: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
  - For `nums[3] = 1`: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
  - For `nums[4] = 1`: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
- Output: `5`

This matches the expected output.

**Fourth Test Case:**
- Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
- Calculation:
  - For `nums[0] = 50`: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - For `nums[1] = 30`: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
  - For `nums[2] = 711`: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - For `nums[3] = 200`: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
  - For `nums[4] = 503`: `start_year = (900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - For `nums[5] = 1006`: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
- Output: `2012`

This matches the expected output.

Based on the detailed evaluation, the program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
