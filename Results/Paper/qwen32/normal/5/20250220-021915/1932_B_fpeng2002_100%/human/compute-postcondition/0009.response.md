Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer minus 1; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 and must have at least one element; `start_year` is `(nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`; `x` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to `(nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
