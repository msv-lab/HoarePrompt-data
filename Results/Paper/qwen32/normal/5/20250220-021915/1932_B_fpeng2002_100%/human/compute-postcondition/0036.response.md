The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range `0, len(nums)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `x + 1` and `num_tests` is 0. The loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list, so for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the bounds of the `nums` list.

Given that `x` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `x` to be the next value in the range. If `x` was `x + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the next index in the range.

Let's denote the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration as `x_prev`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `x_prev + 1`.

Since `x_prev` is `x + 1` from the previous iteration, `x` at the start of the next iteration should be `x + 2` (but since we typically denote the previous `x` as `x`, we simply say `x + 1`).

The `start_year` and `num_tests` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`start_year` is the next multiple of `nums[x]` greater than or equal to the previous `start_year`, `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `x + 1`**
