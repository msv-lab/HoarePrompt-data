The code snippet updates the value of `start_year` based on the current value of `start_year` and the value at index `x` in the list `nums`. Given that `start_year` is initially 0, the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` simplifies to `(0 // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which further simplifies to `1 * nums[x]` or `nums[x]`.

Therefore, the value of `start_year` becomes `nums[x]`. The values of `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start_year` is `nums[x]`, `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.**
