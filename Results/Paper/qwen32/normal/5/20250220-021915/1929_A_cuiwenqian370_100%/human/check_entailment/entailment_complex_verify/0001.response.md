### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the problem and the provided solution:

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the array elements.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

#### Key Insight:
To maximize the beauty, the differences between consecutive elements should be maximized. This is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array is maximized compared to any other arrangement.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, it calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements (since the array is sorted, `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` simplifies to `array[i] - array[i - 1]`).
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads all input data at once, processes each test case, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Annotations Validation:
- **State of `func_1`**: The array is sorted, and the beauty is calculated correctly as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **State of `func_2`**: The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases, computes the results using `func_1`, and prints them.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that sorting the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty and that the program correctly implements this logic. The annotations support this conclusion.

#### Conclusion:
Given the problem description, the provided solution, and the annotations, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for each test case by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
