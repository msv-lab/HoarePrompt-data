Reasoning:
The program aims to calculate the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally. The function `func_1` sorts the array and calculates the beauty based on the sorted array, which is a correct approach to maximize the beauty because sorting the array will maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order. This is crucial because the maximum beauty is achieved when the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. By sorting, the smallest element is first, the largest is last, and the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Calculating Beauty**: After sorting, the function calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` simplifies to `array[i] - array[i - 1]` because `array[i]` is always greater than or equal to `array[i - 1]`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases, processes each one using `func_1`, and stores the results. It then prints each result, which is the maximum beauty for each test case.

The code correctly implements the above logic and handles the input/output as described in the problem statement. The provided example cases also match the expected output, confirming the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
