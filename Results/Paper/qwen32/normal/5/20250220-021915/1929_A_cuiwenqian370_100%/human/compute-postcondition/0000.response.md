The code snippet provided only assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This does not modify the `array` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The `sys.stdin.read` function is typically used to read input from standard input, but in this case, it is simply being assigned to a variable without being called.

Output State: **array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`.**
