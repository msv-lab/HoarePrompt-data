To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to break down the problem description and the solution provided.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Input**: 
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the array elements.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, it calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements (since the array is sorted, `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` simplifies to `array[i] - array[i - 1]`).
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads all input data at once, processes each test case, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Sorting for Maximum Beauty**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.
- **Handling Input and Output**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs the results as required.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for each test case by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **True**
