### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's systematically analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries.

**Problem Breakdown:**
1. **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the array elements.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

**Solution Analysis:**
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, it calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted in ascending order, the absolute difference `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` simplifies to `array[i] - array[i - 1]`.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads all input data at once, processes each test case using `func_1`, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

**Function Summaries:**
- **Function `func_1`**: This function takes an array, sorts it, and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

**Verification:**
- **Sorting for Maximum Beauty**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty. This is because the maximum difference between any two elements is achieved when they are placed as far apart as possible in the sorted order.
- **Handling Input and Output**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs the results as required.

**Example Validation:**
Let's validate the program using the provided example:

**Input:**
```
5
3
2 1 3
3
69 69 69
5
100 54 80 43 90
4
3 4 3 3
2
2 1
```

**Output:**
```
2
0
57
1
1
```

- **Test Case 1**: Sorting `[2, 1, 3]` gives `[1, 2, 3]`. Beauty = `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`.
- **Test Case 2**: Sorting `[69, 69, 69]` gives `[69, 69, 69]`. Beauty = `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`.
- **Test Case 3**: Sorting `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. Beauty = `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57`.
- **Test Case 4**: Sorting `[3, 4, 3, 3]` gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. Beauty = `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`.
- **Test Case 5**: Sorting `[2, 1]` gives `[1, 2]`. Beauty = `(2 - 1) = 1`.

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem by sorting the array to maximize the beauty and handling multiple test cases as required.

**Final: True**
