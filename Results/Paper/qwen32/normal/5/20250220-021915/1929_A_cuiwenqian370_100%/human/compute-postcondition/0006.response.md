The code snippet assigns the value of the integer conversion of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. Given that `index` is 1, `n` will be the integer value of the second element in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input such that the integer value of the first element is at least 1; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
