### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that it correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case as per the provided problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - The task is to rearrange the array elements to maximize this beauty.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes an array of integers, sorts it, and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
     - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty.
     - The function returns the computed beauty.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of elements and the elements themselves.
     - It then calls `func_1` to compute the beauty of the array for that test case.
     - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

3. **Validation with Examples:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
     - Sorted Array: `1 2 3`
     - Beauty: \( (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
     - Output: `2`

   - **Second Test Case:**
     - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
     - Sorted Array: `69 69 69`
     - Beauty: \( (69-69) + (69-69) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
     - Output: `0`

   - **Third Test Case:**
     - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
     - Sorted Array: `43 54 80 90 100`
     - Beauty: \( (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \)
     - Output: `57`

   - **Fourth Test Case:**
     - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
     - Sorted Array: `3 3 3 4`
     - Beauty: \( (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \)
     - Output: `1`

   - **Fifth Test Case:**
     - Input: `2`, `2 1`
     - Sorted Array: `1 2`
     - Beauty: \( (2-1) = 1 \)
     - Output: `1`

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Thus, the program meets the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
