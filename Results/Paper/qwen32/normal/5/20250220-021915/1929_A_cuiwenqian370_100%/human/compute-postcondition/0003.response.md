The code snippet `index = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `index`. The values of `array`, `data`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1.**
