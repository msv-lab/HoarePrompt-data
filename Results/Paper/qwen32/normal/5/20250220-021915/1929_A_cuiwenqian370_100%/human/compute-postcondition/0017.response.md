The code snippet `result = func_1(array)` updates the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1` with `array` as its argument. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be at least 0; `index` is `3 + n + n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
