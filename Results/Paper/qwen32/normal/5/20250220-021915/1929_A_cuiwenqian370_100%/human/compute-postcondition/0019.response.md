The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. However, the loop's execution depends on the variable `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, ensuring it is still at least 0.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be at least 0; `index` is `3 + n + n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)` and the newly appended `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**
