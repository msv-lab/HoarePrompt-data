Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **`data`**: A list of strings.
   - No specific values are provided for the strings within the list, so we can't determine the exact contents of `data`.

2. **`t`**: An integer with the value of 2.
   - This is explicitly given.

3. **`index`**: Calculated as `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + 1`.
   - `n1, n2, ..., nt` are not defined or provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `index` cannot be determined. However, it is calculated based on these variables.

4. **`results`**: A list containing at least 3 `result` values from `func_1(array)`.
   - `func_1(array)` is not defined or provided, so we don't know the exact values that `results` contains. However, we know it contains at least 3 elements.

5. **`result`**: The last element in `results`.
   - Since `results` is a list with at least 3 elements, `result` is the value at `results[-1]`.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The statement `print(result)` will print the last element of the `results` list.

### Conclusion:

Given that `result` is the last element of the `results` list, and `results` contains at least 3 elements, the output will be the value of the last element in `results`. However, without knowing the specific values in `results`, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **result (where result is the last element in the results list)**
