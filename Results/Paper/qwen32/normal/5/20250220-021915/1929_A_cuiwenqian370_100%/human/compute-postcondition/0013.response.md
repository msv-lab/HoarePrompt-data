The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of the element in `data` at the position specified by `index`. Given the initial state, `index` is `2 + n`, so the new value of `n` will be the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be at least 0, `index` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
