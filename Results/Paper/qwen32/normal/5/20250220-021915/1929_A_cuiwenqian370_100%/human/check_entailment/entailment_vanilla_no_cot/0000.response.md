Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the beauty of the array after sorting it, but this does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty. To maximize the beauty, the strategy should be to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. Here's the corrected approach:

1. Sort the array.
2. Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning (smallest element) and one at the end (largest element) of the sorted array.
3. Alternate between picking elements from the end and the beginning to maximize the differences.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
    new_array = []
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_array.append(array[left])
        else:
            new_array.append(array[left])
            new_array.append(array[right])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    for i in range(1, len(new_array)):
        beauty += abs(new_array[i] - new_array[i - 1])
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version of `func_1` will yield the maximum beauty of the array by strategically arranging the elements.
