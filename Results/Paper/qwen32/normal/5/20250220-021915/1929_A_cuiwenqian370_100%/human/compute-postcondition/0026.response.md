To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the total number of iterations (equal to the first element in `data`).
   - `index` starts at 1.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each iteration, `n` is the integer value at `data[index]`.
   - `array` is then a list of integers derived from `data[index + 1: index + 1 + n]`.
   - `index` is incremented by `n + 1` to point to the next `n` value.
   - `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`, which is appended to `results`.

3. **Output State after Each Iteration:**
   - After 1 iteration: `index` is `2 + n`, `results` contains one `result`.
   - After 2 iterations: `index` is `3 + n + n`, `results` contains two `result`s.
   - After 3 iterations: `index` is `4 + 2n + n`, `results` contains three `result`s.

### Final State:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- After `t` iterations, `index` will point to the end of the `data` list.
- `results` will contain `t` `result`s, each derived from a different `array`.

### Calculation of Final `index`:
- After the first iteration, `index` is `2 + n1`.
- After the second iteration, `index` is `2 + n1 + 1 + n2`.
- After the third iteration, `index` is `2 + n1 + 1 + n2 + 1 + n3`.
- Generalizing, after `t` iterations, `index` will be `2 + (n1 + n2 + ... + nt) + (t - 1)`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` iterations mean `t` `result`s are appended to `results`.
- `index` will be `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` (not applicable as the loop has finished); `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be 0; `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`; `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`; `n` is not applicable as the loop has finished; `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished.**

In human-readable terms:
- The loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- `results` contains `t` results, each computed from a different array.
- `index` points to the position right after the last array processed.
- `t` is now 0, as all iterations have been completed.
