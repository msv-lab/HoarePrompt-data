Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). 

The logic is based on the observation that the number of operations needed is determined by the larger of two values:
1. The number of cats that need to be added to boxes that are currently empty but should contain a cat (`cats_to_add`).
2. The number of cats that need to be removed from boxes that are currently occupied but should be empty (`cats_to_remove`).

This is because any cat moved from one box to another can be considered as a combination of a removal and an addition, and thus the limiting factor is the larger of these two counts. Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly computes the minimum number of operations needed for each test case.
