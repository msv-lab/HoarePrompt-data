Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the new string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to the new string input by the user. The values of `a`, `b`, and the condition regarding the sum of `a` and `b` remain dependent on the new value of `s`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
