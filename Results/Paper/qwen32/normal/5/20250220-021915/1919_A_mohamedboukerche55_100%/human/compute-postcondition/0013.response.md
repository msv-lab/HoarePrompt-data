The code snippet `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` splits the string `s` by whitespace, converts the second element of the resulting list to an integer, and assigns it to `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `b` is already the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s`, the value of `b` does not change after the execution of this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the new string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 4.**
