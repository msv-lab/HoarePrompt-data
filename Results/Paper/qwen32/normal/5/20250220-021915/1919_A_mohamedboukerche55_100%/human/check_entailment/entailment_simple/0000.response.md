### Reasoning:

The game described can be analyzed using game theory. The key insight is that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b).

Here's the reasoning broken down:

1. **Initial State**: Alice and Bob have `a` and `b` coins respectively.
2. **Turns**: Each player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses.

The critical observation is that the game can be reduced to the parity of the sum of coins `a + b`:

- **Even Sum (a + b is even)**: If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because after Alice's first move, the number of coins will become odd, and Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one who faces a situation where no valid move is possible.
  
- **Odd Sum (a + b is odd)**: If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally. This is because after Alice's first move, the number of coins will become even, and Alice can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that Bob is the one who faces a situation where no valid move is possible.

The provided code correctly implements this logic by checking if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` to determine the winner. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis of the game's mechanics.

**Correctness: True**
