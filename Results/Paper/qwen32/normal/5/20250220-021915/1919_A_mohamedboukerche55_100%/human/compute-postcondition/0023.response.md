Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the new string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 5. The program does not modify `t`, `s`, `a`, `b`, or `i` based on the condition.**
