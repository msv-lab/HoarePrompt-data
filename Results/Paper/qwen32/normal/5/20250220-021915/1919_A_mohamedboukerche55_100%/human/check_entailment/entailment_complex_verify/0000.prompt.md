You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; all t test cases have been processed; for each test case, the program has read a string `s`, split it to get integers `a` and `b`, and printed 'Bob' if (a + b) is even, otherwise printed 'Alice'; i is equal to t.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this logic does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the test case:
```
1
1 2
```
According to the program, the sum of the coins is 3 (odd), so it would print "Alice". However, let's analyze the optimal moves:

1. Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
2. Alice cannot swap wallets because she would then have 2 coins and Bob 1, and removing a coin from her wallet would leave her with 0 coins, making Bob win immediately.
3. Alice does not swap and removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, Alice has 0 coins and Bob has 2 coins.
4. Bob cannot swap wallets because Alice's wallet is already empty.
5. Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 1 coin.
6. Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.
7. Bob is left with 1 coin and removes it, making both wallets empty.
8. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Thus, the correct output for the test case `1 2` should be "Alice", not "Bob". Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Another example to consider:
```
1
2 1
```
The program would print "Bob" because the sum is 3 (odd). However, let's analyze the optimal moves:

1. Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice swaps wallets, so now Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 2 coins.
3. Bob cannot swap wallets because Alice's wallet is already empty.
4. Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 1 coin.
5. Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.
6. Bob is left with 1 coin and removes it, making both wallets empty.
7. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Thus, the correct output for the test case `2 1` should be "Alice", not "Bob". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
