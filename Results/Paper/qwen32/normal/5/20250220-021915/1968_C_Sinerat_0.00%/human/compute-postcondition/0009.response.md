The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` must remain greater than 1, and since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

The variables `t`, `x`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 3; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, and the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`; `i` is 3**
