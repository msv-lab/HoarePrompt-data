The given code snippet updates the list `a` at index `i` by setting it to the sum of the previous element in `a` and the element at index `i-1` in `x`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500. 

Given the code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, the value of `a[i]` will be updated based on the previous value of `a` and the corresponding value in `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the i-th element (for i > 0) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`.**

In simpler terms, the first element of `a` remains 500, and each subsequent element of `a` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
