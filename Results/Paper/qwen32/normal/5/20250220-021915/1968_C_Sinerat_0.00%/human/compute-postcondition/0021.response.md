The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` by setting it to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `a[2]` is updated to `a[1] + x[1]`. Since `a[1]` is `500 + x[0]`, the new value of `a[2]` becomes `(500 + x[0]) + x[1]`, which simplifies to `500 + x[0] + x[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500, the second element set to `500 + x[0]`, and the third element set to `500 + x[0] + x[1]`; `i` is 2**.
