Output State: **`t` is a single integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from `a` and its value is the count of how many times that length appears in `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will contain the frequency of each stick length in the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
