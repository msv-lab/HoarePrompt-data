You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it calculates how many sets of three sticks can be formed from the sticks of the same length and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, with each side of a polygon being formed by exactly one stick. However, there are a few issues with the logic implemented in the program:

1. **Polygon Formation Requirement**: A regular polygon must have at least 3 sides. The program currently divides the count of each stick length by 3, which would only work if all polygons were triangles. However, the problem allows for polygons with any number of sides, not just triangles.

2. **Efficient Counting of Polygons**: The program does not consider polygons with more than 3 sides. For example, if there are 6 sticks of the same length, the program would count only 2 triangles (6 // 3), but it could form 1 hexagon (6 // 6). The program should check for the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length, starting from polygons with 3 sides up to the maximum possible number of sides (which is the count of sticks of that length).

3. **Logic Implementation**: The function `func_1()` should be correctly implemented to count the maximum number of polygons for each stick length. This involves iterating over possible polygon side counts and checking how many polygons can be formed for each stick length.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
