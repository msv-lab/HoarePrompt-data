Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a single integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from `a` and its value is the count of how many times that length appears in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a single integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `ans` is `x // 3`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a single integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `ans` is `x_next // 3 + x // 3`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()` that has not been used yet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a single integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `ans` is `x_next // 3 + 2 * (x // 3)`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()` that has not been used yet.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
