### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code in detail.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to its MEX (minimum excludant) value.
- The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- The operations are performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times, but the number of operations is not minimized.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- The code reads an integer `n` (length of the array) and a list of integers `a`.
- The array `a` is populated with string values instead of integers.
- The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `n`.
- Inside `func_1`, if `n` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
- For any other length, it prints `13 0`.
- The function does not compute the MEX or perform any operations on the array to maximize the sum.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The array `a` is not converted to integers, which will cause issues when performing arithmetic operations.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases:
     - When the length of the array is 2, it outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which is correct only for the specific case `[0, 1]`.
     - For any other length, it outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect for most cases.
   
3. **Lack of Generalization**:
   - The function does not generalize to all possible inputs. It does not compute the MEX for any subarray or perform operations to maximize the sum.

#### Verification Against Function Summary:
- The function summary states that `func_1` handles specific cases based on the length of the array but does not compute the MEX or perform operations to maximize the sum.
- This aligns with the code's behavior, which only handles two specific cases and does not generalize.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- For the input `4 1 2 3 4`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect.
- The correct output should involve setting subarrays to their respective MEX values to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the allowed operations. It only handles two specific cases and does not generalize to all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
