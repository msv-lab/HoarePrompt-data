The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is a formatted string that directly contains the values '13' and '0'. The initial state provides information about the variables `c` and `m`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of `c` and `m` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print(f'13 0')`.
2. The `f` before the string indicates that it is an f-string, but in this case, there are no variables within the curly braces `{}` that would be replaced with their values.
3. The string inside the `print` statement is `'13 0'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'13 0'`.

Output: **13 0**
