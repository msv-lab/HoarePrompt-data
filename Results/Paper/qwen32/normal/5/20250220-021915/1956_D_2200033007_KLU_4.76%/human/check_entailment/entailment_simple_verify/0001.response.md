Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the input but does not convert the elements of the list `na` from strings to integers. This will cause issues when trying to perform operations that require numerical computations on the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Logic for Computing MEX:** The program does not compute the MEX (minimum excludant) or perform the operations described in the problem. Instead, it has hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array. Specifically:
   - If the length of the array is 2, it outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which is correct only for the specific case where the array is `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`.
   - For any other length, it outputs `13 0`, which is not a general solution and is incorrect for most cases.

3. **Handling Different Cases:** The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2). It does not provide a general solution for arrays of length 1 to 18. It fails to consider the actual values in the array and the operations needed to maximize the sum.

4. **Output:** The program does not compute the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the operations. It just prints hardcoded values, which are not necessarily correct for all inputs.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to consider the actual values in the array and the operations needed to maximize the sum.

Final: **False**
