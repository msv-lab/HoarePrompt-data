Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input correctly and converts the string input into a list of strings. However, it does not convert these strings into integers, which is a crucial step for processing the array elements.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the maximum sum of the array after performing the allowed operations and output the sequence of operations. However, the function only checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints a hardcoded result. If the length is not 2, it prints another hardcoded result. This approach does not consider the actual values of the array elements and does not perform any operations to maximize the sum.

3. **Handling Different Cases**: The problem requires different strategies for different input cases. The program does not handle any cases correctly except for the very specific case of an array of length 2, and even then, it does not compute the MEX value correctly or perform the required operations.

4. **Output**: The program prints a fixed output for specific conditions without considering the actual input values. This is incorrect because the maximum sum and the sequence of operations depend on the actual values in the array.

5. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution that works for all possible inputs within the given constraints. It fails to implement the logic to compute the MEX value for any subarray and update the array accordingly.

Given these points, the program is clearly incorrect as it does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
