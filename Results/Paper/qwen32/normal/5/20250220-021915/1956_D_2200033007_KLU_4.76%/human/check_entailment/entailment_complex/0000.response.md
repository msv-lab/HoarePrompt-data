Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program checks if the length of the list `c` is 2 and prints a fixed output of `4 1` followed by `1 2`, which is only correct for the specific case where the input array is `[0, 1]`. For all other cases, it incorrectly prints `13 0`, which is only correct for the input `[1, 3, 9]`. The program does not implement any logic to calculate the MEX or to perform the operations described in the problem statement to maximize the sum of the array. It also does not handle the general case of any array input as described in the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not provide the correct output for all possible valid inputs as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
