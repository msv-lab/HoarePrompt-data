### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input and converts it into a list of strings (`na`), but it does not convert these strings to integers. As a result, any operations that assume the elements of `a` are integers will fail. This is indeed a critical issue because the problem requires arithmetic operations on the array elements.

2. **Logic for Computing MEX:**
   - The program does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the operations described in the problem statement. Instead, it prints hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array. This is incorrect because the MEX operation is crucial for maximizing the sum of the array. The program does not attempt to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in any subarray and update the subarray accordingly.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2. It does not provide a general solution for arrays of length 1 to 18. This is a significant limitation because the problem requires a solution that works for any valid input within the given constraints.

4. **Output:**
   - The program does not compute the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the operations. Instead, it prints hardcoded values, which are not necessarily correct for all inputs. For example, the output `4 1` and `1 2` for an array of length 2 is only correct for the specific example `[0, 1]`. For other arrays of length 2, the correct output might differ.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary provided does not match the actual behavior of the function `func_1`. The summary suggests that the function prints specific lines based on whether the list `c` contains exactly one element with the value 2, which is not the case. The function actually prints hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to parse the input correctly, does not perform the required operations to compute the MEX, and does not provide a general solution for all possible inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
