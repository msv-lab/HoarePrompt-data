### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking the length of the array `c` and printing predefined outputs based on that length. However, this approach is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Array Values**: The program does not consider the actual values in the array. It only checks the length of the array and prints fixed outputs based on that length. This is insufficient to determine the maximum sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.

2. **Fixed Outputs**: The program prints fixed outputs for specific lengths of the array:
   - If the length is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - For all other lengths, it prints `13 0`.

   These outputs do not reflect the actual maximum sum that can be achieved for different arrays. For example, the array `[1, 3, 9]` should result in `13 0` (since no operations are needed), but the program correctly handles this case. However, for the array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the program should output `105 2` with specific operations, which it does not.

3. **Lack of General Solution**: The program does not implement a general algorithm to find the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. It only handles specific cases and does not consider the full range of possible inputs.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct for all possible inputs. It fails to implement a general solution to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations.

**Correctness: False**
