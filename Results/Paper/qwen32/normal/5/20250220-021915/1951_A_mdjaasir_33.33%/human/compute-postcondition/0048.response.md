Output State: **i is equal to t, start and end are non-negative integers such that start <= end, t is an input integer, and the loop has finished executing all iterations.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The input integer `t` also remains unchanged as it determines the number of iterations the loop should perform.
