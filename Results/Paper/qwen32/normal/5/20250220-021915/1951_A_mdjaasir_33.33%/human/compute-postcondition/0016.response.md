Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, and `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. Additionally, `count` is equal to 2. The first occurrence of '1' in `a` is either not immediately followed by another '1' or is at the last position of the string.**
