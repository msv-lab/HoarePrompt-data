Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Bob is selling buns with a usual price `a` and a special promotion price that starts from `b` and goes down to `b - k + 1` for the first `k` buns. We need to find the maximum possible profit by choosing an optimal `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).

### Key Observations

1. **Choosing `k`**:
    - When `b <= a`, it's always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the promotion price is not beneficial.
    - When `b > a`, we need to sell the first `k` buns at the promotion price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

2. **Maximizing Profit**:
    - The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and ending at `b - k + 1`.
    - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
    - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Optimal `k`**:
    - The optimal `k` is the maximum possible value that keeps the promotion price non-negative, i.e., `b - k + 1 >= 0` or `k <= b`.
    - Additionally, `k` should not exceed `n` because we can't sell more buns than we have.
    - Therefore, `k` should be `min(n, b)`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

1. **Reading Input**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
    - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculating `k`**:
    - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. However, this is incorrect. `k` should be `min(n, b)` because we are interested in the maximum possible number of buns we can sell at the promotion price without making the price negative.

3. **Calculating Profit**:
    - If `b <= a`, the program correctly calculates the total profit as `a * n`.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and adds the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns.

### Conclusion

The program incorrectly calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)` instead of `min(n, b)`. This could lead to suboptimal results in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
