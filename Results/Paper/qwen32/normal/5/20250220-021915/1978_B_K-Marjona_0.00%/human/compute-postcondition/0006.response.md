Let's break down the given code and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. Additionally, `b` is greater than `a`.

### Code to be executed:
```python
print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Understanding `k`**: 
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This means `k` will be the smaller of the two values.
   
2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression consists of two main parts:
     1. `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`
     2. `(n - k) * a`
   - Let's analyze each part separately:
     1. **First Part: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`**
        - This part calculates the sum of the `k` largest numbers in the range from `a` to `b` (inclusive).
        - `b - k + 1` gives the starting point of the `k` largest numbers in the range.
        - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: `sum = (first_term + last_term) * number_of_terms / 2`.
        - Here, `first_term` is `b - k + 1`, `last_term` is `b`, and `number_of_terms` is `k`.
        - Therefore, `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` calculates the sum of the `k` largest numbers in the range.
     2. **Second Part: `(n - k) * a`**
        - This part calculates the sum of the remaining `n - k` numbers, all of which are `a`.
        - Since there are `n - k` such numbers, the sum is `(n - k) * a`.

3. **Combining the Parts**:
   - The total sum is the sum of the `k` largest numbers plus the sum of the remaining `n - k` numbers, all of which are `a`.

### Final Expression:
The expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a` calculates the total sum based on the given conditions.

### Output:
Output: **(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a)**

This output represents the calculated value based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet.
