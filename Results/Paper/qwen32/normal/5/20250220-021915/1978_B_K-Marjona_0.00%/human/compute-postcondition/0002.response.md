Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

In simple terms, the variable `k` is now assigned the value of the smaller number between `n` and `b - a`. All other variables retain their initial states.
