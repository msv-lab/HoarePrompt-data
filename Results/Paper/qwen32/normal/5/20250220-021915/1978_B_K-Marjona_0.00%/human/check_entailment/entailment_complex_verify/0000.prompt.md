You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each of the following t test cases consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: t is 0; all test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy all buns for each of the given test cases, considering a special price for the first bun in each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The program is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Handling the case when `b <= a`:**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The code correctly handles this case by printing `a * n`.

2. **Handling the case when `b > a`:**
   - The goal is to maximize profit by choosing an optimal `k` such that the first `k` buns are sold at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The code sets `k = min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable approach since selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would not be beneficial because the price would drop to zero or below.
   - The formula for the profit when `b > a` is `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`. This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.

### Potential Issues:
- The formula for calculating the sum of the arithmetic series might be incorrect. The sum of the series from `b` to `b - k + 1` should be `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2`.
- The code uses integer division `//` which is correct for summing the series, but we need to ensure the order of operations is correct.
