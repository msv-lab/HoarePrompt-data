### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, given a promotion where the first `k` buns can be sold at a modified price. The modified price for the `i-th` bun in the first `k` buns is `(b - i + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

The given program iterates through each test case, calculates the optimal `k`, and computes the total profit based on this `k`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are read.

2. **Determine Optimal `k`:**
   - The value of `k` is determined as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the difference between `b` and `a`.

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means the promotion price is not beneficial, and all buns should be sold at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
     - The sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns, which is the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`. This sum can be computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`.
     - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The computed profit for each test case is printed.

### Verification Against Example:

- **First Test Case (n=4, a=4, b=5):**
  - `k = min(4, 5-4) = 1`
  - Profit = `(5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) // 2 * 1 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`

- **Second Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=9):**
  - `k = min(5, 9-5) = 4`
  - Profit = `(9 + (9 - 4 + 1)) // 2 * 4 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 35`

- **Third Test Case (n=10, a=10, b=5):**
  - `k = min(10, 5-10) = 0`
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`

- **Fourth Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=11):**
  - `k = min(5, 11-5) = 5`
  - Profit = `(11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45`

- **Fifth Test Case (n=10^9, a=10^9, b=10^9):**
  - `k = min(10^9, 10^9-10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9`

- **Sixth Test Case (n=10^9, a=10^9, b=1):**
  - `k = min(10^9, 1-10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9`

- **Seventh Test Case (n=1000, a=1, b=1000):**
  - `k = min(1000, 1000-1) = 999`
  - Profit = `(1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1)) // 2 * 999 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 500500`

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for all provided test cases.
