To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step by step based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but `t` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore this.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are provided values.
- `k` is defined as `min(n, b - a)`.

### Expression Breakdown:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a
```

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate `k`**:
   - `k = min(n, b - a)`

2. **Calculate the first part of the expression**:
   - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`
     - This part calculates the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and ending at `b - k + 1`.
     - The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:
       \[
       \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
       \]
     - Here, the number of terms is `k`, the first term is `b`, and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
     - So, the sum of the series is:
       \[
       \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1)) = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1)
       \]
     - Simplifying further:
       \[
       \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1) = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
       \]

3. **Calculate the second part of the expression**:
   - `(n - k) * a`

4. **Combine both parts**:
   - The final expression is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}\right) + (n - k) \times a
     \]

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of the expression calculated above.

Output: **\(\left(\frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}\right) + (n - k) \times a\) (where \(k = \min(n, b - a)\))**
