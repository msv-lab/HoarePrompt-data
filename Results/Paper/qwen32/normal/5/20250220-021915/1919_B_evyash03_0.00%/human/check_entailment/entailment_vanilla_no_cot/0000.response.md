Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array. The provided function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not consider the absolute value of the sum of each subarray and its length when calculating the penalty. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the balance is positive at the end, which is not the correct approach.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to implement a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that efficiently calculates the minimum penalty by considering the optimal way to split the array based on the given rules.
