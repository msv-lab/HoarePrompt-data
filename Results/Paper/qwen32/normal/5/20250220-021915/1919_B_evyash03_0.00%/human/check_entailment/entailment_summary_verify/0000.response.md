### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. Let's break down the issues with the program and the function `func_1`:

1. **Function Purpose and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is described as counting the number of times the running balance becomes negative and adding 1 if the final balance is positive.
   - This logic does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the sum of penalties of the subarrays. The penalty calculation involves the absolute value of the sum of a subarray multiplied by its length, which is not captured by the provided function.

2. **Counterexample**:
   - The provided counterexample with the input `+-++--` illustrates that the function does not yield the minimum penalty.
   - The optimal split for this input is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`, whereas the function would likely produce a higher penalty.

3. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves splitting the array into subarrays where the sum of each subarray is zero, as this would minimize the penalty.
   - The function `func_1` does not attempt to find such splits; instead, it simply counts balance transitions, which is insufficient for minimizing the penalty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum penalty for splitting the array `a`. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
