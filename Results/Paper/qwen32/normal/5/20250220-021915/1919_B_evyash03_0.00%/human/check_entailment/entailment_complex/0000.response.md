### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The strategy used in the code involves iterating through the string and maintaining a running balance of the number of '+' and '-' characters. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `s` is split by the character '-', which results in parts consisting of '+' characters. The length of these parts is summed up to `result_length`. However, this `result_length` is not directly used in the function `func_1` and seems to be a leftover or incorrectly included part of the code.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each character of the string `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` that is incremented by 1 for each '+' and decremented by 1 for each '-'.
   - If at any point the `balance` becomes negative, it increments a `count` and resets the `balance` to 0. This signifies that a split is necessary to avoid a negative balance, and the count reflects the number of such splits.
   - After the loop, it checks if the final `balance` is positive. If it is, it adds 1 to the `count`. This is because a positive balance at the end means that the remaining part of the array contributes to the penalty, and thus, it needs to be considered as an additional segment.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The core idea of the function `func_1` is correct. It ensures that the running balance never goes negative by counting the necessary splits. Additionally, it accounts for any remaining positive balance at the end.
   - The function `func_1` effectively calculates the minimum penalty by counting the necessary splits and considering the final balance.

4. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The variable `result_length` is calculated but not used in the function `func_1`. This variable seems unnecessary for the current implementation.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum penalty by counting the necessary splits and considering the final balance. The unnecessary calculation of `result_length` does not affect the correctness of the solution.

**Correctness: True**
