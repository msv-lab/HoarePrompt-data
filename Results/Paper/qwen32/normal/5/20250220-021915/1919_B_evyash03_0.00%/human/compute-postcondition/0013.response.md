Postcondition: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. If `balance` is less than 0, then `count` is set to 1 and `balance` is set to 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value.**
