### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Understanding

The task is to split the given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy involves splitting the array in such a way that the subarrays have a sum of zero, as this would minimize their penalties.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Initial Splitting Attempt:**
   - The program attempts to split the string `s` using the `split('-')` method. This method splits the string at every occurrence of the character `'-'`, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem. This step does not contribute to finding the optimal splits.

3. **Counting Balance:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`.
   - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - Whenever the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - After the loop, it adds 1 to `count` if the `balance` is greater than 0.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

#### Function Summary

The function evaluates a string of '+' and '-' characters, counting the number of times a running balance becomes negative, resetting it to zero each time. It also checks if the final balance is positive. The result is the count of resets plus one if the final balance is positive, otherwise just the count.

#### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Splitting Approach:**
  - The initial splitting using `split('-')` is not relevant to finding the optimal subarrays.
  
- **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This does not account for the actual penalties of the subarrays.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, one needs to find a way to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero, or as close to zero as possible. This involves a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach that keeps track of the balance and splits the array optimally.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program, it is clear that it does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not account for the actual penalties of the subarrays and only counts the number of times the balance goes negative, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum penalty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
