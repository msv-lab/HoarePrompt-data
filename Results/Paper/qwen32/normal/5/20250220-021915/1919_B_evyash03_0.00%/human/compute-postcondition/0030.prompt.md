Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `expression` is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000; `count` is 0; `balance` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for char in expression:
    if char == '+':
        balance += 1
    elif char == '-':
        balance -= 1
    if balance < 0:
        count += 1
        balance = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. If `balance` is less than 0, then `count` is set to 1 and `balance` is set to 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. `char` is the next character in `expression`. If `balance` is less than 0, then `count` is 0 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` retains its original value and `balance` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in `expression`. If `balance` was originally less than 0, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `balance` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `char` is '+', `balance` is incremented by 1. If `char` is '-', `balance` is decremented by 1. If `char` is neither '+' nor '-', `count` and `balance` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
