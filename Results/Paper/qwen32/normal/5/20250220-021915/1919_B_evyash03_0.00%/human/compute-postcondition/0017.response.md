Postcondition: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in `expression`. If `char` is '-', and `balance` was originally 0 or positive, `count` is set to 1 and `balance` is set to 0. If `char` is '-' and `balance` was already negative, `balance` is decreased by 1 and `count` remains 0. If `char` is not '-', `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value.**
