Output State: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `count` is 1, and `balance` is -1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, and `balance`) remain unchanged.
