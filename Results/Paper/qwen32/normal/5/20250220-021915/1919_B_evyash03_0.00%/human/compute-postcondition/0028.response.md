The code provided sets the variable `balance` to 0. The values of `expression`, `length`, `char`, `count`, and the original value of `balance` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in `expression`. If `char` is '+', and `balance` was less than 0, then `count` is 0 and `balance` is 0; otherwise, `count` retains its original value and `balance` is `balance + 1`. If `char` is '-', and `balance` was originally less than 0, then `count` is 0 and `balance` is 0. If `char` is '-', and `balance` was originally 0 or more, then `count` retains its original value and `balance` is `original_balance - 1`. If `char` is neither '+' nor '-', `count` and `balance` retain their original values. `count` is incremented by 1. `balance` is 0.**
