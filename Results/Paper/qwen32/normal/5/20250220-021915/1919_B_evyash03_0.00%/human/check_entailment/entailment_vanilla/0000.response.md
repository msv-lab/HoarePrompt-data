Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The given problem requires us to split the array derived from the string `s` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string itself `s`.

2. **Incorrect Approach**:
   - The program attempts to split the string by the character `'-'` and calculates the sum of lengths of the resulting parts.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Splitting by `'-'` only considers one character and does not account for the actual balance of `+` and `-` in the subarrays.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function iterates over the string and keeps a running balance of `+` and `-`.
   - It increments a counter `count` whenever the balance becomes negative, indicating a subarray that ends with a negative balance.
   - It also adds `1` to the result if the final balance is positive, indicating that the last subarray has a positive balance.
   - This approach is trying to count the number of subarrays needed to ensure that the sum of each subarray is non-negative, which is not the optimal strategy to minimize the total penalty.

### Correct Approach

The correct strategy to minimize the penalty involves:
- Iterating through the string while maintaining a running balance.
- Whenever the balance becomes zero, it indicates a subarray with zero penalty.
- If the balance is non-zero at the end of the string, it indicates a subarray with a non-zero penalty, which needs to be considered.

However, the provided program does not implement this strategy correctly. It only counts the number of subarrays with a negative balance and adds one if the final balance is positive, which does not necessarily minimize the total penalty.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement an optimal strategy to minimize the total penalty.

**Correctness: False**
