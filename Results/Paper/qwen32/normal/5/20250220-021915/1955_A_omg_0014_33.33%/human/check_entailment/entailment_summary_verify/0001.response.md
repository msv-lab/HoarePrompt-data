### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program has several issues:
1. **Variable Misuse**: The program reads `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, but `c` should be `b` as per the problem description. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem statement.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price.
3. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually (`n * a`) and the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price plus the cost of any remaining yogurt (`(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`).

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts individually
        individual_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price
        pair_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(individual_cost, pair_cost))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

#### Original Program Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Original Program:
1. **Variable `c` Misused**: The variable `c` should be `b` as per the problem statement.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation `d = c / 2` is incorrect.
3. **Incorrect Comparison**: The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the misuse of variables and incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
