The given Python code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state provides information about `t` and the subsequent lines containing `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the provided code only reads a single integer input and assigns it to `n`, without processing the rest of the input lines.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` and retain the unchanged information about `t` and the subsequent lines of input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.**
