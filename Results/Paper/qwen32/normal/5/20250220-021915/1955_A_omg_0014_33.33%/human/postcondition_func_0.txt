The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * (c / 2))`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * (c / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, as its output is through print statements.
