Reasoning:  
The provided program contains a logical error in calculating the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues and the correct approach:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logical Error**: 
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2` which is incorrect. The variable `c` is not defined in the code. It seems like the intention was to use `b` instead of `c` (the price for two yogurts on promotion).
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is also incorrect. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually (`a * n`) and the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price plus the cost of any remaining yogurt at the regular price.
   - The program does not correctly account for the number of yogurts `n` in its calculations.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price: `pairs = n // 2`.
   - Calculate the number of remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
   - The total cost is then `total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a`.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost based on the number of yogurts `n` and the promotion price `b`.

Correctness: **False**
