To determine the output of the `print(a * b)` statement, we need to focus on the variables `a` and `b` as described in the initial state. The initial state provides the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
- `d` is `c / 2`.
- `i` is 4.

The value of `a * b` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, which are provided by the input. Since the specific values of `a` and `b` are not explicitly given in the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `a * b`. However, we can describe the output based on the information provided.

The `print(a * b)` statement will output the product of `a` and `b`.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers provided by the input)**
