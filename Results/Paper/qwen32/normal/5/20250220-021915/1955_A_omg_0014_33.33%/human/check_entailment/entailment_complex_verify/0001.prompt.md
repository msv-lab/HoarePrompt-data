You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer; `i` is equal to `n` (indicating the loop has finished); `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers provided by the input; `d` is `c / 2`; the loop has printed `n` values, each being either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the comparison condition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * (c / 2))`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * (c / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, as its output is through print statements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. We have two options:
1. Buy each yogurt individually at a price of `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts at a promotional price of `b` burles.

The goal is to minimize the total cost.

### Program Analysis
Let's walk through the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Variable Misuse**: In the input parsing, the program expects three integers `(a, b, c)`, but the problem statement describes the inputs as `(n, a, b)`. Here, `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The variable `c` is not used correctly and should be `b`.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price.
3. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually (`n * a`) and the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price plus the cost of any remaining yogurt (`(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`).

### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts individually
        individual_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price
        pair_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(individual_cost, pair_cost))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the misuse of variables and incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost.
