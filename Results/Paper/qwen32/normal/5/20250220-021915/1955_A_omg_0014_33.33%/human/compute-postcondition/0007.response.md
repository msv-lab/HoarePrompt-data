To determine the output of the `print(round(a * d))` statement, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the value of `d`:**
   - `d` is defined as `c / 2`. Since `c` is an integer, `c / 2` will be a float. However, if `c` is an even integer, `c / 2` will be an integer value.

2. **Calculate `a * d`:**
   - `a * d` will be `a * (c / 2)`. This is essentially half of `a * c`.

3. **Apply the `round` function:**
   - The `round` function rounds the result of `a * d` to the nearest integer.

Given the precondition `a * b >= a * d`, we know that `b >= d` or equivalently `b >= c / 2`. This inequality doesn't directly affect the calculation of `round(a * d)`, but it provides context about the relationship between `b` and `d`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `round(a * d)`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output Description:**

The `print(round(a * d))` statement will print the rounded value of `a * (c / 2)`. Since `d` is `c / 2`, the expression `a * d` is `a * (c / 2)`. The `round` function will round this value to the nearest integer.

Output: **round(a * (c / 2)) (where a, c are integers)**
