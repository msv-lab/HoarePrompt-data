Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in how it calculates the minimum cost for buying the yogurts. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Variable Mismatch**: The input variables are `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price for two yogurts. However, in the code, the variables are named `(a, b, c)`. This is incorrect because `c` does not exist in the input description.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is incorrect. The variable `c` should be `b` (the price for two yogurts), so it should be `b / 2`. But this calculation is not even needed for the correct solution.

3. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct logic should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price versus the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the number of single yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price
        singles = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, calculates the minimum cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
