### Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program `func_1` only considers forming triangles (3-sided polygons) by calculating the sum of integer divisions of the frequency of each stick length by 3. This approach is insufficient because it does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides, such as squares, pentagons, hexagons, etc.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should consider all possible regular polygons that can be formed with the given sticks. This involves checking for each unique stick length how many polygons (with sides ranging from 3 upwards) can be formed using the available sticks of that length.

For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 3, the program should consider forming:
- 2 triangles (3 sticks per triangle)
- 1 square (4 sticks per square)
- 0 pentagons (5 sticks per pentagon)
- 0 hexagons (6 sticks per hexagon)

And similarly for other stick lengths. The program should iterate through possible polygon side lengths and determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

Since the current program only checks for triangles, it will not correctly determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed in many cases. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final: **False**
