You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks in the test case, and the next n elements are integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element `n` represents the number of sticks in the test case, and the next `n` elements are integers representing the lengths of the sticks; `freq` is a dictionary with each unique number of sticks `n` as keys and their respective counts as values across all test cases.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap
- We need to form the maximum number of regular polygons using the given sticks.
- Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick.
- No stick can be used in more than one polygon.
- The number of sides of the polygon can vary, but all sides must be of equal length.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and the list of stick lengths (`arr`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then calculates the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3 (`v // 3` for each `v` in `freq.values()`).

3. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The function assumes that each regular polygon must have exactly 3 sides (triangles).
   - This is incorrect because regular polygons can have more than 3 sides (e.g., squares, pentagons, hexagons, etc.).
   - The program does not consider polygons with more than 3 sides, which means it might not be able to form polygons with 4, 5, or more sides even if the sticks allow it.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it only considers the formation of triangles (3-sided polygons) and does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with 4 or more sides. Therefore, it might not return the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

### Correctness: **False**
