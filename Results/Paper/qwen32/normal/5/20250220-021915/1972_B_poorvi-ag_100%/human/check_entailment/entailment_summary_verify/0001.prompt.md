You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If it is, the function outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The problem can be analyzed by focusing on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Game Dynamics and Parity**: 
   - Each operation involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. 
   - If the adjacent coins were both facing down, they will both become facing up, increasing the count of facing-up coins by 2 (which does not change the parity).
   - If one adjacent coin was facing up and the other facing down, the facing-up coin will become facing down, and the facing-down coin will become facing up, leaving the count of facing-up coins unchanged (parity remains the same).
   - If both adjacent coins were facing up, they will both become facing down, decreasing the count of facing-up coins by 2 (which does not change the parity).

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left. The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - For Alice to win, she must be the one to make the last move, leaving Bob with no facing-up coins.
   - Therefore, if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always leave Bob with an even number of facing-up coins after her turn, and eventually, Bob will be the one to face a situation with no facing-up coins left.
   - Conversely, if the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is the one to face a situation with no facing-up coins left.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The key observation is that the parity of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the number of 'U's in the input string for each test case and appending 'yes' or 'no' to the results list based on whether the count is odd or even, respectively.
