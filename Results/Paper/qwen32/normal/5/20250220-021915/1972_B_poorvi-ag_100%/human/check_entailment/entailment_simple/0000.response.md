### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins. The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U"). Specifically, if the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the coins' states.

2. **Winning Condition Determination:**
   - The program checks whether the count of "U" in the string `arr` is odd or even using `arr.count('U') % 2`.
   - If the count is odd (`arr.count('U') % 2 == 1`), it appends `'yes'` to the `results` list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the count is even, it appends `'no'` to the `results` list, indicating that Bob will win.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

The logic is based on the observation that each move flips two adjacent coins, and the parity of the number of "U" coins will determine who can force a win. If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of "U" coins for Bob, and vice versa.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins. The provided example and the explanation align with the program's behavior.

**Correctness: True**
