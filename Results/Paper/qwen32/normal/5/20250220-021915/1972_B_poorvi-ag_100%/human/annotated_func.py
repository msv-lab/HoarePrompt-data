#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even, `i` is `t-1`, `arr` is the string provided by the user input for the last test case.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case, `results` is a non-empty list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even, `arr` is the string provided by the user input for the last test case, and all elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If it is, the function outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".
