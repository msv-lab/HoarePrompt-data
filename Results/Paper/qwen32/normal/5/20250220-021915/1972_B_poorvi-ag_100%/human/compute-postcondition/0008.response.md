The code snippet appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The count of 'U' in `arr` is still even.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`, `i` is 0, `arr` is the string provided by the user input, and the count of 'U' in `arr` is even.**
