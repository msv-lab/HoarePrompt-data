The code snippet `arr = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is the string provided by the user input.**
