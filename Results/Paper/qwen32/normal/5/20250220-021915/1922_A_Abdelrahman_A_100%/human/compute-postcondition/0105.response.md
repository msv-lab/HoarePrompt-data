Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if a given string `c` is neither equal to strings `a` nor `b` and if each character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b` at the corresponding position. It prints 'NO' if these conditions are met for all characters in `c`, otherwise, it prints 'YES'.**
