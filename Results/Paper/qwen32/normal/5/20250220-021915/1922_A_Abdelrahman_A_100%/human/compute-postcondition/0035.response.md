Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an input value; if `no` is `True`, then `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and every element `x` in `c` was found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]` with `counter` equal to the length of `c`. If `no` is `False`, the conditions regarding `c`, `a`, `b`, and `counter` remain as described in the precondition.**
