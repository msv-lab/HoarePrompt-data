Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an input value; `no` is True; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `counter` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an iterable with at least one element; `no` is False if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, otherwise `no` remains True; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `counter` is 1. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an iterable with at least two elements; `no` is False if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, otherwise `no` remains True; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `counter` is 2; `x` is the second element in `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is set to False. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an iterable with at least two elements; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `counter` is 3; `x` is the third element in `c`. If `x` is not in `a[3]` and `x` is not in `b[3]`, then `no` is set to False. Otherwise, `no` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
