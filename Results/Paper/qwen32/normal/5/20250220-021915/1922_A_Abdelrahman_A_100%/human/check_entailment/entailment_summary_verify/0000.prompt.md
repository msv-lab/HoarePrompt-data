You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if a given string `c` is neither equal to strings `a` nor `b` and if each character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b` at the corresponding position. It prints 'NO' if these conditions are met for all characters in `c`, otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints "NO". While this is a valid check, it does not cover all scenarios where a valid template `t` does not exist.

2. The program then iterates through each character of `c` and checks if the character is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. This logic is flawed because it checks for the presence of the character in `a` and `b` rather than ensuring that the template conditions are met.

Here is a specific counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
aaa
bbb
aab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
A valid template `t` could be "AAB". Here:
- The first letter of `a` and `b` differ from 'A' (lowercase 'a' and 'b' are different from 'A').
- The second letter of `a` and `b` differ from 'A' (lowercase 'a' and 'b' are different from 'A').
- The third letter of `a` and `b` match 'B' (lowercase 'a' and 'b' are different from 'B').
- The first letter of `c` matches 'A' (lowercase 'a' is the same as 'A').
- The second letter of `c` matches 'A' (lowercase 'a' is the same as 'A').
- The third letter of `c` does not match 'B' (lowercase 'b' is different from 'B').

Thus, the template "AAB" satisfies the conditions, and the output should be "YES".

**Program Output:**
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it fails to correctly evaluate the template conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
