The code snippet provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases to be processed. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`tests` is an integer read from input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
