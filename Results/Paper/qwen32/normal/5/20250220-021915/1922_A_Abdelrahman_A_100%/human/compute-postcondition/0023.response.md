Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an iterable with at least two elements; `no` is False if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, otherwise `no` remains True; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `counter` is 1; `x` is the second element in `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is set to False. Otherwise, `no` remains True.**
