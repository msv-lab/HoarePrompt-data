Postcondition: ***`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value from `input()`; `i` is the current iteration index + 2; `no` is False if `c` equals `a` or `b`, otherwise `no` is True or False depending on whether any `x` in `c` was not in `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`; `counter` is equal to the length of `c`.***
