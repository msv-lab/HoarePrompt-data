To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `sequence` list based on the initial values of `size` and `overlap`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(size - overlap):
    sequence.append(i + overlap)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - If `number` is 62 or greater, `size` is 6 and `overlap` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `size` and `overlap` are the first valid (size, i) pair found.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `size - overlap` times.
   - In each iteration, it appends `i + overlap` to the `sequence` list.

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `sequence` has one element equal to `0 + overlap`.
- After 2 iterations: `sequence` has two elements equal to `0 + overlap` and `1 + overlap`.
- After 3 iterations: `sequence` has three elements equal to `0 + overlap`, `1 + overlap`, and `2 + overlap`.

### Generalizing:
- After `n` iterations, `sequence` will have `n` elements, each element being `i + overlap` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

### Total Iterations:
- The loop runs `size - overlap` times.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `sequence` will have `size - overlap` elements.

### Final Output State:
- `sequence` will contain elements from `overlap` to `size - 1`.

### Calculation:
- If `size` is 6 and `overlap` is 1 (as per the condition that `number` is 62 or greater):
  - The loop runs `6 - 1 = 5` times.
  - `sequence` will have elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].**

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `sequence` list will contain the numbers from `overlap` to `size - 1`, which in this case are the numbers from 1 to 5.
