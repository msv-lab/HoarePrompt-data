Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer such that 2 <= `number` <= 10^18, and `sequence`, a list of integers representing an array. The length of `sequence` should be at most 200 if it satisfies the condition of having exactly `number` increasing subsequences. If no such sequence exists, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns (0, 0).**
