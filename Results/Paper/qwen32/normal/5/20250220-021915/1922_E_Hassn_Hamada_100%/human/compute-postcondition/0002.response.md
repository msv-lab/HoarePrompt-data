Output State: **The program returns (0, 0)**

Here, the program explicitly returns the tuple (0, 0) regardless of the initial state of `number` and `sequence`. The value of `number` being 0 and `sequence` being an empty list does not affect the return statement, as the return statement is hardcoded to return (0, 0).
