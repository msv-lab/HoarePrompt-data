The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range generated by `size - overlap`. To ensure the loop executes, `size - overlap` must be greater than 0. This means `size` must be greater than `overlap`.

Given the conditions:
- If `number` is 62 or greater, `size` is 6 and `overlap` is 1.
- Otherwise, `size` and `overlap` are the first valid (size, overlap) pair found.

We need to ensure that `size - overlap` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since the exact value of `size` and `overlap` depends on the value of `number`, we must consider both cases:

1. If `number` is 62 or greater:
   - `size` is 6.
   - `overlap` is 1.
   - `size - overlap` is 5, which is greater than 0.

2. If `number` is less than 62:
   - `size` and `overlap` are the first valid pair found.
   - We need to ensure that `size - overlap` is greater than 0.

Since the exact values of `size` and `overlap` when `number` is less than 62 are not specified, we can only ensure that `size` is greater than `overlap` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `size` is greater than `overlap`.

State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`**
