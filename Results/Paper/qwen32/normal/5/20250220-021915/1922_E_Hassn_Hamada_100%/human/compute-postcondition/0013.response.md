To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition: `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `1 << size + 1` is equivalent to `2^(size + 1)`.
- `1 << i` is equivalent to `2^i`.
- The loop condition is `2^(size + 1) - 2^i <= number`.

Given the current state:
- `number` must be at least 7.
- `size` is 3.
- `i` is 0.

Let's substitute the values of `size` and `i` into the loop condition:
- `2^(3 + 1) - 2^0 = 2^4 - 2^0 = 16 - 1 = 15`.

So, the condition becomes `15 <= number`. Since `number` must be at least 7, we need to ensure that `number` is at least 15 for the loop to execute one more time.

No other variables in the loop head (`size` and `i`) need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. `size` is fixed at 3, and `i` is fixed at 0 in the given state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`number` must be at least 15, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 3, `i` is 0, `value` is 7**
