To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and the expression `max(sequence, default=0)`.

From the previous iteration, we know:
- `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18.
- `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `size` is floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1.
- `value` is 2^(floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1) - 1.
- If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, then `size_overlap` is (size, i). Otherwise, `size_overlap` remains (0, 0).
- The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `max(sequence, default=0)` to `-1`, decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's denote `max(sequence, default=0)` as `max_seq` for simplicity. At the start of the first iteration, `i` is initialized to `max_seq`. In subsequent iterations, `i` is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since the only variables we can adjust are those in the loop head, and `max_seq` is a derived value from `sequence`, we do not need to adjust `sequence` itself. We only need to adjust `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size` is floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1, `value` is 2^(floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1) - 1, `i` is `max(sequence, default=0) + 1` if this is the first iteration, otherwise `i` is the value of `i` from the end of the previous iteration incremented by 1.**

Given that we are moving to the start of the next iteration, we increment `i` by 1:

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size` is floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1, `value` is 2^(floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1) - 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
