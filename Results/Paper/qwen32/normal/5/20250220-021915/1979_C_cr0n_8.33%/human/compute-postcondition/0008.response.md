Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `k` is a list of `n` integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least two elements; `prod` is the product of its previous value and `r`; `r` is the next element in `vals`. `prod` has been updated to `prod * r`.**

Natural language: The value of `prod` has been updated to the product of its previous value and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
