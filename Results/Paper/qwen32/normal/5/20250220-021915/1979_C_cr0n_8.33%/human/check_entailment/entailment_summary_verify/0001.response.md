Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to distribute bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) on \( n \) possible outcomes with multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \) such that for every winning outcome \( i \), the returned amount \( k_i \times x_i \) is strictly greater than the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes, i.e., \( k_i \times x_i > \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \).

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \( prod = k_1 \times k_2 \times \ldots \times k_n \).

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - It calculates the bets as \( vprod[i] = \frac{prod}{k_i} \) for each outcome \( i \).
   - It calculates the denominator \( den = prod - \sum_{i=1}^{n} vprod[i] \).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If \( den \leq 0 \), it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets \( vprod \).

### Evaluation of the Program
Let's consider whether this approach correctly solves the problem:
- The bets are calculated as \( vprod[i] = \frac{prod}{k_i} \).
- For each winning outcome \( i \), the returned amount is \( k_i \times vprod[i] = prod \).
- The total bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} vprod[i] = prod - den \).

For the program to be correct, the following condition must hold:
\[ k_i \times vprod[i] > \sum_{j=1}^{n} vprod[j] \]
Substituting \( vprod[i] = \frac{prod}{k_i} \) and \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} vprod[j] = prod - den \), we get:
\[ k_i \times \frac{prod}{k_i} > prod - den \]
\[ prod > prod - den \]
\[ den > 0 \]

This condition matches the check in the program:
- If \( den \leq 0 \), the program correctly returns `-1` because a valid distribution of bets is not possible.
- If \( den > 0 \), the program prints the bets \( vprod \).

### Verification Against Function Summary
The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`:
- It reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input.
- It calculates the product of all elements in `vals`.
- It computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` except the corresponding element.
- It calculates `den` as the difference between the product and the sum of `vprod`.
- If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`.
- Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the feasibility of the solution. It adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **True**
