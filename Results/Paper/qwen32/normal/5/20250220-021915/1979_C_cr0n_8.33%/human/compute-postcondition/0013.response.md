Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print(-1)` statement is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.
   - `k` is a list of `n` integers, each between 2 and 20.
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is calculated as `prod // vals[i]` for each index `i` in `vals`.
   - `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(-1)` is straightforward and will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, `vprod`, or `den`. It is a simple output of the integer `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
