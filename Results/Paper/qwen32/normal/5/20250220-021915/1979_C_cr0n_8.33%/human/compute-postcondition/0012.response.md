Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `k` is a list of `n` integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input; `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`; `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod // vals[i]` for each index `i` in `vals`; `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`. The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.**
