The only object in the loop head is the variable `q`, which iterates over the string `e`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `q` for the next iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is the current character in the string `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` needs to be the next character in the string `e`.

Given that `q` is the next character in the string `e` after the current value of `q`, we need to update `q` to the subsequent character in the string `e`. 

Let's denote the current position of `q` in the string `e` as `position`. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` was at `position`. For the next iteration, `q` should be at `position + 1`.

However, since we do not have the exact position of `q` in the string `e`, we can only state that `q` should be the next character in the string `e` after its current value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e` after its current value. If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.**
