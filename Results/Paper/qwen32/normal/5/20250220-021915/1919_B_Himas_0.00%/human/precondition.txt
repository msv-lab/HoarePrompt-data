Each test case contains a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of string s, and the second line contains the string s (s_i ∈ {"+", "-"}, |s| = n).
