Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e` after its current value. If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 3.**

Note: The if part's postcondition seems to have an error in the description of `P` and `M` values, so it is not included in the final postcondition as it contradicts the given precondition and else part's postcondition.
