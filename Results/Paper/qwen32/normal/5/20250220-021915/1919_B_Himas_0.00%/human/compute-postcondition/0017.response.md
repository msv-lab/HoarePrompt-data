The code snippet provided increments the value of `M` by 1. Based on the initial state, the value of `M` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `q`. After the increment, if `q` was '+', `M` was initially 1 and becomes 2. If `q` was not '+', `M` was initially 2 and becomes 3. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e` after its current value. If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 2. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 3.**
