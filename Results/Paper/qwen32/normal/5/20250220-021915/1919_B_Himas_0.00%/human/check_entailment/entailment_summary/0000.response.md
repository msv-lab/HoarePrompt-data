Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array derived from the string `s` into subarrays, where the penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program, however, only calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and outputs this difference, which does not address the problem's requirements. The optimal splitting of the array and the calculation of penalties are not performed.

Correctness: **False**
