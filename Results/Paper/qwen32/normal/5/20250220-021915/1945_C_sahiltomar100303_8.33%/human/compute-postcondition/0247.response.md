Postcondition: **`t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` is not equal to `0`; `leftMove` remains `0`; `right` equals `n`, satisfying the conditions `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - n) // 2`; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted such that `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` and `tleftOne >= (n + 1) // 2 - tleftZero`; `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted such that `trightOne >= 0` and `trightZero >= 0 - trightOne`; `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is not `0`.**
