Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `left` is not equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is not equal to `n`, the loop conditions are no longer satisfied, and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**
