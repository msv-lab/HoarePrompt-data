Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is not '0', otherwise it is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is not '0', otherwise it is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `leftMove` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the variable `left` has been decremented by 1, so it now holds the value `n // 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
