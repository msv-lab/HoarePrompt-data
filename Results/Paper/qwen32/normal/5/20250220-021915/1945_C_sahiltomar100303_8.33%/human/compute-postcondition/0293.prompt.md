Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains `t`, `n` is the user's input, `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input string, `mid` remains `n // 2`, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` remains `n`, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, If `right` is equal to `n`, `trightOne` is adjusted to be at least `(n + 1) // 2` if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `trightOne < (n + 1) // 2`, If `right` is not equal to `n`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted such that `trightOne >= (n - right) // 2` and `trightZero >= (n - right) // 2 - trightOne`, If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the conditions `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right) // 2` are satisfied, If `left` is not 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted based on the conditions specified, If `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`, the condition `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains `t`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input string, `mid` remains `n // 2`, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` remains `n`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is '1', then `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains `t`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input string, `mid` remains `n // 2`, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[0]` is '0' else 1, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1` if `s[0]` is '1' else remains 1 if `s[0]` is '1', `trightZero` remains 0, `trightOne` remains 0, `leftZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is '0' else remains 1 if `s[0]` is '0', `leftOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is '1' else remains 1 if `s[0]` is '1', `rightZero` remains 0, `rightOne` remains 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains `t`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input string, `mid` remains `n // 2`, `left` remains either 0 or not 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is 1, `tleftZero` is either 2 or 3 if `s[0]` is '0' else 2 if `s[0]` is '1', `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 regardless of `s[0]`, `trightZero` remains 0, `trightOne` remains 0, `leftZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is '0' else incremented by 2 if `s[0]` is '1', `leftOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is '0' else incremented by 2 if `s[0]` is '1', `rightZero` remains 0, `rightOne` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
