The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`. After the increment, `rightZero` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s such that `leftZero < (mid + 1) // 2` and `rightOne < (n - mid + 1) // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s` plus 1, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `i` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s` plus 1, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`, and `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**
