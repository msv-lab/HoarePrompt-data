Output State: **`t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` remains `0`; `leftMove` remains `0`; `right` remains `mid + 1`; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` is now `tleftZero + 1`; `tleftOne` remains adjusted such that `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` is now `trightZero - 1`; `trightOne` remains adjusted such that `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`; `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0**

In simpler terms, the value of `trightZero` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values.
