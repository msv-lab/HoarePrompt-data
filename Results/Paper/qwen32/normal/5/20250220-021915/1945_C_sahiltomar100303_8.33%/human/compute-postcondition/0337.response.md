The code snippet increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify a value for `rightOne`. Therefore, we can only describe the change in terms of the operation performed. The other variables (`n`, `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -2, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
