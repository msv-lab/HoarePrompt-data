The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of the variable `rightOne` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the new user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 1, `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is either `n` or the position where the loop conditions are no longer satisfied, `i` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, and `s[i]` is '1'**.
