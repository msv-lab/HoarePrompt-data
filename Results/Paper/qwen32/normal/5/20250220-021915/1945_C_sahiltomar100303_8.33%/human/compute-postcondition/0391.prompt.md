Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is either `n` or the position where the loop conditions are no longer satisfied. If `left` is 0 and `right` equals `n`, then `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0 and `right` equals `n`, then `leftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the loop continues with the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` is either 0 or not 0; `leftMove` remains 0; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted such that `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `tleftOne >= (right + 1) // 2 - tleftZero`; `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted based on the value of `right` and the conditions specified; `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0 or not 0. If `right` is equal to `n`, `trightOne` is adjusted to be at least `(n + 1) // 2` if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `trightOne < (n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted such that `trightOne >= (n - right) // 2` and `trightZero >= (n - right) // 2 - trightOne`. If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the conditions `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right) // 2` are satisfied. If `left` is not 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted based on the conditions specified. If `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`, the condition `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is 2, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0]` is '1' otherwise unchanged, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 1, `trightZero` is 0 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 0, `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is '1' otherwise 0, `trightOne` is 0 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to 2, then `right` remains not equal to 2. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to 2, then `rightOne` is less than 2. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is 2, then `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 if it meets the condition. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is not 2, then the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
