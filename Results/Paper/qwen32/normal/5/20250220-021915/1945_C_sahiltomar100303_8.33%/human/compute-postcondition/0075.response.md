Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`**.

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values except `rightZero`, which has been incremented by 1.
