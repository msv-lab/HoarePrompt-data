Postcondition: **`t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` is not equal to `0`; `leftMove` remains `0`; `i` remains `n`; `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is not `0`. If `right` equals `n`, `trightOne` is adjusted such that `trightOne >= 0` and `trightZero >= 0 - trightOne`. If `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is adjusted such that `trightOne >= 0` and `trightZero >= 0 - trightOne`. Otherwise, `tleftZero < (n + 1) // 2` and `tleftOne >= (n + 1) // 2 - tleftZero`, and `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted such that `trightOne >= 0` and `trightZero >= 0 - trightOne`. If `right` is not equal to `n` and satisfies the conditions `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right) // 2`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted such that `trightOne >= (n - right) // 2` and `trightZero >= (n - right) // 2 - trightOne`. If `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`, the condition `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**
