The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. The other variables `mid`, `i`, and `rightOne` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`, `trightOne` is `trightOne + 1`**.

In natural language, this means that `mid` remains less than `n`, `i` is still `i + 1`, `rightOne` is still `rightOne + 1`, and `trightOne` has been incremented by 1.
