Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1` and `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2` with `rightZero` increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2` plus 1, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**
