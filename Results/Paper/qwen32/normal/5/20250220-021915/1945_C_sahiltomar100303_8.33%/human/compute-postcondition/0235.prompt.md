Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` remains `0`; `leftMove` remains `0`; `right` is now `mid`; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` remain the counts of '0's and '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` and `trightOne` remain the counts of '0's and '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`; `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` remains `0`; `leftMove` remains `0`; `right` is now `mid + 1`; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on `s[right]` such that `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[right]` is '1', while maintaining `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted based on `s[right]` such that `trightZero` is decremented by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', and `trightOne` is decremented by 1 if `s[right]` is '1', while maintaining `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`; `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` remains `0`; `leftMove` remains `0`; `right` is now `mid + 2`; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted such that `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted such that `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`; `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `trightOne` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` remains `0`; `leftMove` remains `0`; `right` is `mid + 3`; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 3) // 2`; `trightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2 - 1) // 2`; `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. If `s[right]` is '1', then `trightOne` is decremented by 1 and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
