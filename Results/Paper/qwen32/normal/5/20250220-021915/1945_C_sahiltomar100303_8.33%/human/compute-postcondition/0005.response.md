The provided code snippet initializes a variable `leftZero` to 0. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `mid`) as they are not modified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `leftZero` while keeping the other variables in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0**.
