Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -2, `rightZero` is 2**

Natural Language: The value of `leftOne` was decremented by 1, but since `leftOne` was not defined in the initial state, it seems there might be a typo or missing variable. Assuming `left` was meant to be decremented, `left` is now 0. The values of `n`, `leftZero`, and `rightZero` remain unchanged.
