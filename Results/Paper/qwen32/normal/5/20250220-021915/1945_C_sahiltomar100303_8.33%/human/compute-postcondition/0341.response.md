The code snippet `right = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. The initial state does not specify the value of `mid`, so we will include `mid` in the output state to indicate that `right` now holds the value of `mid`.

Output State: **n is 2, left is 0, leftZero is -1 if s[0] is '0' otherwise 0, rightZero is 1 if s[0] is '0' otherwise 0, rightOne is 1 if s[0] is '1' otherwise unchanged, right is mid, other variables remain the same.**
