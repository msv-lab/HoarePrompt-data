Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0] is '1' otherwise unchanged, `right` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightOne` is 0, and `s[right]` is '0'; `trightZero` is 0**

Natural language explanation: The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
