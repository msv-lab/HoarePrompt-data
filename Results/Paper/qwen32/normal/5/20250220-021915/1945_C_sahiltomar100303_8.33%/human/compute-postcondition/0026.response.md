Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2` (which is at least 1), `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is '1', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2, `trightOne` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block executes, the variables `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the value of `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are set to 2, while if `s[i]` is '1', `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are set to 2. All other variables (`rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`) remain 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `mid` remain unchanged.
