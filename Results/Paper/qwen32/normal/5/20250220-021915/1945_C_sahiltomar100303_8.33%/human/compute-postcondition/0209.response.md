The code snippet `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `left` is `mid - 2`
- After decrementing `left` by 1, `left` becomes `(mid - 2) - 1` which simplifies to `mid - 3`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `mid - 3`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `i` is `n`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s` plus 1 and `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1. Otherwise, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s` plus 1 and `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s` plus 1, and `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1. `leftZero` is less than `(mid - 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`.**
