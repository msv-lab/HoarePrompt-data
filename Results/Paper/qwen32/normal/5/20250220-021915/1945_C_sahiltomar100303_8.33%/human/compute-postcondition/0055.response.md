The code snippet provided is `left = mid`. This means the variable `left` is being assigned the value of `mid`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. The value of `mid` is calculated as `n // 2` from the initial state, so `left` will take on that value.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2`.**
