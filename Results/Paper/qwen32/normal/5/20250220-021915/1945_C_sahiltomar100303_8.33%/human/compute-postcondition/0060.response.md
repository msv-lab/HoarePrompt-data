The code snippet provided increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is -1, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, and the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'.**
