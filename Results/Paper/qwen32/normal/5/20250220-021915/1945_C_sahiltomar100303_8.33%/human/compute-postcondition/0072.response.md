Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` and `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 2 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus 2 if `s[left - 2]` is not '0', otherwise it is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus 1, and `rightOne` is 3. `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are the total number of '0's and '1's in the respective halves of `s`, adjusted by the conditions on `s[left - 2]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, so it is now `n // 2 - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
