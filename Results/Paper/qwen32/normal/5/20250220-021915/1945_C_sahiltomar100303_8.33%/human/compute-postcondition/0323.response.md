The provided code snippet only affects the variable `rightOne` by incrementing its value by 1. Therefore, `rightOne` which was initially 0 is now 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 1, `leftZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 1, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'**.
