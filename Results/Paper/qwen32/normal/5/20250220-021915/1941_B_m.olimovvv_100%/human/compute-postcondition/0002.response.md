The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `b`. The variables `t` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
