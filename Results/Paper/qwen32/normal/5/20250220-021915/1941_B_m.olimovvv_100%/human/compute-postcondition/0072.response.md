The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `a` and `i`. It only terminates the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is at least `i + 3`; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
