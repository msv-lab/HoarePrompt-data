The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` essentially sets `b[i]` to 0 because subtracting a value from itself results in 0. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged.**
