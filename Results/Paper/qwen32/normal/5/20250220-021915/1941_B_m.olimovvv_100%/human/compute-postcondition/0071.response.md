The given initial state provides conditions on the variables `a` and `i`, but the `print` statement does not reference these variables directly. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Let's break down the information given:
- `a` is at least `i + 3` (this means `a >= i + 3`).
- `i` is `i + 1` (this statement seems to imply an increment operation, but it's not clear in the context of the print statement).

However, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `a` or `i`. It will always output 'NO' regardless of the values of `a` and `i`.

So, the output of the print statement is simply 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
