The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is broken out of if `b[i]` is less than 0, but since the code snippet itself does not include that condition, we assume `b[i]` is not less than 0 for the execution of this line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`.**
