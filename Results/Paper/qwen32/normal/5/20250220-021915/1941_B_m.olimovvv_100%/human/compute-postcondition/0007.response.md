Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the current element `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `a`, or `b`.**
