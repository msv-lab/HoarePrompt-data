To determine if the provided program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` (which is not actually used in the logic) and the password string itself.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the password string and stores the result.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found (`last_digit_index`).
     - If a letter is encountered after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all these checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are accumulated in the `results` list and then printed, separated by newlines.

### Evaluation:
- The program correctly separates digits and letters.
- It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by keeping track of the last digit's index.
- It checks that both the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
