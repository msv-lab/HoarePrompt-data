Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to 1. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not equal to -1, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (or continues to the next statement).**
