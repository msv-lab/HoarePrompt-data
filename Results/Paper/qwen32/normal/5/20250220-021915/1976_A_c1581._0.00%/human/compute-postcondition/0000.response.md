The code snippet initializes an empty list named `digits`. This action does not affect the value of the `password` string or the integer `n`. Therefore, the `password` remains a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is an empty list.**
