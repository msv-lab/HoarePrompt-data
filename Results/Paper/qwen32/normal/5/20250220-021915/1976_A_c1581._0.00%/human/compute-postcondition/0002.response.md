The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over each character in the `password` string. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If the `password` string has at least one character, the loop will execute.

Given that the `password` is already defined as a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 <= n <= 20`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The `digits` and `letters` lists being empty does not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list**
