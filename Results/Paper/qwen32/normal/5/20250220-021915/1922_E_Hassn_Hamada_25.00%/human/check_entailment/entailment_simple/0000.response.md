### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem of generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to generate an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The array can have at most 200 elements.
- Each element of the array should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
- If it's impossible to generate such an array, we should output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads a number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `X` which represents the required number of increasing subsequences. It then calls a function `func_1` to generate the array.

The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the sequence is exactly `X`.

```python
def func_1(number, sequence):
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
    return size + result
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Binary Representation of X**: The function seems to be using a binary representation of `X` to generate the sequence. The expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is equivalent to \(2^{size+1} - 1\), which represents the sum of the first `size+1` powers of 2 (i.e., the binary representation of a number with `size+1` 1s).
2. **Recursive Call**: The function makes a recursive call with `number - (1 << size) + 1`. This suggests that it is breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.
3. **Sequence Construction**: The function appends integers from `0` to `size-1` to the sequence and then modifies the sequence based on the result of the recursive call.

#### Issues:
1. **Base Case**: The base case is correct (`if number == 0: return 0`).
2. **Recursive Case**: The logic for the recursive case seems flawed. The expression `number - (1 << size) + 1` does not correctly reduce the problem size in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
3. **Sequence Modification**: The modification of the sequence based on the result of the recursive call (`sequence[-result - i - 1] += result`) does not align with the goal of generating a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

#### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly generate a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for breaking down the problem and modifying the sequence is flawed.

### Correctness: **False**
