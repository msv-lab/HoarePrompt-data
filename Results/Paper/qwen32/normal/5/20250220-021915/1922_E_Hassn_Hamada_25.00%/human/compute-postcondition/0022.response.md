The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `size`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 (since the previous `i` value was 1, and it gets incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration), and `size` is 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3, and `size` remains 9.

The state of `number`, `sequence`, and `result` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Output State:
State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` has its element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result`, `size` is 9, `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence), `i` is 3**
