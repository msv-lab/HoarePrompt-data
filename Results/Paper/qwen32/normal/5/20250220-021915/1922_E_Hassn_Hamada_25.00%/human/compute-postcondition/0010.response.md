The value of `size` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `size` is 3, so after the operation, `size` becomes 4. The values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `number` must be at least 15, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, `size` is 4.

Output State: **`number` must be at least 15, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, `size` is 4.**
