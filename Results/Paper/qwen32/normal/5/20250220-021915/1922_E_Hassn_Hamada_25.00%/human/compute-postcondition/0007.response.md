To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. Here, `1 << size + 1` is equivalent to \(2^{(size + 1)}\), and subtracting 1 from this value gives \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `number` must be at least 3.
- `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.
- `size` is 2.

Let's evaluate the expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` with the current `size` value of 2:

- `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1` = `(1 << 3) - 1` = \(2^3 - 1\) = 7

For the loop to execute one more time, `number` must be at least 7. Since `number` is currently at least 3, it needs to be adjusted to be at least 7.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `number` and `size`. The variable `sequence` is not part of the loop condition and does not need to be modified.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`number` must be at least 7, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, `size` is 2**.
