The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `size` is 9. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` will be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `size` remains unchanged.

The states of `number`, `sequence`, and `result` are not mentioned in the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` has its element at index `-result - 4` incremented by `result`, `size` is 9, `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence), `i` is 4**
