Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the function is called once per test case with the length of `b` being `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). There are `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) such test cases, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the decoded string `s`.**

Explanation: The function is defined but not executed in the provided snippet. Therefore, the state of `b` remains unchanged. The function is expected to return a decoded string `s` based on the input `b`, but since no execution has taken place, `s` is not yet defined. The preconditions regarding the length and number of test cases remain valid.
