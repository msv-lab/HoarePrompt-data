The code snippet `s += char_map[c]` appends the value associated with the key `c` in the dictionary `char_map` to the string `s`. The variable `c` is defined as the next character in `b`, and since `c` is used to index `char_map`, it is assumed that `c` is a key in `char_map`.

Given the initial state, the value of `s` is updated by concatenating the current value of `s` with `char_map[c]`. The other variables (`b` and `char_map`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is the next character in `b`; `s` is updated to `s + char_map[c]`.**
