To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head: `i` and `c`.

Here's the given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character.
- `i` is 1.
- `c` is the second character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.
- `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Let's break it down:

1. `sorted(set(b))` generates a sorted list of unique characters from the string `b`.
2. `enumerate` pairs each character in this list with its index.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` was 1, meaning the second character in the sorted unique characters of `b` was processed.
- `c` was the second character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.

For the next iteration, the loop will process the next character in the sorted unique characters of `b`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `c` should be updated to the next character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.

Let's denote the sorted unique characters of `b` as `sorted_unique_chars`. Since `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, `c` was `sorted_unique_chars[1]`. In the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and `c` will be `sorted_unique_chars[2]`.

So the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 2.
- `c` is the third character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.

The other variables (`b` and `char_map`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character in the sorted unique characters of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))`**
