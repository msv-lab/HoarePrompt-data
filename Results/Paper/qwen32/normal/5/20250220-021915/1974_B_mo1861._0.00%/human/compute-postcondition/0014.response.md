The code snippet `s += char_map[c]` appends the value of `char_map[c]` to the existing string `s`. Given the initial state, `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in the sorted set of `b` to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing by 1 in reverse order. The variable `s` already includes the character `char_map[c]`, and `c` is the next character in `b` that needs to be processed.

After executing the code, the string `s` will now include an additional character, which is the value of `char_map[c]` corresponding to the next character `c` in `b`. The other variables (`char_map`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent unique character, in reverse order of their sorted appearance; `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]` twice; `b` must be a non-empty string with at least one more character to process; `c` is the next character in `b`.**
