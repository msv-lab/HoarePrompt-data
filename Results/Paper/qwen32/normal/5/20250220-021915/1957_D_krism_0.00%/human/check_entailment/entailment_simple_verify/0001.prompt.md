You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \). The code seems to be attempting to use prefix XOR values and bit counts to solve the problem, but it does not correctly handle the required conditions.

Let's analyze the issues with the code:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the prefix XOR values for the array.
2. **Bit Count Arrays**: The code initializes `pre` and `suf` arrays to keep track of bit counts, but the logic for updating and using these arrays is incorrect.
3. **Tuple Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the valid tuples (x, y, z) is flawed. The condition `ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` does not correctly reflect the condition \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \).

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
3
6 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
The code does not produce the correct output for this input.

To verify the correctness, let's manually check the tuples for the given input:

- For (1, 2, 2): \( f(1, 2) \oplus f(2, 2) = 6 \oplus 2 = 4 \) and \( f(1, 2) = 6 \), so \( 4 > 6 \) is False.
- For (1, 1, 3): \( f(1, 1) \oplus f(1, 3) = 6 \oplus (6 \oplus 2 \oplus 4) = 6 \oplus 0 = 6 \) and \( f(1, 3) = 0 \), so \( 6 > 0 \) is True.
- For (1, 2, 3): \( f(1, 2) \oplus f(2, 3) = 6 \oplus (2 \oplus 4) = 6 \oplus 6 = 0 \) and \( f(1, 3) = 0 \), so \( 0 > 0 \) is False.
- For (1, 3, 3): \( f(1, 3) \oplus f(3, 3) = 0 \oplus 4 = 4 \) and \( f(1, 3) = 0 \), so \( 4 > 0 \) is True.
- For (2, 2, 2): \( f(2, 2) \oplus f(2, 2) = 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \) and \( f(2, 2) = 2 \), so \( 0 > 2 \) is False.
- For (2, 2, 3): \( f(2, 2) \oplus f(2, 3) = 2 \oplus 4 = 6 \) and \( f(2, 3) = 6 \), so \( 6 > 6 \) is False.
- For (2, 3, 3): \( f(2, 3) \oplus f(3, 3) = 6 \oplus 4 = 2 \) and \( f(2, 3) = 6 \), so \( 2 > 6 \) is False.
- For (3, 3, 3): \( f(3, 3) \oplus f(3, 3) = 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \) and \( f(3, 3) = 4 \), so \( 0 > 4 \) is False.

The correct tuples are (1, 1, 3) and (1, 3, 3), so the expected output is 2, not 4 as the code seems to produce.

Thus, the code is incorrect for this test case and likely for other cases as well.
