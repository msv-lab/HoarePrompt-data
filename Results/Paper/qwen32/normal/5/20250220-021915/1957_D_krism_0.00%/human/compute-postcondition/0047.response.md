The given code snippet increments the value at `suf[j][1]` by 1. This means that the element at index `1` of the sublist `suf[j]` is increased by 1.

The initial state provided includes several variables and lists, but the only variable directly affected by the code snippet is `suf[j][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i - 1]`, `i` is `i - 1`. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`. `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1.**
