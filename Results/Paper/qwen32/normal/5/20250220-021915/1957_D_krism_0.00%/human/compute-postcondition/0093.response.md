The code snippet `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Since `j` is 1, this means `suf[1][0]` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 1, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1, `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1. Specifically, `suf[1][0]` is now `suf[1][0] - 1`.**
