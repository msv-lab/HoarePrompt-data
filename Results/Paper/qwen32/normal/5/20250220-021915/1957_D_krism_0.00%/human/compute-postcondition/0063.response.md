The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit `32`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `32`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is [0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)], `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to [1, 0], `cur` is `prefix[i]`, `i` is `i`, `j` is 1. If the j-th bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is the count of how many times the j-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all 32 iterations + 1. If the j-th bit of `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is the count of how many times the j-th bit of `cur` was 0 across all 32 iterations + 1.**
