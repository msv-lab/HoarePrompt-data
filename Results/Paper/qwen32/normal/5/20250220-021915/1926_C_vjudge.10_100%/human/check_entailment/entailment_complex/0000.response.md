### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` for each possible `n` up to `2 * 10^5`. This is done in an efficient manner, allowing the program to handle up to 10,000 test cases within the given time constraints.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `inf` is set to `2 * 10^5 + 1` to ensure the array `values` can hold the precomputed sums up to the maximum possible `n`.
   - `values` is an array of size `inf` initialized to zero. This array will store the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i`.

2. **Precomputing the Sums:**
   - The program iterates through each number `i` from 1 to `inf - 1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`).
   - It then updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i - 1]` and `sum_value_digits`. This effectively accumulates the sum of digits from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly precomputes the required sums and handles multiple test cases efficiently. The use of precomputation ensures that the program can respond to each test case in constant time, making it suitable for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program adheres to the problem requirements and handles the input and output as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
