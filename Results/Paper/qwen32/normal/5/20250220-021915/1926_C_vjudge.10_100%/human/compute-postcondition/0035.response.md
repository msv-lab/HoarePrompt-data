The code snippet reads an input value and assigns it to the variable `value`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The variable `value` is newly introduced and assigned the value of the next input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `value` is an input integer.**
