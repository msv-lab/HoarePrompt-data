Correctness: **True**

The provided program efficiently precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sums in an array. For each test case, it simply retrieves the precomputed result, which ensures that the solution is fast enough to meet the time constraints (0.5 seconds per test case).

The logic in the program is correct:
1. It first calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000.
2. It then accumulates these sums so that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
3. For each test case, it reads the input `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the desired result.

The program handles the upper limit of `n` (200,000) efficiently, and the cumulative sum array allows for constant-time retrieval of the answer for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
