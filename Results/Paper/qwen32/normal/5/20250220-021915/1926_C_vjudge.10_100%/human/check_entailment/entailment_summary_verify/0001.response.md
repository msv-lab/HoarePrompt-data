### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program and verify its correctness based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Understanding
The task is to compute the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to \( n \) for multiple test cases. The program needs to handle up to \( 10^4 \) test cases, with each test case containing an integer \( n \) up to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

#### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` to store the cumulative sums of the digit sums up to each index.
   - The array is initialized with zeros.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to `inf - 1` (i.e., up to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \)).
   - For each integer \( i \), it calculates the sum of its digits and adds this to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i-1]`.
   - The result is stored in `values[i]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and outputs the precomputed cumulative sum stored in `values[n]`.

#### Correctness
- **Precomputation**: The precomputation step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \). This step is crucial for efficiently handling multiple test cases.
- **Output**: For each test case, the program simply accesses the precomputed value in `values[n]`, which is correct as it contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to \( n \).

#### Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**: The precomputation step runs in \( O(m \cdot d) \), where \( m \) is the maximum possible value of \( n \) (\( 2 \cdot 10^5 \)) and \( d \) is the number of digits in the largest number (6 in this case). This results in a time complexity of \( O(1.2 \cdot 10^6) \), which is within the time limit of 0.5 seconds.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the maximum possible value of \( n \) (\( 2 \cdot 10^5 + 1 \)), which is feasible given the constraints.

### Verification Using Function Summary
The function summary states that the function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `n` and prints the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`. This is exactly what the program does, as described in the analysis.

### Conclusion
The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sums of the digit sums and efficiently handles up to \( 10^4 \) test cases within the given time and space constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
