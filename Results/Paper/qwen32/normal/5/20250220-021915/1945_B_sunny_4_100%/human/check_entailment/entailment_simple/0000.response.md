Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks visible at any given time from each installation and then summing these values. However, this approach does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. 

Let's break down the program's logic and the correct approach:

### Provided Program's Logic:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
- It calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2`.
- It prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Overlap:**
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.
   - The `+2` at the end is incorrect and does not reflect the overlap logic.

2. **Lack of Overlap Consideration:**
   - The program needs to consider the times when fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time, which happens periodically with a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlap within a period of LCM(a, b).

### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
- Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a period of LCM(a, b).
- Calculate the number of overlapping fireworks within the same period.
- The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time will be the sum of fireworks from both installations minus the double-counted overlapping fireworks.

### Correct Formula:
- Let `lcm = LCM(a, b)`.
- Number of fireworks from the first installation within `lcm` minutes: `lcm // a`.
- Number of fireworks from the second installation within `lcm` minutes: `lcm // b`.
- Number of overlapping fireworks within `lcm` minutes: `lcm // (a * b) * (m + 1) // lcm`.
- Maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time: `lcm // a + lcm // b - lcm // (a * b)`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
