To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the value of `ans` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m/a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m/b) + 1`.
- `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is defined by the formula:
\[ \text{ans} = \left(\frac{m}{a}\right) + \left(\frac{m}{b}\right) + 2 \]

Where:
- `m // a` denotes integer division of `m` by `a`.
- `m // b` denotes integer division of `m` by `b`.

### Explanation of the Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m // a is the integer division of m by a, m // b is the integer division of m by b, and the final result is increased by 2)**
