The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The variable `t` and `qi` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the integers read from the input, while `t` and `qi` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `qi` is `qi + 1`.**
