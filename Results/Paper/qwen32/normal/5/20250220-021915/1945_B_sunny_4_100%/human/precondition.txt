Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}), where a and b are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m is the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky after launch. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
