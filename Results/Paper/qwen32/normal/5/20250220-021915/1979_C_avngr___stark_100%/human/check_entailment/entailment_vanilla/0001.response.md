Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine a way to distribute the coins for each of the possible outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. 

Given that for each outcome `i`, if it wins, the amount received is `k_i * x_i` where `x_i` is the bet on outcome `i`, the condition to satisfy is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i * x_i \quad \forall i \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) * x_i \quad \forall i \]

This means for each outcome, the sum of the bets on other outcomes must be less than the bet on the current outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

### Code Analysis

The provided code contains two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. `func_2(numbers)`: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers.

However, these functions do not directly address the problem of finding the appropriate bets `x_i` for each outcome. The problem requires finding a specific distribution of `x_i` that satisfies the condition mentioned above, and the provided code does not attempt to do so.

### Possible Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve finding a set of `x_i` such that:
\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) * x_i \quad \forall i \]

One possible way to solve this problem is to set `x_i = LCM(k_1 - 1, k_2 - 1, ..., k_n - 1) // (k_i - 1)`. This ensures that for each `i`, the sum of the bets on other outcomes is less than `x_i * (k_i - 1)`.

However, the provided code does not implement this logic. It simply calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_i`, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_i` but does not provide a valid distribution of bets `x_i` that satisfies the given conditions.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
Correctness: **False**
