a is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99) and a is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99) and b is odd. The field is described by a grid of size a x b, where each cell contains either "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". There are between 1 and 5 goals for each team, exactly one Quaffle, and at most one Bludger. The number of players for each team is between 1 and 10. The next input is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action is either a move (U, D, L, R), a catch (C), or a throw (T) as specified in the problem description.
