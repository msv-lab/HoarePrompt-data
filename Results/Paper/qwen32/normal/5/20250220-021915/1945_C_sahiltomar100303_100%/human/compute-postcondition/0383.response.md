To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Given Initial State:
- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`.
- `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne < (n + 1) // 2`.
- `right` is `n`.
- `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`.
- Additionally, `right` is explicitly stated to be `n`.

### Key Points:
- The variable `right` is directly stated to be `n`.
- There is no further manipulation of `right` in the provided code snippet, so its value remains `n`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(right)
```

### Conclusion:
Since `right` is explicitly set to `n` and there are no further changes to `right` in the provided code snippet, the print statement will output the value of `n`.

Output: **n**
