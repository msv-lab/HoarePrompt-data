Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `right` is increased by 1 and must be less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1. In both cases, either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` is increased to satisfy the loop condition.**
