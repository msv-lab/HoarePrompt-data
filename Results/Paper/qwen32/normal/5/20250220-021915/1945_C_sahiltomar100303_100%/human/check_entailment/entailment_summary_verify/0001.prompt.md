You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a binary string `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer that represents a specific position in the string `a` based on the distribution of '0's and '1's in the left and right halves of the string. The function ensures that the number of '0's or '1's in the left or right segment of the string meets certain conditions, and the printed value indicates the optimal position that satisfies these conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to lay a road between houses such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side. The road can be placed before the first house (position 0), between any two houses, or after the last house (position n). The aim is to find the position i that minimizes the absolute difference between i and the middle of the village (n/2), while satisfying the condition for satisfaction.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It calculates `mid` as `n // 2`, which is the middle index of the village.

2. **Counting Initial Zeros and Ones:**
   - It initializes counters for zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the middle.
   - It counts the number of zeros and ones in the left half (`leftZero`, `leftOne`) and the right half (`rightZero`, `rightOne`).
   - It also maintains total counts of zeros and ones for the left and right sides (`tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`).

3. **Adjusting Left and Right Sides:**
   - It adjusts the left and right sides to find the optimal position for the road.
   - It moves the road to the left (`leftMove`) while the satisfaction condition is not met on either side.
   - It moves the road to the right (`rightMove`) while the satisfaction condition is not met on either side.

4. **Selecting the Optimal Position:**
   - It checks the conditions for the left and right positions.
   - It selects the position that is closer to the middle (`n/2`) and satisfies the satisfaction condition.
   - If both positions are equally close to the middle, it selects the smaller position.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Initial Counting:**
   - The initial counting of zeros and ones in the left and right halves is incorrect. The right half should start from `mid` to `n-1`, not from `mid` to `n`.
   - This means `rightZero` and `rightOne` are incorrectly initialized.

2. **Adjusting Left and Right Sides:**
   - The logic for adjusting the left and right sides is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the transitions between left and right sides.
   - The conditions for moving the road to the left and right are not correctly implemented.

3. **Selecting the Optimal Position:**
   - The logic for selecting the optimal position is correct, but the initial counts and adjustments are incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the initial counting and the adjustment logic, the program is incorrect. It does not correctly determine the optimal position for the road based on the satisfaction conditions.
