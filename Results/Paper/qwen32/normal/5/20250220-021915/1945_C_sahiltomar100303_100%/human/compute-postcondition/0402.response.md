Postcondition: **`left` is not equal to 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is not equal to `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`. The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`. If the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.**
