Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `leftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `tleftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `tleftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `i` is `mid + 1`; `rightZero` is `2` if `s[i]` was '0' initially, otherwise `rightZero` is `1`; `trightZero` is `2` if `s[i]` was '0' initially, otherwise `trightZero` is `2`.**

In simple terms, the variable `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. If `s[i]` was '0' initially, then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are both 2. If `s[i]` was not '0' initially, then `rightZero` remains 1, but `trightZero` is still 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
