Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`. If `right` was not equal to `n` before the if-else block, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`. If `right` was equal to `n` before the if-else block and `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` is adjusted to be less than `(n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, `rightOne` remains adjusted to be at least `(n + 1) // 2`.**
