The code snippet increments the variable `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `n` >= 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is 0. Additionally, the current character `s[i]` is '0'.**
