Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `right` is increased by 1 and must be less than `n-1`. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1. In both cases, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.**
