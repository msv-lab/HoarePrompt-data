Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0. If the current character at index `i` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is 1; otherwise, `leftOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is 1.**
