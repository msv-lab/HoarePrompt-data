Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 1` and `mid < n - 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `tleftOne` has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions and constraints.
