Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `leftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `tleftZero` is `count_zeros_first_half`; `tleftOne` is `count_ones_first_half`; `i` is `mid + 1`; `rightOne` is `3` and `trightOne` is `3`.**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` and `trightOne` is incremented by 1, making their values `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
