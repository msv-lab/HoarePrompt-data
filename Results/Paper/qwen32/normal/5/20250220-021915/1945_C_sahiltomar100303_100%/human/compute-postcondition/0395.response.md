Postcondition: **`left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`. Additionally, if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `tleftZero` meets or exceeds this threshold; otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
