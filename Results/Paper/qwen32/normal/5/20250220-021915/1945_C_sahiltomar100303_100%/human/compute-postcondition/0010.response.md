The code snippet provided initializes `trightZero` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same, except for `trightZero`, which is now explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0.**
