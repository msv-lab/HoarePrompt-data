Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1.**
