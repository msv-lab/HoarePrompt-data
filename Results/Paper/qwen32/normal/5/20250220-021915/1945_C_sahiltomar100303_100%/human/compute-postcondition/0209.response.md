The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. The conditions for `n` and `leftZero` must still hold after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4 to ensure `mid` is greater than 2; `leftZero` is now `leftZero - 1` and must still be less than `(left + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4 to ensure `mid` is greater than 2; `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` and must still be less than `(left + 1) // 2`.**
