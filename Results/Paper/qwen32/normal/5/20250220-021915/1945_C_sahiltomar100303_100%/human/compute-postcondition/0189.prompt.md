Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `rightZero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `trightZero` is 2 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `rightZero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 0, and is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0'; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 1 more than its previous value if `s[i]` is not '0'; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `trightZero` is either 3 or 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 2 or 0; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 1 more than its previous value if `s[i]` is not '0'; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `rightZero` is 2 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 2 more than its previous value if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 1 more than its previous value; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `trightZero` is either 5 or 3 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 4 or 2; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 2 more than its previous value if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 1 more than its previous value; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
