Postcondition: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` up to `right`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` up to `right`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` up to `right`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` up to `right`, and `left` is either not equal to 0 or equal to 0. If `left` is not equal to 0, the conditions for `right` are met as specified. If `left` is equal to 0, `right` is the smallest index where `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` if `tleftZero` meets the condition for the if part; otherwise, the conditions for `right` are met as specified. The current value of `right` is equal to `n`.**
