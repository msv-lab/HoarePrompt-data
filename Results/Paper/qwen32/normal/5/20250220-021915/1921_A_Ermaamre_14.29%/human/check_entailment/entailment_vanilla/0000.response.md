Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the area of a square given its four corners, with the sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The area of a square is the side length squared. Given the constraints, the side length can be determined by finding the difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the corners.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of the square. It then checks the x-coordinates of the corners to determine which pairs share the same x-coordinate, which indicates the vertical sides of the square. It then calculates the side length by finding the difference in the y-coordinates of these points. The same logic applies if the x-coordinates are different but the y-coordinates match, indicating horizontal sides.

### Correctness Check
Let's go through the logic step-by-step to see if it correctly identifies the side length and calculates the area:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the coordinates for each test case.
2. **Identifying Side Length**:
   - The program checks the x-coordinates of the points to identify pairs that share the same x-coordinate. If found, it calculates the side length using the difference in y-coordinates.
   - It also checks for cases where the y-coordinates match, indicating horizontal sides, and calculates the side length using the difference in x-coordinates.
3. **Area Calculation**: Once the side length is determined, the program squares it to get the area and prints it.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Test Case 1:**
- Points: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
- The program identifies that (1, 2) and (1, 5) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |5 - 2| = 3.
- Area = 3^2 = 9

**Test Case 2:**
- Points: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
- The program identifies that (-1, 1) and (-1, -1) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |1 - (-1)| = 2.
- Area = 2^2 = 4

**Test Case 3:**
- Points: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
- The program identifies that (45, 11) and (45, 39) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |39 - 11| = 28.
- Area = 28^2 = 784

The program correctly calculates the area for all provided test cases.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square given its corners. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
