The code snippet `res = abs(y1 - y2)` assigns the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2` to the variable `res`. This directly affects the value of `res`, while other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `res` provided in the initial state are not relevant to this specific line of code, as it directly sets `res` to `abs(y1 - y2)` regardless of the other conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are updated integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are the new integers provided by the input, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y2`.**
