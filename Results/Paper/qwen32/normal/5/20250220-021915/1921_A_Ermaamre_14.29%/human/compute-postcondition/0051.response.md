The code snippet `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `x3` and `y3` respectively. This means that the values of `x3` and `y3` will be updated based on the input provided. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res` (if it was defined) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are updated integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are integers provided by the input. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
