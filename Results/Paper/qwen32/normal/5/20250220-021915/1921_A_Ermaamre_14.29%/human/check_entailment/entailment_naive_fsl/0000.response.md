Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to determine the side length of a square based on the coordinates of its corners and then calculates the area. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly handle all possible configurations of the square's corners. Specifically, the program assumes a certain order of the coordinates and does not account for all possible permutations of the corners.

Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the program's incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
0 0
2 0
0 2
2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly calculate the side length as 0 because it does not correctly identify the side length from the given coordinates. The program assumes that if two x-coordinates are the same, the corresponding y-coordinates will give the side length, but it does not handle the case where the coordinates are given in a different order.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the unique x and y coordinates and then compute the side length based on the differences between the maximum and minimum x and y values. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        coords = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        x_coords = sorted(set([coord[0] for coord in coords]))
        y_coords = sorted(set([coord[1] for coord in coords]))
        side_length = max(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0], y_coords[1] - y_coords[0])
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program works correctly for all possible configurations of the square's corners.
