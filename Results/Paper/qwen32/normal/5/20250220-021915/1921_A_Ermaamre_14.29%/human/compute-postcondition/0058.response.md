Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are updated integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are the new integers provided by the input. If `y1 < y2`, `res` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y2`. Additionally, the conditions for the definition of `res` based on the equality of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` remain as specified in the precondition.**
