The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to the variable `res`. Given that `y1` is less than `y2`, the absolute difference `res` will be `y2 - y1`.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `x3` is equal to `x4`, `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is `y2 - y1`.**
