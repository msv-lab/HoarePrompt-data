The code snippet directly assigns the value of `abs(y1 - y3)` to `res`, regardless of the other conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `res` will be the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are updated integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are the new integers provided by the input, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`.**
