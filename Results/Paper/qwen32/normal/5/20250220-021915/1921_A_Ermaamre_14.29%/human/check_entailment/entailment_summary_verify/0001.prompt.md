You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the corners of a square and prints the area of the square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the area of a square given its four corners, with the sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The area of a square is the side length squared. Given the constraints, the side length can be determined by finding the difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the corners.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of the square. It then checks the x-coordinates of the corners to determine which pairs share the same x-coordinate, which indicates the vertical sides of the square. It then calculates the side length by finding the difference in the y-coordinates of these points. The same logic applies if the x-coordinates are different but the y-coordinates match, indicating horizontal sides.

### Correctness Check
Let's go through the logic step-by-step to see if it correctly identifies the side length and calculates the area:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the coordinates for each test case.
2. **Identifying Side Length**:
   - The program checks the x-coordinates of the points to identify pairs that share the same x-coordinate. If found, it calculates the side length using the difference in y-coordinates.
   - It also checks for cases where the y-coordinates match, indicating horizontal sides, and calculates the side length using the difference in x-coordinates.
3. **Area Calculation**: Once the side length is determined, the program squares it to get the area and prints it.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Test Case 1:**
- Points: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
- The program identifies that (1, 2) and (1, 5) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |5 - 2| = 3.
- Area = 3^2 = 9

**Test Case 2:**
- Points: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
- The program identifies that (-1, 1) and (-1, -1) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |1 - (-1)| = 2.
- Area = 2^2 = 4

**Test Case 3:**
- Points: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
- The program identifies that (45, 11) and (45, 39) share the same x-coordinate, so the side length is |39 - 11| = 28.
- Area = 28^2 = 784

The program correctly calculates the area for all provided test cases.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square given its corners. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
