Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, with each line containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

Natural language: The variable `a` is now assigned the integer value of the input. The initial conditions regarding the number of test cases and the coordinates of the corners of the squares remain unchanged.
