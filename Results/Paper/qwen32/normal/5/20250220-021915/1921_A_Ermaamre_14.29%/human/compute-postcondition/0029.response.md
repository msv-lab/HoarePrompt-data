To determine what will be printed by the `print(res ** 2)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input.
   - `res` is defined based on specific conditions related to the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4`.

2. **Conditions for `res`:**
   - If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
   - If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
   - If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - In all other cases, `res` is not defined by the given conditions.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(res ** 2)`

Given the above, the value of `res` is determined by the specific conditions described. Since the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions:

- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y1 - y3)`.
- If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`.
- If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.

In each of these cases, `res ** 2` will be the square of the respective absolute difference.

Since the exact values are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these conditions:

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is the absolute difference based on the conditions: abs(y1 - y3) if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, abs(y1 - y2) if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4, or abs(y2 - y1) if x1 == x4 and x3 == x2)**
