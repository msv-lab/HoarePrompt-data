Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input. `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2`. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

In simpler terms, `a` remains greater than 1 and `i` remains 2. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values. The variable `res` is set to the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2`, regardless of the condition in the if statement. The additional conditions for `res` based on the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` are preserved as described.
