The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x2` and `y2`. The initial state specifies that `a` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0, while `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input. These variables are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers provided by the input.**
