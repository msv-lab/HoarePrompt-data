The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `res`. Given that `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, the absolute difference will simply be `y1 - y2`.

Therefore, the value of `res` will be `y1 - y2`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, and `y2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input, `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `x3` is equal to `x4`, `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `res` is `y1 - y2`.**
