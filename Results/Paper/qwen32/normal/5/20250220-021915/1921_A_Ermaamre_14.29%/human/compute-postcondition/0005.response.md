The code provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x4` and `y4`. Therefore, the values of `x4` and `y4` will be the integers provided by the input after the code execution. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, and `x3`, `y3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are integers provided by the input.**
