Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `x3` are equal, `x2` and `x4` are equal, `y1` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `y2` and `y4` are integers provided by the input. If `y1` is less than `y3`, `res` is `y3 - y1`. Otherwise, `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, and `res` is `y1 - y3`.**
