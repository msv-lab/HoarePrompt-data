Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input, `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. In all other cases, the value of `res` is not defined by the given conditions.**
