Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of `res` based on the conditions provided and then compute `res ** 2` to find what will be printed.

1. **Initial State and Conditions:**
   - `a` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers.
   - Conditions for `res`:
     - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y1 - y3)`.
     - If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`.
     - If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
     - Otherwise, `res` is not defined.

2. **Determine the Value of `res`:**
   - Since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are not provided, we can only describe `res` based on the conditions.
   - `res` will be one of the following:
     - `abs(y1 - y3)` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`.
     - `abs(y1 - y2)` if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`.
     - `abs(y2 - y1)` if `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`.
     - `res` is not defined if none of the above conditions are met.

3. **Compute `res ** 2`:**
   - If `res` is defined, `res ** 2` will be the square of the absolute difference.
   - If `res` is not defined, the output will be undefined.

Given the conditions, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is the absolute value of the difference between the y-coordinates of the points if the x-coordinates match one of the specified conditions, otherwise res is not defined)**
