### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to compute the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners. The program then determines the side length of the square by comparing the x and y coordinates of the corners. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners.

2. **Determine Side Length**:
   - The program checks for which pair of x-coordinates are equal (since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, two pairs of x-coordinates will be equal, and the other two pairs of y-coordinates will also be equal).
   - Once the pairs are identified, the program calculates the side length of the square by taking the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points that have the same x-coordinate (or vice versa).

3. **Calculate and Print Area**:
   - The area of the square is then calculated by squaring the side length.
   - The area is printed for each test case.

The program correctly identifies the side length of the square by comparing the coordinates and calculates the area based on that. The given example input and output match the expected behavior of the program, indicating that the logic is correct.
