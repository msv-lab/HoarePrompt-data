Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is the size of a set and `k` is a number such that `1 <= k <= n`. The function returns a value (not further specified in the output description) for each test case based on the given constraints.**
