The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. The new value is calculated as `k - nums[idx]`, where `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.

Given the initial state, `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2. The value of `idx` is determined based on the condition \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \). After finding `idx`, the new value `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - nums[idx]]\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**

In simpler terms, `nums` now contains all its original elements plus an additional element which is `k - nums[idx]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
