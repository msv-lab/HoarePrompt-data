The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Given the initial state, `n` was at least 27, and `k` was the second integer from the input. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will be updated to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k + 1, 2k + 2]\), `idx` is 26**.
