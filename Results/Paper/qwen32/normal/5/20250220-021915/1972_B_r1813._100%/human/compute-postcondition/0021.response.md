Postcondition: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is `data[4]`, and `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `data[4]`. The value of `count_u` remains unchanged and retains its parity (odd or even) as it was before the if-else block.**
