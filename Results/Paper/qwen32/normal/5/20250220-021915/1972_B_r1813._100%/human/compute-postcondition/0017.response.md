The code increments the `index` variable by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `3 + 2 = 5`.

Output State: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is `data[4]`, and `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `data[4]`. If `count_u` is odd, then the current value of `count_u` is odd. Otherwise, `count_u` is even.**
