Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the input string. The key insight is that Alice wins if and only if the number of facing-up coins is odd. This is because each move flips two coins, preserving the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of facing-up coins, eventually leading to Bob's loss. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always respond in a way that leaves Alice with an even number of facing-up coins, leading to Alice's loss. Thus, the program's logic is correct.
