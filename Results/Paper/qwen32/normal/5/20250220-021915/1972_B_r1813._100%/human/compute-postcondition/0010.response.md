The given `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement prints the string `'YES'` directly. The preconditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string. The variables `data`, `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` are described in the initial state, but none of them are used within the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **YES**
