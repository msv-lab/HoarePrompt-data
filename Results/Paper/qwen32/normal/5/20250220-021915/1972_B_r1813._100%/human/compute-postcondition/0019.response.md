Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`data`**: A list where:
   - The first element (`data[0]`) is a string representation of a positive integer `t`.
   - `t` is a positive integer minus 1.
   - `index` is set to 5.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`.
   - `s` is `data[4]`.
   - `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `data[4]`.
   - If `count_u` is odd, then the current value of `count_u` is odd. Otherwise, `count_u` is even.

2. **Python Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

### Analysis:
The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the code and does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `data`, `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
