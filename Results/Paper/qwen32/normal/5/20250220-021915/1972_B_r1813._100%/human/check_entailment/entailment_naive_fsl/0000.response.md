Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it counts the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This decision is based on the observation that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner when both players play optimally.

### Key Points

1. **Parity of 'U' Coins**: The core logic is that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.
2. **Optimal Play**: The problem states that both players play optimally. It can be shown that the parity of 'U' coins is the decisive factor in the game's outcome.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Coin**: If there is only one coin, the parity rule still holds.
   - **Two Coins**: The rule also applies when there are two coins.
   - **No Coins**: The rule indirectly handles the case where no coins are left.

### Verification

Let's verify the program against the provided examples and some edge cases:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `5 UUDUD`
   - Count of 'U': 3 (odd)
   - Output: `YES` (Alice wins)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `5 UDDUD`
   - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
   - Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2 UU`
   - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
   - Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

4. **Edge Case 1**:
   - Input: `1 U`
   - Count of 'U': 1 (odd)
   - Output: `YES` (Alice wins)

5. **Edge Case 2**:
   - Input: `1 D`
   - Count of 'U': 0 (even)
   - Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

6. **Edge Case 3**:
   - Input: `2 UD`
   - Count of 'U': 1 (odd)
   - Output: `YES` (Alice wins)

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the number of 'U' coins. The logic holds for all the provided examples and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**

The program follows the problem description for every potential case and works as expected.
