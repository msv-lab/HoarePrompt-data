Output State: **`data` is a list containing the string representation of `t` followed by the string representations of `n` and `s` for each test case; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`.**

In simpler terms, `t` has been converted from its string representation in `data[0]` to an integer, while `data` remains unchanged.
