The value of `index` is incremented by 2. Therefore, `index` changes from 5 to 7. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `index` is 7, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `s` is `data[6]`, and `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `data[4]`.**
