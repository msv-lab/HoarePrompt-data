### Reasoning:
The provided program follows a straightforward approach to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem statement, Alice and Bob play optimally, and the winner is determined by whether the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) is odd or even:

- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win.

The logic in the program correctly implements this rule by counting the number of `'U'` characters in the string representing the coins for each test case and then checking if this count is odd or even. The output "YES" or "NO" corresponds correctly to Alice's or Bob's win, respectively.

The program reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct result based on the described strategy. No logical errors or incorrect assumptions are present in the code.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
