The code snippet `s = data[index + 1]` changes the value of `s` to the element at the position `index + 1` in the list `data`. Given that `index` is 5, `s` will now hold the value of `data[6]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `index` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`, `s` is `data[6]`, and `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `data[4]`.**
