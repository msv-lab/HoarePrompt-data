The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `s`. Given that `index` is 1, `s` will be assigned the value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is `data[2]`.**

In simpler terms, `s` now holds the value of the third element in the list `data`.
