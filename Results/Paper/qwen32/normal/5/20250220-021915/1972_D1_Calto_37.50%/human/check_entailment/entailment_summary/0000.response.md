### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The output hints confirm this behavior.
   - The code matches the standard implementation of the GCD function.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the given conditions.
   - However, the provided code does not seem to directly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Instead, it calculates an accumulated sum based on a different formula which does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The formula used in `func_2` does not take into account the GCD condition or the pair (a, b) constraints properly.

Given the problem statement, a correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current `func_2` does not follow this logic, and thus, it is unlikely to produce the correct results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Since `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
