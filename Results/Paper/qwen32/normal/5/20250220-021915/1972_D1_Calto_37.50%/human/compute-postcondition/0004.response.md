Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new state of the variables after the code has been executed.

Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1
- `cnt` is 0
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`
- `y` is `i * i`

The code snippet is:
```
cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
```

Impact on the variables:
- `cnt` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1 if `i > 1`, otherwise plus 0.

So, the new value of `cnt` will be `0 + (x // y) + (i > 1)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**
