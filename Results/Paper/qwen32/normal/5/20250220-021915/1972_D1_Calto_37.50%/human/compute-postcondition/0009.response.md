The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.
- `y` is `i * i`.
- `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.

Since only `i` can be adjusted in the loop head, we increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the given information.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`**
