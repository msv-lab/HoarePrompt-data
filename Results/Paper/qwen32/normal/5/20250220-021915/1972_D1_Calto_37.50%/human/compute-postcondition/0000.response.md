The code snippet initializes a new variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` and `m`, which remain positive integers within the specified range. Therefore, the output state is that `n` and `m` retain their initial values, and `cnt` is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is 0.**
