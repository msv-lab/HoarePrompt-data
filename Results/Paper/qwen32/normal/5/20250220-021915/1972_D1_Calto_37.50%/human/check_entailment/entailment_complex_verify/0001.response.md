### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problem and the program to understand why the program is incorrect.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The third condition can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior and the state of the program before and after the function call.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and performs arithmetic operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The logic inside the loop calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\), and then increments the counter `cnt` by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).
   - The final return value depends on whether `cnt` is 0 or not, which does not correctly reflect the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Issues in `func_2(n, m)`:
- The program does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The arithmetic operations performed inside the loop do not correspond to the problem's requirements.
- The return value is based on an incorrect logic that does not count the valid pairs correctly.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using nested loops, but due to the constraints, an optimized approach is required.

Given the original assessment's detailed explanation of the issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
