The value of `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers with `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6` and `m > 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`, the value of `x` will be updated based on this formula. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `i` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**.
