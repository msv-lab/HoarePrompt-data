### Reasoning

Let's re-examine the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - This function is not used in `func_2`, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The logic inside `func_2` does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) and performs some arithmetic operations that do not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the loop in `func_2(n, m)`:
- For each \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\):
  - It calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
  - It increments the counter `cnt` by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).

This loop does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for any pair \((a, b)\). Instead, it performs a fixed arithmetic operation that does not depend on \(a\) and \(b\) directly.

#### Verification Against Function Summary

The function summary provided does not describe the correct logic for solving the problem. It states that the function calculates an accumulated sum based on specific arithmetic operations, but this does not match the problem's requirements.

#### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
