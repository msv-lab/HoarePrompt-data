The code snippet reassigns the value of `x` using the expression `n - (i * i - i)`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `y`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the new value of `x` will be `n - (i * i - i)`. The value of `i` is described as `i + 2`, but since `i` is being used in the calculation of `x`, we use the expression `i + 2` directly in the formula for `x`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is `n - ((i + 2) * (i + 2) - (i + 2))`; `y` is `i * i`; `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`**.
