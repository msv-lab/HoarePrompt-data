Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is `n - ((i + 2) * (i + 2) - (i + 2))`; `y` is `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`; `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the result of `x // y` and `(i > 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
