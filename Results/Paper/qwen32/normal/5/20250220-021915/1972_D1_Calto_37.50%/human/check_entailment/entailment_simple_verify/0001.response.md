### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Let's denote \(g = \gcd(a, b)\). Then, we can write \(a = g \cdot a'\) and \(b = g \cdot b'\), where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\). Substituting these into the condition, we get:
\[ g \cdot a' + g \cdot b' = k \cdot g \cdot b' \cdot g \]
\[ g \cdot (a' + b') = k \cdot g^2 \cdot b' \]
\[ a' + b' = k \cdot g \cdot b' \]

This implies that \(a' + b'\) must be a multiple of \(g \cdot b'\).

#### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program includes two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

Let's examine `func_2(n, m)`:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
- It increments the counter `cnt` by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

The logic in `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The program does not correctly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition. Instead, it performs some arithmetic operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Annotations Analysis
The annotations describe the program's state at key points:
- `func_1(a, b)` correctly calculates the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
- `func_2(n, m)` iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and performs calculations that do not correspond to checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The annotations do not provide any evidence that the program correctly implements the problem's requirements. Instead, they highlight that the program performs incorrect arithmetic operations.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
