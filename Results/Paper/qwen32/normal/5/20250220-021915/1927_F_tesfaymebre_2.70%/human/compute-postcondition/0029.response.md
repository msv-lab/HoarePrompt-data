Functionality: **The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a given vertex `curr` and returns a path that includes a specific node `node_v` if such a path exists. If no such path is found, it returns an empty list. The function uses a list `path` to keep track of the current path and an array `colors` to mark the state of each vertex during the traversal.**
