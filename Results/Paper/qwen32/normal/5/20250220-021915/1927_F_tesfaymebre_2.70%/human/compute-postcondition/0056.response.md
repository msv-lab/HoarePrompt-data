Postcondition: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, with the first tuple removed; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the results of `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively for the next tuple `(w, u, v)` in the list. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, no union operation is performed, and `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` is performed in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new root of the merged set, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_u` is set to `u`, and `node_v` is set to `v`.**
