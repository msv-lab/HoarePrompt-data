The code snippet `dsu.union(u, v, w)` will perform a union operation in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, effectively merging the sets containing nodes `u` and `v`. Given the initial state, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the current roots of the sets containing `u` and `v`, respectively.

After the `union` operation, the DSU structure will be updated to reflect that the sets containing `u` and `v` are now merged. This means that the root of one of the sets will point to the root of the other set, and the rank (or size) of the resulting set might be updated.

However, the specific values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` after the union operation are not directly provided by the operation itself. Instead, they reflect the state of the DSU after the union. The variable `edges` remains unchanged, as the union operation does not modify the list of edges.

Given the information provided, the output state will reflect the updated DSU structure. The exact values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` will depend on the internal implementation of the `dsu.union` method, which typically involves path compression and union by rank. For the sake of this task, we will assume that the union operation has been performed, and the DSU structure is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, with the first tuple removed; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new root of the merged set in the DSU structure after the union operation.**
