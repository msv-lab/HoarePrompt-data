Postcondition: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root parents of nodes `u` and `v` respectively, as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` methods. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` are merged, and the root parent of either `u` or `v` is updated to the root parent of the other node. If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_u` is set to `u`, and `node_v` is set to `v`. Otherwise, these variables remain unchanged.**
