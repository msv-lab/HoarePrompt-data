The code snippet assigns the value of `u` to `node_u`. This means that `node_u` now holds the same value as `u`. The other variables (`edges`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, `_min_edge`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, with the first tuple removed; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new root of the merged set in the DSU structure after the union operation; `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; `node_u` is equal to `u`.**
