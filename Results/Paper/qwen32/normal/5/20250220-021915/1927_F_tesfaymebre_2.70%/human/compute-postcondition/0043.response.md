Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method after the union; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method after the union; `(w, u, v)` is the next edge in the `edges` list; `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; `node_u` is `u`; `node_v` is `v`.**

In this output state, only the variable `node_v` has been updated to the value of `v`. All other variables retain their initial state and values.
