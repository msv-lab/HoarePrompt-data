Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` that meets the conditions (`colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`), `res` is the result returned by the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `set_res` is a set created from the result `res`.**

In natural language: The output state includes all the initial conditions still being valid, with the addition of `set_res` which is a set created from the result `res`.
