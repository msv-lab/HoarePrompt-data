Output State: **The program returns `res`, which is the result of the `dfs` function with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent vertex, and the updated `path`.**

In simple terms, the program returns the result obtained from the recursive call to the `dfs` function, where the next neighbor `nei` is now considered the current vertex, the current vertex `curr` becomes the parent vertex, and the path is updated to include this traversal step.
