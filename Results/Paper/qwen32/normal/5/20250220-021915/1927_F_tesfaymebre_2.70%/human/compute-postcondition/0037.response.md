The loop head in the given `for` loop is `(w, u, v)`, which represents the weight `w` and the two nodes `u` and `v` of an edge. These are the only variables that can be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to identify the next edge in the `edges` list to be processed. Since the `edges` list is sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, the next iteration will process the edge with the next highest weight.

Let's denote the next edge in the `edges` list as `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`. The states of `edges`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` do not need to be adjusted directly for the loop to execute the next iteration. However, we do need to adjust the variables `(w, u, v)` to reflect the next edge in the list.

State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method; `(w, u, v)` is the next edge in the `edges` list, i.e., `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`**

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the state of the other variables remains the same, and we only specify the next edge in the list to be processed.

State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method; `(w, u, v)` is the next edge in the `edges` list**
