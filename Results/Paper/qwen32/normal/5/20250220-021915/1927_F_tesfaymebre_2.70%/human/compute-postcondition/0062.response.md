Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts parameters `n` and `m`, which are integers representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph respectively, with constraints 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5). The function returns a value (or performs an action) based on these inputs, but the specific return value or action is not detailed in the provided information.**
