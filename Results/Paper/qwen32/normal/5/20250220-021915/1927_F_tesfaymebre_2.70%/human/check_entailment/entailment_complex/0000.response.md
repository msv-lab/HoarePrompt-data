### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`).
   - It then reads the edges one by one, storing them in a list (`edges`) and building an adjacency list (`graph`).

2. **Finding a Cycle**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weight.
   - A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to merge components. When an edge connects two vertices that are already in the same component, it means a cycle has been detected.
   - The edge with the minimum weight in this cycle is tracked.

3. **Extracting the Cycle**:
   - Once a cycle is detected, the program performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices of the detected edge to find the full cycle.
   - The DFS function (`dfs`) keeps track of the path and returns the cycle once the target vertex (`node_v`) is found.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

### Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly identifies a cycle using the DSU structure and keeps track of the minimum weight edge in the cycle.
- **Cycle Extraction**: The DFS function (`dfs`) correctly finds the full cycle starting from the detected edge.
- **Output**: The output format matches the problem description, providing the minimum edge weight and the cycle vertices in the correct order.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles input reading, cycle detection, cycle extraction, and output generation accurately.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
