Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr` (an integer representing the current vertex), `parent` (an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal), and `path` (a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal). The function performs a depth-first search and returns the current path taken in the DFS traversal if no specific conditions are met. If a condition is met where the result `res` of a recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)` is not empty and contains the element `node_v`, it returns `res`. If the result `res` of a recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)` is not empty, it returns `res`. If the result `res` is the result of the `dfs` function with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent vertex, and the updated `path`, it returns `res`. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.**
