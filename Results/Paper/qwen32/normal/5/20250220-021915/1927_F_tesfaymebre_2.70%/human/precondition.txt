The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5)) and m (number of edges). Following are m lines, each containing three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
