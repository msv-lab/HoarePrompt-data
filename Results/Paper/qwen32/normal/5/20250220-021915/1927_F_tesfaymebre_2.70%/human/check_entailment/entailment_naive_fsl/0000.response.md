Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge in an undirected weighted graph. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Implementation**: The `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) class is not defined in the provided code, which is crucial for the Kruskal's algorithm part of the solution. Without this class, the program will throw an error.

2. **Incorrect Cycle Detection**: The program attempts to find a cycle by sorting edges in descending order of weight and then using a union-find structure to detect cycles. However, the logic for finding the cycle after detecting a cycle with the minimum weight edge is flawed. The program does not correctly backtrack to find the cycle once it identifies the edge that forms a cycle.

3. **DFS for Cycle Extraction**: The DFS function (`dfs`) is supposed to extract the cycle starting from the node where the cycle was detected, but the implementation is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the backtracking to find the full cycle.

4. **Edge Handling**: The program sorts edges in descending order of weight, but it should be sorted in ascending order to correctly find the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

5. **Cycle Validation**: The program does not validate that the extracted path is indeed a cycle or that it includes the minimum weight edge correctly.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
4 1 4
```
The correct output should be:
```
1 4
1 2 3 4
```
However, the provided program might not correctly identify this cycle or might not handle the edge weights properly.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Sort edges in ascending order of weight**.
2. **Use Kruskal's algorithm** to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) and detect cycles.
3. **Extract the cycle** that includes the minimum weight edge correctly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
