Output State: **The program returns `res` which is the result returned by the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`**

In natural language: The program returns the result of the recursive depth-first search call made with the next neighbor `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent vertex, and the current path `path` which now includes `curr` as its last element.
