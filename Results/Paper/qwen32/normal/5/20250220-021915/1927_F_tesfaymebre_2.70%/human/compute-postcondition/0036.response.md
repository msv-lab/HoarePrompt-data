Postcondition: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are updated to `u` and `v` respectively. Otherwise, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, `parent_u` becomes the root parent of both `u` and `v` (assuming `u`'s set is larger or equal in rank/size), and `parent_v` is updated to point to `parent_u` (or vice versa, depending on the implementation details of the union operation).**
