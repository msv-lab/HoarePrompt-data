The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` method is called, which will union the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` based on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure. This operation typically involves setting the parent of one root to the other, possibly updating ranks or sizes to keep the tree flat.

Given the initial state, the variables `parent_u` and `parent_v` represent the root parents of nodes `u` and `v` respectively. After the union operation, one of these root parents will become the parent of the other, and the specific details depend on the implementation of the `dsu.union` method.

For the sake of this task, we will assume a standard union by rank implementation, where if `parent_u` and `parent_v` are different, the smaller tree (by rank) is attached under the root of the larger tree. If they are the same, one is chosen arbitrarily to be the new root, and its rank is incremented.

Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method after the union; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method after the union; `(w, u, v)` is the next edge in the `edges` list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The `edges` list remains unchanged. The `parent_u` and `parent_v` variables are updated to reflect the new root parents of nodes `u` and `v` after the union operation. The tuple `(w, u, v)` representing the next edge in the `edges` list is also unchanged.
