Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of vertices) and `m` (number of edges).
   - It then reads `m` edges, each consisting of two vertices `u` and `v` and a weight `w`.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list stored in a `defaultdict` named `graph`.
   - The edges are also stored in a list named `edges` with each edge represented as a tuple `(w, u, v)`.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A DSU (also known as Union-Find) data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - The DSU has a method `find` to find the root of a node and a method `union` to union two sets.
   - Each set in the DSU keeps track of the minimum edge weight that connects any two nodes in that set.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and tries to add them to the DSU.
   - If adding an edge forms a cycle (i.e., both endpoints of the edge are already in the same set), it checks if this is the lightest edge seen so far that forms a cycle.
   - It updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in forming this cycle.

6. **Cycle Reconstruction**:
   - After identifying the lightest edge that forms a cycle, the program uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) to reconstruct the cycle starting from one of the endpoints of this edge.
   - The DFS is used to traverse the graph and find the cycle.

7. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program outputs the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then outputs the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Correctness Evaluation

- **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly identifies the lightest edge that forms a cycle by leveraging the DSU data structure.
- **Cycle Reconstruction**: The DFS is used to correctly reconstruct the cycle starting from the identified edge.
- **Output**: The program outputs the correct weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the vertices of the cycle.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently finds a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge and outputs the required information.

**Correctness: True**
