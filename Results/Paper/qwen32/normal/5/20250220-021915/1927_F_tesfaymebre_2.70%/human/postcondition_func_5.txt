The function `func_6` constructs a graph using the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` provided by `func_3()`. It processes the edges to find a specific edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. It then performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes of this edge and prints the minimum weight of the edge and the number of nodes visited during the DFS traversal. Additionally, it prints the nodes visited during the DFS.
