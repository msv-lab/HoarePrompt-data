Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. The current value of `parent_u` is equal to the current value of `parent_v`. The current value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`. `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.**

In simpler terms: The state of `edges`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, and the condition that `parent_u` equals `parent_v` remain unchanged. The value of `_min_edge` is updated to be equal to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.
