Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` is a list containing the integer 0, `eta_ln` is 1, and `j` remains 0. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list, `eta_ln` remains 0, and `j` remains 0. `rho` and `res` are defined based on the conditions given.**
