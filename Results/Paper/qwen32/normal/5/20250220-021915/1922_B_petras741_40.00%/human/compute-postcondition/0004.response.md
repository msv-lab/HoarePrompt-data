The code snippet takes a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `w`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `buffer` are not directly modified by this code snippet.

Given that `n` is the number of integers expected in the input, and `w` is assigned the list of integers from the input, we can describe the output state as follows:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive.**
