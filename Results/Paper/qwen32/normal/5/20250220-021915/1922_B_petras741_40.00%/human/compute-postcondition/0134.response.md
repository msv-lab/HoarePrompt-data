The given code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. However, `eta` is not defined in the initial state, which means we need to assume that `eta` is a list that should be initialized before this operation (likely as an empty list similar to `buffer`).

Given the information, we will assume `eta` is an empty list before this operation. After appending `j` to `eta`, `eta` will contain the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is the previous value incremented by 1, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`.**
