The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is 1. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the single element 0. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
