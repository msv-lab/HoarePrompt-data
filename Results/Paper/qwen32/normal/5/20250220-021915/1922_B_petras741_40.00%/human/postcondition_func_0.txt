The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three distinct indices such that the elements at those indices are the same, considering specific constraints. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases with a total list length not exceeding 300,000 integers.
