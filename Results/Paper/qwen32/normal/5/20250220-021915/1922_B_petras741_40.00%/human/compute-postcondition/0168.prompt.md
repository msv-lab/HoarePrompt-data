Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input value, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, and `buffer` is an empty list. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to n) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the sum of contributions from all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, calculated as described in the loop. If `n` is less than 3, `w` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list or dictionary where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to n) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the sum of contributions from all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is calculated as the sum of the initial `res` value and the terms `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` that have a non-zero count in `q`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the cumulative sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. `res` is defined based on the conditions given: if `eta_ln` is 1, `res` remains as defined; otherwise, `res` includes contributions from `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `i` is incremented by 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is equal to `eta_ln` if `eta_ln` is greater than 1, otherwise `j` remains `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
