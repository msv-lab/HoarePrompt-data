The code snippet `eta.append(j)` adds the variable `j` to the list `eta`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated `eta` list will now include the element `j`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing the element `j`, `eta_ln` is 0, `rho` is not defined, and `q[j]` is greater than 0**.
