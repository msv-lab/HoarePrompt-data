The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has not been specified, but we know it was incremented by 1, so it must have been `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1, `j` is `n`**
