The code snippet `rho += q[eta[j]]` increments the value of `rho` by the value of `q[eta[j]]`. 

Given that `j` is initially 1, this means `rho` is incremented by the count of the integer at `eta[1]` in the list `w`.

Let's update the value of `rho` accordingly:
- `rho` was initially `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho`
- Now `rho` becomes `rho + q[eta[1]]`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` that have a non-zero count in `q`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `rho` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[1]]`**
