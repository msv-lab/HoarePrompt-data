The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means `n` is reassigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`nums`, `curr`, `last`, `t`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is the original list of integers, `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**
