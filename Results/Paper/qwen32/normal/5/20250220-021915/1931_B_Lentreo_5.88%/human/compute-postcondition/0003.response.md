The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. 

Given the initial state, `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` remains an input integer. The new variable `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
