The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over `nums`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `nums` for the loop to execute one more time. The other variables (`nums`, `curr`, and `last`) are not part of the loop head, so we do not adjust them.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the next element in `nums`.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.

We need to move `i` to the next element in `nums` for the next iteration. Let's assume that the current `i` is at index `k` in `nums`. For the next iteration, `i` will be at index `k+1`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the element at index `k+1` in `nums`**.

Since the exact value of `i` and the relationship with `curr` and `last` are not specified for the next iteration, we only need to adjust `i` to the next element in the list `nums`. The values of `curr` and `last` remain as they are unless they are explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in `nums`**.
