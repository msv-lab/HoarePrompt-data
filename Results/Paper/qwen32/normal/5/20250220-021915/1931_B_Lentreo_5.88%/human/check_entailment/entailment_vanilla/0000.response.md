Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if we can make all the containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The total amount of water is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers.

### Key Insight:
For it to be possible to equalize the water in all containers, we need to ensure that at each step, we can pour water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones, ultimately achieving a uniform distribution of water. Given the constraints and the operation allowed, the problem can be simplified by checking if the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the last container's water level is balanced out.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list of water amounts and calculating the cumulative difference between each container's water amount and the last container's water amount. If this cumulative difference is zero, the program outputs "YES", indicating that it's possible to equalize the water levels. Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

However, there are several issues with the provided program:
1. The program incorrectly calculates the cumulative difference. It initializes `curr` to 0 and then iterates through the list `nums`. For each element `i` in `nums`, it adds `i - last` to `curr`. The variable `last` is set to `nums[-1]` before the loop starts, and it never changes. This means that the program is actually checking the difference between each element and the last element, which is not the correct approach to determine if we can equalize the water levels.

2. The logic of the program is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the process of pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones. The correct approach would involve ensuring that the cumulative water amount up to each container (after adjusting for the average) is balanced.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Calculate the target water level for each container, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers.
2. Iterate through the list of water amounts and keep a running total of the difference between the current cumulative water amount and the expected cumulative water amount (i.e., the target water level times the number of containers seen so far).
3. If the running total of this difference is zero at the end of the iteration, it means we can equalize the water levels. Otherwise, we cannot.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Reasoning: The provided program incorrectly calculates the cumulative difference and does not correctly simulate the process of pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones.
Correctness: **False**
