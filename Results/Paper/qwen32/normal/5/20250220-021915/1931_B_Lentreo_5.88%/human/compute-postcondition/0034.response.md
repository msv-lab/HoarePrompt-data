The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `nums` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the next element in `nums`, and `last` was the previous element in `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be updated to the next element in `nums`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element being processed, and `last` was the previous element.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be updated to the next element in the list `nums`.
- `last` is not part of the loop head and should not be modified here.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`, `last` is the previous element in `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**.

Since `i` needs to be the next element in `nums` for the next iteration, we will denote this new element as the next item in the sequence. Assuming `nums` has at least one more element after the current `i`, the new state should reflect that `i` is now the next element in the list.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums` (after the current `i`), `last` is the previous element in `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**.

To make it more concrete, if `nums` was `[a, b, c, d]` and `i` was `b` and `last` was `a` after the first iteration, the next state would be `i` is `c` and `last` remains `b` (but `last` is not part of the loop head adjustment).

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**. 

Since we don't have the exact values, we can generalize that `i` is updated to the subsequent element in `nums`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**. 

However, to be more precise in reflecting the change in `i`:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums` (the element after the current `i`). If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, and it needs to be the next element in `nums`:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**.

Final State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`.**
