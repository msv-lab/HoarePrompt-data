### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic of the program is flawed, and it does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`. 

2. **Key Insight**: For this to be possible, the total amount of water divided by the number of containers `n` should be the target amount of water in each container. Let's call this `target = sum(a) / n`. The problem states that `sum(a)` is divisible by `n`, so `target` will be an integer.

3. **Operation Constraint**: The operation allows pouring water only from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index. This means that water can only flow from left to right.

4. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach would be to check if, starting from the leftmost container, we can always pour water to the right in a way that eventually all containers have the `target` amount of water. This can be done by maintaining a running total of the difference between the current amount of water and the target as we move from left to right. If at any point this running total becomes negative, it means we cannot balance the water using the allowed operation.

5. **Program Analysis**: The provided program incorrectly calculates `curr` as the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element. This does not correctly reflect the logic needed to determine if the water can be evenly distributed according to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It incorrectly calculates `curr` and checks if it equals zero, which is not a valid condition for determining if the water can be evenly distributed.

### Correctness: **False**
