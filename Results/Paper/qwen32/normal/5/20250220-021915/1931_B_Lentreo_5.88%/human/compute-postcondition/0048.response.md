In the given for loop, the loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the list `nums`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `nums` and `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is used to iterate over each element in the `nums` list. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be set to any specific value because it is assigned the first element of `nums` during the first iteration of the loop.

2. **List `nums`**: The loop will execute if `nums` is not empty. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given this, to ensure that the loop executes, `nums` must contain at least one element. The values of `curr`, `last`, `t`, and `n` are not relevant to the execution of the loop and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`nums` is the list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `curr` is 0; `last` is the last element of `nums`; `t` is unchanged; `n` is an input integer**.

However, strictly adhering to the requirement to only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we only need to ensure `nums` has at least one element.

State: **`nums` is the list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element**.
