Postcondition: **`ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. `x` is at least 4 if `x` is even or at least 1 if `x` is odd. `n` is any value. `k` is `x // n`. The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is `[1, i]`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `l` remains unchanged.**
