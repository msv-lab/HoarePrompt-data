Let's break down the given task step-by-step:

**Initial State:**
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is the result of the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `x // n`).

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print(1)
```

**Analysis:**
- The `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer `1`.
- The variables `x`, `n`, and `k` are defined based on the input but are not used in the `print` statement.
- Since the `print` statement is independent of these variables, their values do not affect the output.

**Conclusion:**
The `print` statement will output the number `1`.

**Output:**
Output: **1**
