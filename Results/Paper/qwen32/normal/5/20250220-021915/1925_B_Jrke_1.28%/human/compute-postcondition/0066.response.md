The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `l` originally contained only `ans`, after the append operation, `l` will contain two elements: `ans` and `i`. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing `ans` and `i`.**
