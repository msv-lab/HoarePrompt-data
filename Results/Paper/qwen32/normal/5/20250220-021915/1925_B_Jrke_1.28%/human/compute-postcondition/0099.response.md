Postcondition: **`ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. `x` is at least 4 if `x` is even or at least 1 if `x` is odd. `n` is any value. `k` is `x // n`. The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`. `i` is `i + 2` where `i + 2` is less than or equal to `int(x)`. If `x % i == 0`, then if `x // i <= k`, `l` is `[ans, i, x // i]`. Otherwise, `l` is `[ans]`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` remains `[ans]`.**
