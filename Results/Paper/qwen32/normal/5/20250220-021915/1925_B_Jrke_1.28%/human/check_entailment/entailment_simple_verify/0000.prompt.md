You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:

    for _ in range(int(input())):

            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x`.
- The goal is to maximize the balance, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum possible GCD of `n` sub-problems that sum up to `x`.

### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Read Input:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Initial Calculation:** It calculates `k` as `x // n`, which is the integer division of `x` by `n`.
3. **Edge Case Handling:** If `k` is 1, it immediately prints 1 because the maximum GCD when the average difficulty is 1 is 1.
4. **Finding Maximum GCD:** The program iterates through possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the maximum GCD that can be achieved by splitting `x` into `n` parts.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Correctness of GCD Calculation:** The program seems to be correctly calculating the GCD by checking divisors of `x` and ensuring they are less than or equal to `k`.
2. **Edge Cases:** The program handles the edge case where `k` is 1 correctly by printing 1.
3. **General Case Handling:** The program appears to handle the general case by iterating through divisors and checking if they can be used to form sub-problems.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example and some additional edge cases to ensure it works correctly.

#### Provided Example:
```
Input:
3
10 3
5 5
420 69

Output:
2
1
6
```
The program correctly produces the expected output for the provided example.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **x = n:** When `x` equals `n`, the only way to split `x` into `n` parts is to have each part with difficulty 1, so the GCD should be 1.
2. **x is Prime and n = 1:** When `x` is a prime number and `n` is 1, the only sub-problem is the problem itself, so the GCD is `x`.
3. **x is a Power of a Prime:** When `x` is a power of a prime, the GCD should be the prime number itself if `n` is less than or equal to the power.

Let's test these edge cases.

### Testing with Edge Cases:
1. **x = n:**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   5 5

   Expected Output:
   1

   Actual Output:
   1
   ```

2. **x is Prime and n = 1:**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   7 1

   Expected Output:
   7

   Actual Output:
   7
   ```

3. **x is a Power of a Prime:**
   ```
   Input:
   1
   8 2

   Expected Output:
   4

   Actual Output:
   4
   ```

### Conclusion:
The program passes all the provided examples and additional edge cases correctly. There are no apparent issues with the logic used to calculate the maximum GCD.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum GCD for each test case by iterating through possible divisors of `x` and ensuring they can form `n` sub-problems with the required sum. It handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1, when `x` is a prime number and `n` is 1, and when `x` is a power of a prime.
