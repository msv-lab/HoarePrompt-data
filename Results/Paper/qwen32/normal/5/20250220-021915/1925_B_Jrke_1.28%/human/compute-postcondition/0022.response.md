Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`. If `i` <= `k`, then `i` is increased by 2 and the new value of `i` is added to the list `l`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.**
