The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `l`. Given that the initial state specifies `l` is `[1]`, after appending `i`, `l` will be `[1, i]`.

The other variables (`x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `x % i == 0`, and the condition that `i` is less than or equal to `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `append` operation.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i == 0`, `l` is `[1, i]`, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
