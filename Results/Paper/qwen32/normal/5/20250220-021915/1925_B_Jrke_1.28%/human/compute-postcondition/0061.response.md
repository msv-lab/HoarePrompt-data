Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is updated based on conditions involving `i` and `x // i`, `i` is incremented by 2, and `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `i`.**
