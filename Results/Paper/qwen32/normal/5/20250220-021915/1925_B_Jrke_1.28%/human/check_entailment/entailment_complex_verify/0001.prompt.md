You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = x // n
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: ans is the maximum value among 1, all odd divisors of x that are less than or equal to k, and their corresponding quotients x // i that are also less than or equal to k for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum value among 1, all odd divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `x // n`, and their corresponding quotients `x // i` that are also less than or equal to `x // n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` positive integers such that their sum equals `x`. The key is to understand how to distribute the difficulty `x` among `n` sub-problems to maximize the GCD.

### Observations
1. **Minimum GCD**: The minimum possible GCD is `1` because we can always break `x` into `n` parts of `1` if `x >= n`.
2. **Maximum GCD**: The maximum possible GCD is `x // n` because the GCD cannot be greater than the smallest number in the set, and the smallest number we can have if we distribute `x` as evenly as possible is `x // n`.
3. **Finding the GCD**: To maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.

### Program Analysis
The given program attempts to find the maximum possible GCD by iterating over the divisors of `x` and checking if they can be the GCD of the sub-problems. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Initial Check**: If `k = x // n` is `1`, the program immediately prints `1` because the smallest possible sub-problem difficulty is `1`, and thus the maximum GCD is `1`.
3. **Finding Divisors**: The program iterates over the odd divisors of `x` starting from `1` (or `2` if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` (the corresponding pair divisor) can be the GCD by ensuring they are less than or equal to `k`.
4. **Updating the GCD**: It keeps track of the maximum valid divisor found during the iteration and prints it as the result.

### Correctness Verification
- **Handling Small GCDs**: The program correctly handles cases where the maximum GCD is `1` by checking if `k` is `1`.
- **Finding Divisors**: The program iterates over potential divisors and checks if they can be the GCD, which is a valid approach.
- **Efficiency**: The program only iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible GCD of the sub-problems. It efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
