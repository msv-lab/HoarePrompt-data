The code snippet creates a list `l` and assigns it the value `[ans]`. The variables `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` are not modified by this code. Therefore, their initial states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i == 0`, `l` is `[1]`.**
