The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to defeat all `n` monsters using the given health values and positions within the constraints of the available time. It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated without exceeding the time available for each monster, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
