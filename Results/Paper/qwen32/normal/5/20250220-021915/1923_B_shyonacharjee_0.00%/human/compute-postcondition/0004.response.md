The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into separate string values, converts each of those string values to an integer, and then stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `positions`. 

The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `healths` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `positions` is newly introduced and assigned a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
