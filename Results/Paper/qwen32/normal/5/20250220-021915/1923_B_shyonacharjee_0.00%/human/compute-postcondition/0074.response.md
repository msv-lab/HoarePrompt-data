To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- `success` is a boolean variable that is `True` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `False`.
- The `print` statement uses a conditional expression to print 'YES' if `success` is `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Since the value of `success` is not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output based on the condition given in the code snippet.

Output: **YES if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise NO**.
