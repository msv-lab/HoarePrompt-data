The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` by reading an input line, splitting it into two parts, and converting each part to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, but `t` is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer.**
