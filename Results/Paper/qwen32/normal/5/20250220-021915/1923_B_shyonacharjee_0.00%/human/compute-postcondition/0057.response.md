Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input (updated), `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`, `i` is `i` + 1, `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple of `monsters`, `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple of `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`**.

In this output state, the variable `distance` has been added and is set to the absolute value of `position`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
