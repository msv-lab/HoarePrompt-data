Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input (updated), `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the previous `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`, `i` is `i` + 1, `position` is the first element of `monsters[i]`, `health` is the second element of `monsters[i]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without changing `success`.**
