Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `x` of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs. Specifically, it handles `t` test cases where each test case involves checking conditions related to the lists `a` and `x` and the integer `k`. If the conditions are met, it computes and returns a specific value; otherwise, it returns a different value. The exact computation depends on the logic within the function, but it processes each test case independently.**
