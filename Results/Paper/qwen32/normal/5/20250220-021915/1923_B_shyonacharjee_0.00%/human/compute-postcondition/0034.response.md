Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is `2 * health`, `i` is 2, `position` is the third position from the `monsters` list, `health` is the third health value from the `monsters` list, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `abs(position)`, `bullets_needed` is the third health value from the `monsters` list. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
