To determine the output, let's break down the given information and the code execution step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`.
- `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2] + T[n-1].
- `i` is `n`.
- `result` is a string that is the space-separated representation of the list `a`.

### Execution Process:
1. **Input Parsing**: The input string `line` is split into a list of integers `T`.
2. **List `a` Construction**:
   - The first element of `a` is 1000.
   - The second element of `a` is 1000 + T[0].
   - The third element of `a` is 1000 + T[0] + T[1].
   - This pattern continues until the nth element of `a`, which is 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-1].
3. **String `result` Construction**:
   - The list `a` is converted into a space-separated string `result`.

### Output:
The `print(result)` statement will output the space-separated string representation of the list `a`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `result` is dynamically determined based on the input list `T` and the integer `n`.
- Since the exact values of `T` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values in the list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we know that the print statement will output the space-separated string representation of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the space-separated representation of the list `a`, with `a` being constructed as described above)**
