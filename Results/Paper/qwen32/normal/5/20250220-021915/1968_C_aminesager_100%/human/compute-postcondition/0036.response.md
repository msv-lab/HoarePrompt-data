Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the new input string `line`, `a` is a list `[1000]`, `i` is n, `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`, `line` is the new input string.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been updated to be a list containing only the value `1000`. All other variables retain their initial values.
