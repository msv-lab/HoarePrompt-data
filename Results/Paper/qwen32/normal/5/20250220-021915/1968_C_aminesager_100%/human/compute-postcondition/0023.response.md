The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new value to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which is 1000, and `T[i - 1]` is `T[0]`, which is the first element of the list `T`. Therefore, the new value being appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `1000 + T[0]`, `i` is 1, `result` is a string that is the space-separated representation of the list `a`, `line` is the input string.**
