The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the new input string `line`, `a` is a list `[1000, 1000 + T[-1], 1000 + T[0]]`, `i` is 2, `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`, `line` is the new input string**
