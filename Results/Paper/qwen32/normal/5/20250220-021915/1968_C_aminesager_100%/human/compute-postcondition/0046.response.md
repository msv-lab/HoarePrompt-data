Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer from the last test case input, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the last input string `line`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2] + T[n-1], `i` is `n`, `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The variable `n` will hold the value of the integer from the last test case input. The list `T` will contain the integers from the last input string `line`, and the list `a` will be computed as specified, containing cumulative sums starting from 1000. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and `result` will be a space-separated string of the list `a`.
