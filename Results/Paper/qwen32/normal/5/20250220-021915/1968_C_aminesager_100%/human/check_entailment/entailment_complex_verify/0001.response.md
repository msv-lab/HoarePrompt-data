Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the program correctly satisfies the problem requirements.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The array `a` is initialized with the first element as `1000`.
   - This satisfies the condition \( 1 \le a_1 \le 10^9 \).

2. **Construction of Subsequent Elements**:
   - For each subsequent element \( a_i \) (for \( i \ge 2 \)), it is constructed as \( a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \).
   - Since both \( a_{i-1} \) and \( x_{i-1} \) are non-negative and \( x_{i-1} \le 500 \), the constructed \( a_i \) will indeed be within the range \( [1, 10^9] \).

3. **Verification of Modulo Condition**:
   - The condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) needs to be verified.
   - By construction, \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \), so:
     \[
     a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}
     \]
   - This implies \( x_i = x_{i-1} \), which is not necessarily true according to the problem statement. The problem requires \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), but the program constructs \( a_i \) in a way that \( x_{i-1} = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), which is not the same as \( x_i \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \). The program actually ensures that \( x_{i-1} = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), which is not what the problem requires.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
