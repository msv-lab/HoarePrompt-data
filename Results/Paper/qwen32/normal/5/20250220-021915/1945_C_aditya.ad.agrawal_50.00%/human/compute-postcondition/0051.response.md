To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State Breakdown:**
   - `t > 0`: This indicates that `t` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `a` remains unchanged (its value is not specified here).
   - `input_string` is the string input by the user.
   - `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`.
   - `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`.
   - `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.
   - `z_r` is initialized to 0.
   - `o_r` is initialized to 0.
   - `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr` (same as `z`).
   - `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr` (same as `o`).
   - `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.
   - `ans` is the position where certain conditions were met or 0.
   - `pos` is `len(arr)`.
   - `b_d` is the minimum `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where conditions were met or 30001.

2. **Relevant Variable for the Print Statement:**
   - `ans` is the variable that will be printed. According to the description, `ans` is the position where certain conditions were met or 0.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The value of `ans` is not explicitly calculated in the provided initial state, but it is described as the position where certain conditions were met or 0.
   - Since there is no information provided about the conditions that were met or the position where they were met, the most precise description we can give is that `ans` is either 0 or the position where the conditions were met.

Based on the given information, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the value of `ans`, which is either 0 or the position where the conditions were met.

Output: **ans (where ans is either 0 or the position where the conditions were met)**
