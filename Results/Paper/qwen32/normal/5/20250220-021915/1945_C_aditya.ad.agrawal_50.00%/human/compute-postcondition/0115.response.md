The code sets `b_d` to 30001. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `b_d` is 30001.**
