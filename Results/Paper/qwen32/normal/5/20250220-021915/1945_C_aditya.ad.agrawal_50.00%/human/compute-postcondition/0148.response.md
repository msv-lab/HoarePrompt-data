The code snippet provided updates the value of `b_d` to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. No other variables are directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`. If `i == 0`, `z_l` is `z_l + 1` and `z_r` is `z_r - 1`. If `i != 0`, `o_l` is `o_l + 1` and `o_r` is `o_r - 1`. `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. `ans` is `pos`. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
