Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`.**

In this output state, the variable `z_r` has been assigned the value of `z`, which is the count of 0s in the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
