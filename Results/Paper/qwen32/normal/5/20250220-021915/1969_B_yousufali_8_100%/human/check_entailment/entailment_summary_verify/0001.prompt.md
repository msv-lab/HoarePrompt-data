You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The overall effect is determined by the actions performed within `func_1`, which is not detailed here.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of cyclically shifting a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations

1. **Sorted String**: A binary string is sorted if all 0s are at the beginning and all 1s are at the end.
2. **Cost Calculation**: To sort the string, we need to move all 1s to the right of all 0s. Each time we encounter a '0' after some '1's, we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring that '0' to the front of the '1's. The cost of such a shift depends on the number of '1's encountered so far.

### Algorithm Explanation

The provided program seems to implement the following logic:
- It iterates through each character of the string.
- It keeps a count of the number of '1's encountered so far (`n`).
- Whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the given examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "10"`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 1`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's, so no cost is added.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 1`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 2`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 1`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 2`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 3`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 4`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 1`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 2`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 3`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 4`
   - Output: `11` (Correct)
