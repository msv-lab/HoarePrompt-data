### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described operations.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `s` is the binary string read from input.
   - `n` is initialized to 0 and will keep track of the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0 and will accumulate the total cost.

2. **Loop through the string**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', increment `n` by 1.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0 (meaning there have been '1's before this '0'), add `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost `n + 1` is added to `ans` whenever a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's. This cost corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed to move the '1's before this '0' to the right of this '0'. Each '1' encountered before a '0' needs to be shifted at least once, and the additional `+1` accounts for the operation itself.

This logic is based on the intuition that each '0' encountered after a '1' requires shifting all the preceding '1's to the right of that '0'. The cost for each such shift is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one for the operation itself.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `n` becomes 1 after reading '1'.
   - When '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's are encountered, so `ans` remains 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - `n` becomes 2 after reading "11".
   - When the first '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When the second '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `3 + 3 = 6`.
   - When the third '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `6 + 4 = 10`.
   - Output: `9` (Incorrect, the provided example says 9, but the logic suggests 10. This discrepancy needs further inspection.)

4. **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - `n` becomes 1 after reading '1'.
   - When the first '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` becomes 2 after reading the next '1'.
   - When the second '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `2 + 3 = 5`.
   - `n` becomes 3 after reading the next '1'.
   - `n` becomes 4 after reading the next '1'.
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - `n` becomes 1 after reading '1'.
   - When the first '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` becomes 2 after reading the next '1'.
   - When the second '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `2 + 3 = 5`.
   - `n` becomes 3 after reading the next '1'.
   - When the third '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `5 + 4 = 9`.
   - `n` becomes 4 after reading the next '1'.
   - When the fourth '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes `9 + 5 = 14`.
   - Output: `11` (Incorrect, the provided example says 11, but the logic suggests 14. This discrepancy needs further inspection.)

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all test cases. Specifically, the cost calculation for multiple '0's after '1's seems incorrect. The discrepancies in the provided examples suggest that the logic needs refinement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
