The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` are not changed by this line of code. 

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `s[i]` is '1', then `n` is also incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`.**
