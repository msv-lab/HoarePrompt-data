Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from standard input and returns a value based on the input. If the input is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If the input is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".**
