To determine the output state, we need to know the definition of `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine how it affects the variable `t` or any other variables. Therefore, based on the information given, we can only assume that `func_1()` does not affect the variable `t` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 2**.
