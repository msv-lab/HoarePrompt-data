Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by using the defined operations. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
    - It reads a binary string `s`.
    - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
    - It iterates through each character in the string:
        - If the character is '1', it increments the `n` counter.
        - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero (meaning there are '1's before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. The `n + 1` represents the cost of shifting the substring that includes the current '0' and all the preceding '1's to the right of it, making the '0' come before the '1's.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to compute the minimum cost for that particular test case.

The logic effectively computes the minimum cost by considering each '0' that appears after one or more '1's and calculates the cost of shifting the substring containing those '1's and the '0' to the right. This ensures that all '1's are eventually moved to the end of the string, resulting in a sorted string.

Therefore, the program is correct.
