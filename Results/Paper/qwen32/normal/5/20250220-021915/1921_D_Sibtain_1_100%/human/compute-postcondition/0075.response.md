The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it. The values of `t1` and `t2` are already defined based on the initial state. The code does not modify `t1`, `t2`, `i`, `j`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `c`. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `j` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `j` is either 1 or 2 based on the initial comparison between `t1` and `t2` and `i` is incremented by 1. `t2` is updated to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**
