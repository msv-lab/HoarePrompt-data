The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of 1; `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, no further changes are made to the variables.**
