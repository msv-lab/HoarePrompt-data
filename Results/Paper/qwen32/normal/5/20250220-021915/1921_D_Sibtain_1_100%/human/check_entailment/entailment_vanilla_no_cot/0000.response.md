Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum total difference \(D\) for all test cases. Specifically, the approach used to determine the maximum difference by alternating between the smallest and largest elements in the sorted arrays \(a\) and \(c\) does not guarantee the optimal solution.

The correct strategy to maximize \(D\) is to pair the smallest elements of \(a\) with the largest elements of \(c\) and the largest elements of \(a\) with the smallest elements of \(c\). This ensures that the absolute differences are maximized.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        c.sort()
        
        # Assign the smallest a with the largest c and vice versa
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            ans += max(abs(a[i] - c[m - 1 - i]), abs(a[n - 1 - i] - c[i]))
        
        print(ans)

# Example usage
func()
```

This version of the program sorts both arrays and then calculates the maximum possible difference by pairing the smallest elements of \(a\) with the largest elements of \(c\) and vice versa. This ensures the maximum total difference \(D\) is achieved.
