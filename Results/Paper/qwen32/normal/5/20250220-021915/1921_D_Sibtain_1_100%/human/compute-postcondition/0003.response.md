The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `c` is a list of integers read from input.**
