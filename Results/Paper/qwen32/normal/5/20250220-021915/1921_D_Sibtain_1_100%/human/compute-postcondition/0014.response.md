Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input; `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order. If `a` has a length of 1, then the condition is checked to see if all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`. Otherwise, no further changes are made to the variables. `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` have been initialized to 0, 1, and 0 respectively. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`) retain their initial values and conditions.
