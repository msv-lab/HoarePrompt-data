The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Based on the initial state provided, the value of `j` is either 2 or 3 if `t2 > t1`, or 1 or 2 otherwise. After the increment, `j` will be 3 or 4 if it was initially 2 or 3, respectively, or `j` will be 2 or 3 if it was initially 1 or 2, respectively.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `j` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `j` is either 2 or 3 based on the initial comparison between `t1` and `t2` and `i` is incremented by 1. `t2` is updated to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**
