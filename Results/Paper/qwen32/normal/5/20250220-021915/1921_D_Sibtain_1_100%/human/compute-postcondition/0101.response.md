Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `t1` to be the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t2`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from the initial state.
