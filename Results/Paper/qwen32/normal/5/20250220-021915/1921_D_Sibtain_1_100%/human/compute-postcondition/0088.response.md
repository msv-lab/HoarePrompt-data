Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the final value after all comparisons, `j` is the final value after all comparisons. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and `a[0]` equals `c[0]`, then the condition is satisfied, otherwise no specific changes are made to the variables described.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no other changes are made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
