The code calculates the absolute difference between the first elements of the sorted list `a` and the list `c` sorted in descending order, and assigns this value to `t1`. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1; `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order; `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`**.
