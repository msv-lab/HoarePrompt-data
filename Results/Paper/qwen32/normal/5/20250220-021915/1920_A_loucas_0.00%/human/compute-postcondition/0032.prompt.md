Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the single element `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is any other value, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `loop` is greater than 0; `iterable` is 0; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is greater than 0; `x` is the first integer from the new input; `a` is the second integer from the new input; `iterable2` is 1. If the new `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the old input and `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If the new `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a` and `big` is a list containing the second integer from the new input if the old `x` was 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list. If the new `x` is any other value, `no` contains the value of `a` and possibly other elements based on the previous value of `x`, and `big` and `less` are lists based on the previous value of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `loop` is greater than 0; `iterable` is 0; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is greater than 0; `x` is the first integer from the new input; `a` is the second integer from the new input; `iterable2` is 2. If `x` is 1, `big` is updated to include `a` at the end of the list, and `less` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a` appended to it, and `big` and `no` are lists based on the previous value of `x`. If `x` is any other value, `no` contains the value of `a` and possibly other elements based on the previous value of `x`, and `big` and `less` are lists based on the previous value of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
