To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`big`**: This is a list or collection of values.
2. **`less`**: This is another list or collection of values.
3. **`no`**: This is a list or collection of values that should not be included in the range.
4. **`num`**: This variable is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` (inclusive of `max(big)` and exclusive of `min(less)`) that is not in `no`.

### Steps to Determine `num`:
1. **Find `max(big)`**: This will be the starting point of the range.
2. **Find `min(less) - 1`**: This will be the endpoint of the range (exclusive).
3. **Iterate through the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`**: Check each value `i` to see if it is not in the list `no`.
4. **Set `num` to the first value `i` that is not in `no`**.

### Explanation of the Output:
The `print(num)` statement will print the first value `i` in the specified range that is not present in the list `no`.

Since the exact values of `big`, `less`, and `no` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `num`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **num (where num is the first value in the range from max(big) to min(less) - 1 that is not in no)**
