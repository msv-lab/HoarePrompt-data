The code snippet initializes a new empty list called `big`. The other variables (`t`, `loop`, `iterable`, and `less`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list.**
