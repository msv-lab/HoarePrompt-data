The code snippet `innerLoop = int(input())` assigns the value of `innerLoop` to whatever integer is input by the user. The other variables (`num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `big`, `less`, `no`, and `iterable2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration.**

In natural language: The value of `innerLoop` is set to an integer input by the user. All other variables retain their initial values.
