The code snippet creates a new empty list named `no`. The other variables (`t`, `loop`, `iterable`, `less`, `big`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**
