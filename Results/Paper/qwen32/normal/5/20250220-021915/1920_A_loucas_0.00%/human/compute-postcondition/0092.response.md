Postcondition: **`num` is `i` if `i` is not in `no`; otherwise, `num` remains 0. `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `loop` is unchanged. `innerLoop` is greater than 0. `big` is a list with at least one element. `less` is a list with at least one element where `min(less) > max(big)`. `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2. `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration. `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `no`, the most internal loop is broken out of.**
