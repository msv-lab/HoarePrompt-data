To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `big`, and `less`. From the description, the loop iterates from `max(big)` to `min(less)`, and `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value.
- `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- The value of `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- The values of `big` and `less` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_current`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_current + 1`.

State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to make it more precise, if `i` was `i_current` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_current + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i_current + 1`**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `i_current`, we can express it generally as:
State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
