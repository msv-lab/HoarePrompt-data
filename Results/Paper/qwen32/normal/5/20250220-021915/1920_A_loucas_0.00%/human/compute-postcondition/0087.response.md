Output State: **`num` is `i`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element where `min(less) > max(big)`, `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
