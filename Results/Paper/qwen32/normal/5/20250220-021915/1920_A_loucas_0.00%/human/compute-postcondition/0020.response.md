The given code snippet appends the value of `a` to the `big` list. This means that the `big` list will now contain the second integer from the old input as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `loop` is greater than 0; `iterable` is 0; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is greater than 0; `x` is the first integer from the new input; `a` is the second integer from the new input; if the old `x` was 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the old input and `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists; if the old `x` was 2, `less` is a list containing the single element `a` from the old input, and `big` is a list containing the second integer from the new input, and `no` is an empty list; if the old `x` was any other value, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` from the old input and the second integer from the new input, and `big` and `less` are empty lists; `iterable2` is 1.**
