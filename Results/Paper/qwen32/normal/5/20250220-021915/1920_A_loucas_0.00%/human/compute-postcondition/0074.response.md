The code snippet `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. 

Given the initial state:
- `num` is 0
- `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration
- `loop` is unchanged
- `innerLoop` is greater than 0
- `x` is the first integer from the input
- `a` is the second integer from the input
- `big` is a list containing `a` twice if `x` is 1, or `big` is a list containing `a` once if `x` is not 1
- `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is not 2, or `less` is a list containing `a` twice if `x` is 2
- `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1 or 2, and `no` contains `a` twice if `x` is not 1 or 2
- `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration

After executing `big.append(a)`, the list `big` will have an additional element `a` appended to it. 

If `x` was 1, `big` initially contained `[a, a]`, and after the append, it will contain `[a, a, a]`.
If `x` was not 1, `big` initially contained `[a]`, and after the append, it will contain `[a, a]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `big` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` is 1, or `big` is a list containing `a` twice if `x` is not 1, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is not 2, or `less` is a list containing `a` twice if `x` is 2, `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1 or 2, and `no` contains `a` twice if `x` is not 1 or 2, `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
