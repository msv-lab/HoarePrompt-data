Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: 
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `num` and the flow continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is set to `i + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to the previous value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `no`, `num` is not set and the loop or if statement does not break.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
