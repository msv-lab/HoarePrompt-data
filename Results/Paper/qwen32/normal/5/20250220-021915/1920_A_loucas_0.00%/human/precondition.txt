t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9; a=1 means k must be greater than or equal to x; a=2 means k must be less than or equal to x; a=3 means k must be not equal to x; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; no two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
