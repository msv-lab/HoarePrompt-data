Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m`, or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even, as specified in the else part.**
