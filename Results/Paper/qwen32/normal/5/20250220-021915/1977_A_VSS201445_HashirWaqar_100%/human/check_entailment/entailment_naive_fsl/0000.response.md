Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower in one move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Operations**: Each move can either add or remove 1 cube.
3. **Goal**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.
4. **Constraints**: `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

### Conditions for a Valid Solution:
- **Parity Check**: Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes (`n - m`) must be even. This is because an even number of moves (additions and/or subtractions) is required to reach an even difference.
- **Non-Negative Cubes**: The number of cubes `m` must be non-negative, which is inherently satisfied since `m` is at least 1.
- **Feasibility**: The number of cubes `m` must be reachable within `n` moves, which means `m` should not exceed `n` (since we can't remove more cubes than we have).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check:
- **Condition 1**: `n >= m` ensures that we do not attempt to remove more cubes than we have.
- **Condition 2**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the number of moves required to reach `m` cubes is feasible given the constraints.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input**: `3 3`
   - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True
   - **Output**: "YES" (Correct)
   
2. **Input**: `2 4`
   - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n >= m` is False
   - **Output**: "NO" (Correct)
   
3. **Input**: `5 3`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True
   - **Output**: "YES" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, which are the necessary conditions for the problem. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is correct for all valid inputs.
