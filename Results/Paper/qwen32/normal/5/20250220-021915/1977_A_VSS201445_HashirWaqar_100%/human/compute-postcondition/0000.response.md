In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range determined by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by the input, which represents the number of iterations (`t`).

Let's break down the requirements:
- The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop head and does not need to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts.

Given the loop statement:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The only state we can adjust is the input value, which determines the number of iterations. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, we need to ensure that the input to the `int(input())` function is within this range.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input value `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and the input to the `int(input())` function must be `t`**
