The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.

Based on the initial state provided, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are described but are not directly used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will simply be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
