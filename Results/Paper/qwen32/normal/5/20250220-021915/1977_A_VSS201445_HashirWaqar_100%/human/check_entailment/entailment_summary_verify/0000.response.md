### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from 0 cubes.
- Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- The number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` are integers between 1 and 100.

#### Conditions for a Valid Solution:
1. **Parity Check**: The difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes (`n - m`) must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, so an even number of moves is required to reach an even difference.
2. **Feasibility**: The number of cubes `m` must be reachable within `n` moves, which means `m` should not exceed `n` (since we can't remove more cubes than we have).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks two conditions:
1. `n >= m`: This ensures that we do not attempt to remove more cubes than we have.
2. `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the number of moves required to reach `m` cubes is feasible given the constraints.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it prints "YES" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Validation Against Problem Description:
- **Condition 1**: `n >= m` ensures that the number of cubes `m` is not greater than the number of moves `n`. This is necessary because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves if we start from 0 cubes.
- **Condition 2**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, which is required for the feasibility of reaching exactly `m` cubes with `n` moves.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input**: `3 3`
   - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True
   - **Output**: "YES" (Correct)
   
2. **Input**: `2 4`
   - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n >= m` is False
   - **Output**: "NO" (Correct)
   
3. **Input**: `5 3`
   - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is True
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True
   - **Output**: "YES" (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the given conditions and constraints.
