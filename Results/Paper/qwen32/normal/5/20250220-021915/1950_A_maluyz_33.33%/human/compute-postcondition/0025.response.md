The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as specified in the precondition.**
