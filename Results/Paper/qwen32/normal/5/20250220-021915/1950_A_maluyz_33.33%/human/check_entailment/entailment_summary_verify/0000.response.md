Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is correct or incorrect.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Determine whether three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a "stair", "peak", or neither.
- A "stair" satisfies \(a < b < c\).
- A "peak" satisfies \(a < b > c\).
- Otherwise, it is "NONE".

### Provided Program Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Function Summary Recap:
- Reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`.
- Prints 'PEAK' if `max(a, b, c) == b`.
- Prints 'NONE' otherwise.

### Original Assessment Recap:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Explanation:** The condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and incorrect. The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is incorrect because it does not properly distinguish between "PEAK" and "NONE" cases. The suggested fix is to use `elif a < b > c:` instead.

### Analysis:
1. **Stair Condition (`a < b < c`):**
   - The provided code correctly handles the "stair" condition.

2. **Peak Condition (`a < b > c`):**
   - The provided code uses `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` which is incorrect for the "peak" condition.
   - For example, if `a = 2`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, the maximum is `c`, not `b`, and the program incorrectly prints "PEAK".
   - For a "peak", the condition should be `elif a < b > c:`.

3. **None Condition:**
   - The provided code uses `elif a == b == c:` which is unnecessary because if `a == b == c`, it will not satisfy either `a < b < c` or `a < b > c`, so it will correctly print "NONE" in the `else` clause.
   - The `elif a == b == c:` condition is redundant and can be removed.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code has issues with the peak condition and an unnecessary check for all digits being the same. The corrected version of the code fixes these issues.

**Final:** **False**
