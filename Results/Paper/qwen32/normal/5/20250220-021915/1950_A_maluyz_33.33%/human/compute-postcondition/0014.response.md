Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `c`, then `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, and the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b` if `b` is not the largest.**
