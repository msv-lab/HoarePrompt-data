Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided as input.
- It is specified that `a < b < c` is not true.
- It is also specified that `a == b == c` is not true.
- The maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.

The `print('NONE')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The string 'NONE' is directly printed.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NONE**
