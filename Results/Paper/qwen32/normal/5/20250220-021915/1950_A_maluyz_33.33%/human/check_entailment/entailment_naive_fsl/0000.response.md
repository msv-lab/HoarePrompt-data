Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program incorrectly handles cases where two of the digits are the same but not all three. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem does not specify any special handling for when all digits are the same. The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is also incorrect because it does not properly distinguish between "PEAK" and "NONE" cases. For example, consider the input `2 2 3`:

- The program will output "PEAK" because `max(2, 2, 3) == 3` is false, and `b == 2` is true.
- However, this input should output "NONE" because it does not satisfy either the "STAIR" or "PEAK" conditions.

To fix the program, the condition for "PEAK" should be `elif a < b > c:` and the unnecessary condition `elif a == b == c:` should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version correctly handles all cases as per the problem description.
