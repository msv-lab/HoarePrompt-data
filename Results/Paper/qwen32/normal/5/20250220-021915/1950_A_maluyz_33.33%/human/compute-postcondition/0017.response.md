The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies the conditions on the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but only `t` and `i` have specific values or conditions. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten by the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. The conditions on `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant since their values have been updated by the input.**
