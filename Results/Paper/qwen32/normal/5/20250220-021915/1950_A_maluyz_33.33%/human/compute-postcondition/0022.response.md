Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. The conditions on `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant since their values have been updated by the input. If the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as specified in the precondition.**
