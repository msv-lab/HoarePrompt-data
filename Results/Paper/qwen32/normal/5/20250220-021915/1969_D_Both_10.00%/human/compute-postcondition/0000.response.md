The code snippet provided initializes a variable `sub_summ` to 0. This does not affect the existing lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `sub_summ`.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sub_summ` is 0.**
