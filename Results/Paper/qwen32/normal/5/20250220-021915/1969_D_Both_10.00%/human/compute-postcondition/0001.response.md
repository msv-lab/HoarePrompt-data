The only variable in the loop head is `val_a`, which is an element of the list `sec_arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one tuple. The state of `main_ar`, `sub_summ`, and the contents of `sec_arr` (other than the fact that it must have at least one tuple) do not affect whether the loop can execute.

State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sec_arr` must have at least one tuple; `sub_summ` is 0; `val_a` is the first tuple in `sec_arr`**
