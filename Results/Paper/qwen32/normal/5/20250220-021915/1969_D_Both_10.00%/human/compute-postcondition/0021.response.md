Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, which are lists of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers representing the prices for Alice and Bob for a particular item. The function calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and adds to it the sum of `(a_i + b_i)` for each tuple `(a_i, b_i)` in `main_ar` where `(a_i + b_i) >= 0`. The function returns this calculated sum.**
