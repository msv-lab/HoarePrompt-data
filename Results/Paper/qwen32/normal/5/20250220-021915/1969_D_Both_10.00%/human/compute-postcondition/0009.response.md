Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. The current tuple `val_b` from `sec_arr` satisfies the condition that the sum of its two integers is greater than or equal to 0.**
