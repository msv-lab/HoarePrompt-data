Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sec_arr` must have at least one tuple; `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]`; `val_a` is the first tuple in `sec_arr`.**

Natural Language: The value of `sub_summ` has been updated to be the first element of the first tuple in `sec_arr`. All other variables retain their initial states.
