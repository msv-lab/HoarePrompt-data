To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has run `t` times and then `t` is decremented to 0.
2. `index` is the final position after all increments.
3. `arr` is the last list of integers processed.
4. `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration.
5. `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` from the last iteration.
6. `result` is the value returned by `func_1` for the last `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
- The `results` list contains `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(arr)` from each iteration of the loop.
- Since `t` is 0, it means the loop did not execute even once. Therefore, `results` is an empty list.
- The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the `results` list into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\n`).
- If `results` is an empty list, joining it with any separator will result in an empty string.

### Conclusion:
Given that `results` is an empty list, the `print` statement will output an empty string.

Output: **(an empty string)**
