### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program. The program's logic in `func_1` is insufficient to determine if an array can be rotated to become sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted using `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`. If true, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is any element greater than the next element using `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`. If true, it returns 'No'. This part is problematic because it doesn't account for the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and uses `func_1` to determine if each array can be sorted by the allowed operation. Since `func_1` is flawed, `func_2` will produce incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order. This can be done by checking if there is a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part is less than or equal to the first part and both parts are individually sorted.

A correct approach involves:
- Finding the point where the array is not in non-decreasing order.
- Checking if the array can be rotated around this point to become sorted.

### Example:

Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The array is not sorted, and `3 > 1`.
- By rotating the array to `[1, 2, 3]`, we can achieve a sorted order.
- The current implementation would return 'No', which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`. The program does not correctly determine if the array can be rotated to become sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
