The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n` after converting it to an integer. Given that `index` is 1, `n` will be assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
