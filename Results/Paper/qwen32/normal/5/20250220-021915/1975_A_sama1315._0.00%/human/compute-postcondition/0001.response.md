The code snippet reads a line of input using `input().split()`, which will split the input string by whitespace into a list of substrings. Given that `input` has been reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, this line of code will read the entire input as a single string and then split it into a list of substrings based on whitespace.

Since the initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, the `data` variable will be a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the input.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each string is a positive integer from the input.**
