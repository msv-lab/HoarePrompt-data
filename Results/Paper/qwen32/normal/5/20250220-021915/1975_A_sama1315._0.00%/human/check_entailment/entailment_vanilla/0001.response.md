Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where each operation consists of splitting the array into two parts and swapping these two parts.

### Key Insight

The operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them can be seen as rotating the array. Specifically, any rotation of the array can be achieved by a series of such operations. Therefore, the question reduces to whether the array can be rotated to become sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order. One way to do this is to check if there is a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part is less than or equal to the first part and both parts are individually sorted.

### Given Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If such an element exists, it returns 'No'. If not, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and calls `func_1(arr)` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.
   - It stores the results and prints them at the end.

### Issues in the Program

The main issue with the program is in the logic of `func_1(arr)`. The function only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is any element that is greater than the next element. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array can be rotated to become sorted.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`. This array is not sorted, and there is an element that is greater than the next element (`3 > 1`). However, by rotating the array, we can get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted. The current implementation would incorrectly return 'No' for this array.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
