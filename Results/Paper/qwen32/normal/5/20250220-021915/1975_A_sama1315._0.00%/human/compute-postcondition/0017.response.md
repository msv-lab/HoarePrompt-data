The code snippet provided increments the `index` by the value of `n`. Therefore, the new value of `index` will be its previous value plus `n`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state and the operation, the output state will be:
Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` before the increment; `index` is incremented by `n`; `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` remains the integer value of `data[index - 1]` before the increment; `index` is now its previous value plus `n`; `arr` is still a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]` based on the previous `index` value.
