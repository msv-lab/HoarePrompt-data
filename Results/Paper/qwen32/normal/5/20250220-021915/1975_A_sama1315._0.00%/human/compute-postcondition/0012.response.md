Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `results` list now contains the value of `result`, which was previously the value returned by the function `func_1(arr)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
