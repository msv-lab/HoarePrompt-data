Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` before the increment; `index` is incremented by `n`; `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

Natural language explanation: The variable `result` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the list `arr` as its argument. The values of `t`, `n`, `index`, and `arr` remain as they were before the function call, except `index` has already been incremented by `n` as part of the initial state description.
