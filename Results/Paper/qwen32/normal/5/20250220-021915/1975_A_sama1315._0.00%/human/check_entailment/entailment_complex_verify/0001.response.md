### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the provided program. The program only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is any element that is greater than the next element. This approach does not consider the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if there exists a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part results in a sorted array. Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **Identify the Split Point:**
   - The array can be split at points where the array transitions from a larger number to a smaller number. This is a potential point where the array can be rotated to become sorted.

2. **Check Sorted Order Across the Split:**
   - After identifying a potential split point, check if the array from that point to the end and from the start to that point, when concatenated, results in a sorted array.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle arrays that are already sorted.
   - Handle arrays where a single rotation can make them sorted.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

- Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`.
  - The array is not sorted, and there is a point where `3 > 1`.
  - By rotating the array at the point where `3 > 1`, we get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.
  - The current implementation would incorrectly return 'No'.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly implement the solution, we need to find a point in the array where the array can be split and rotated to become sorted. Here's a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    count = 0
    index = -1
    
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:
            count += 1
            index = i
    
    if count == 0:
        return 'Yes'
    elif count == 1:
        return 'Yes' if arr[index] <= arr[(index + 2) % n] else 'No'
    else:
        return 'No'
```

### Evaluation:

The original program does not correctly handle the rotation aspect of the problem. Therefore, based on the analysis and the corrected approach, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:

Final: **False**
