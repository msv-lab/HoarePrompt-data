The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop. However, the loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` before the increment.
- `index` is incremented by `n`.
- `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.
- `results` has `result` appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `t` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, but since we are moving to the next iteration, `t` should simply be the value it currently has (which is the value after decrementing by 1 in the previous iteration).

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` before the increment, `index` is incremented by `n`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `results` has `result` appended to it**.

Since we are only concerned with the loop head variable `_` and the continuation condition `t`, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1**.
