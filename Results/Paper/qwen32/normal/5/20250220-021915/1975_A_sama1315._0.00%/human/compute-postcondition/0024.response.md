The code increments the variable `index` by the value of `n`. Therefore, the new value of `index` will be its previous value plus `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `index` is increased by `n`; `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.**
