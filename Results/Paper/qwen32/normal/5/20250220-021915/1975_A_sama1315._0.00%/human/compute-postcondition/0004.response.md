Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each string is a positive integer from the input; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In simple terms, the list `arr` and the list `data`, as well as the variable `t`, remain unchanged. The variable `index` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1.
