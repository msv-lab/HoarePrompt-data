To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the line `result = func_1(arr)` on the existing variables. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can state that `result` will hold whatever value is returned by `func_1(arr)`.

The other variables (`arr`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, `n`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the function `func_1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` holds the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.**
