### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the given program to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where each operation consists of splitting the array into two parts and swapping these two parts. This operation is equivalent to rotating the array.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order. This means finding a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If such an element exists, it returns 'No'. If not, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and calls `func_1(arr)` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.
   - It stores the results and prints them at the end.

#### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with `func_1(arr)` is that it does not correctly handle the case where the array can be rotated to become sorted. The function only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is any element that is greater than the next element. However, it does not check if there is a valid rotation that can sort the array.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`. This array is not sorted, and there is an element that is greater than the next element (`3 > 1`). However, by rotating the array, we can get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted. The current implementation would incorrectly return 'No' for this array.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation, we need to check if there is a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted. This can be done by finding the number of "inversions" or "drops" in the array. If there is more than one drop, the array cannot be sorted by a single rotation.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the original assessment using the provided function summary and the example test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`
  - The array has multiple drops, and no single rotation can sort it. The function should return 'No'.
  - The current implementation correctly returns 'No'.

- **Test Case 2**: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
  - The array can be rotated to `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted. The function should return 'Yes'.
  - The current implementation incorrectly returns 'No'.

- **Test Case 3**: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - The array is already sorted. The function should return 'Yes'.
  - The current implementation correctly returns 'Yes'.

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
