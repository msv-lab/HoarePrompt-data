### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where the operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
    - The function first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
    - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
    - If the array is not sorted, it checks for any descending order elements using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
    - If there are descending order elements, it returns 'No'.
    - If there are no descending order elements (which is logically impossible if the array is not sorted), it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
    - It collects the results and prints them.

#### Issues:
- The logic in `func_1(arr)` is indeed flawed. The condition `return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'` is incorrect. Just because there are descending order elements doesn't mean the array cannot be sorted using the described operation.
- The correct approach would be to check if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped. Specifically, we need to find a point where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is non-decreasing and can be placed before the prefix to form a non-decreasing array.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The array is not sorted.
- However, it can be split into `[3]` and `[1, 2]`, and swapped to `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

The provided program would incorrectly return 'No' for this array.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find a point `i` such that:
- The array from the start to `i` is non-decreasing.
- The array from `i+1` to the end is non-decreasing.
- The last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.

This can be checked by iterating through the array and finding such a point.

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
