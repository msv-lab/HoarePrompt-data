Reasoning: 
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are supposed to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation of swapping a prefix and suffix any number of times. However, `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through the allowed operation.

The problem description allows for the array to be split into a prefix and suffix, which can be swapped to achieve a sorted array. However, `func_1` does not attempt to simulate or check for this operation. It simply checks if the array is non-decreasing, which is not sufficient based on the problem statement. 

For example, in the second test case of the provided example, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` is not initially sorted, but it can be sorted by performing the allowed operation. `func_1` would incorrectly return 'No' for this case because it does not consider the possibility of sorting through the operation.

Therefore, `func_1` does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
