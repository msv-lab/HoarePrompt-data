Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
Given a binary string `s`, we need to determine the minimum cost to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s) using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.

### Program Analysis
The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the cost to sort the string `s`. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to `0`. This variable will accumulate the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to `0`. This variable counts the number of `1`s encountered so far.

2. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The program iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is `'1'`, it increments the `one` counter.
   - If `i` is `'0'` and `one` is greater than `0`, it adds `one + 1` to `cost`.

### Correctness Analysis
Let's consider the logic behind the cost calculation:
- The cost `one + 1` is added whenever a `0` is encountered after some `1`s have been seen. This cost represents the cost of shifting the `1`s that have been encountered so far past the current `0`.
- The `+1` in `one + 1` accounts for the cost of including the current `0` in the cyclic shift.

Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem:

1. **Example 1: `s = "10"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the first character.
   - At the second character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Correct output: `2`.

2. **Example 2: `s = "0000"`**
   - `one` remains `0` throughout.
   - No `cost` is added.
   - Correct output: `0`.

3. **Example 3: `s = "11000"`**
   - `one` becomes `2` after the first two characters.
   - At the third character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - At the fifth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `6 + 2 + 1 = 9`.
   - Correct output: `9`.

4. **Example 4: `s = "101011"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the first character.
   - At the second character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `one` becomes `2` after the third character.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - Correct output: `5`.

5. **Example 5: `s = "01101001"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the second character.
   - At the third character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'1'`, so `one` becomes `2`.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - `one` becomes `3` after the fifth character.
   - At the sixth character, `one` is `3` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`.
   - At the seventh character, `one` is `3` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `9 + 3 + 1 = 13`.
   - `one` becomes `4` after the eighth character.
   - Incorrect output: `11` (The program seems to miss the correct cost calculation).

The program seems to work correctly for most examples but fails in the last example. The logic of the program seems flawed as it does not account for all necessary shifts correctly.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
