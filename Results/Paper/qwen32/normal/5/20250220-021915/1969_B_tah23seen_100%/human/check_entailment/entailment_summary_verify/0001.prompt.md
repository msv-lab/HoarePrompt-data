You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the sum of `one + 1` for every sequence of consecutive '1's that is immediately followed by a '0'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
Given a binary string `s`, we need to determine the minimum cost to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s) using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.

### Program Analysis
The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the cost to sort the string `s`. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to `0`. This variable will accumulate the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to `0`. This variable counts the number of `1`s encountered so far.

2. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The program iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is `'1'`, it increments the `one` counter.
   - If `i` is `'0'` and `one` is greater than `0`, it adds `one + 1` to `cost`.

### Correctness Analysis
Let's consider the logic behind the cost calculation:
- The cost `one + 1` is added whenever a `0` is encountered after some `1`s have been seen. This cost represents the cost of shifting the `1`s that have been encountered so far past the current `0`.
- The `+1` in `one + 1` accounts for the cost of including the current `0` in the cyclic shift.

Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem:

1. **Example 1: `s = "10"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the first character.
   - At the second character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Correct output: `2`.

2. **Example 2: `s = "0000"`**
   - `one` remains `0` throughout.
   - No `cost` is added.
   - Correct output: `0`.

3. **Example 3: `s = "11000"`**
   - `one` becomes `2` after the first two characters.
   - At the third character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - At the fifth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `6 + 2 + 1 = 9`.
   - Correct output: `9`.

4. **Example 4: `s = "101011"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the first character.
   - At the second character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `one` becomes `2` after the third character.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - Correct output: `5`.

5. **Example 5: `s = "01101001"`**
   - `one` becomes `1` after the second character.
   - At the third character, `one` is `1` and `i` is `'1'`, so `one` becomes `2`.
   - At the fourth character, `one` is `2` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - `one` becomes `3` after the fifth character.
   - At the sixth character, `one` is `3` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `5 + 3 + 1 = 9`.
   - At the seventh character, `one` is `3` and `i` is `'0'`, so `cost` becomes `9 + 3 + 1 = 13`.
   - `one` becomes `4` after the eighth character.
   - Incorrect output: `11` (The program seems to miss the correct cost calculation).

The program seems to work correctly for most examples but fails in the last example. The logic of the program seems flawed as it does not account for all necessary shifts correctly.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
