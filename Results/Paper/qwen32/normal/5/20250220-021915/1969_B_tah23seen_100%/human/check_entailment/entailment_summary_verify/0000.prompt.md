You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the sum of `one + 1` for every sequence of consecutive '1's that is immediately followed by a '0'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
- **Operation**: Choose any substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` and cyclically shift it. The cost of this operation is `r - l + 1`.
- **Goal**: Find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Provided Solution:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0, which counts the number of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iterating through the string**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's encountered (`one > 0`), the cost is increased by `one + 1`. This is because each '0' after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to bring the '1's to the left of the '0's.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation seems to follow the logic of moving all '1's encountered before a '0' to the left of the '0'. The cost is the number of '1's plus the '0' itself (`one + 1`).

### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Calculation: `one = 1`, encounter '0', cost = `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - **Correct**

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `0000`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Calculation: No '1's encountered, cost remains `0`.
   - **Correct**

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `11000`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - Calculation: `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `2 + 1 = 3`. `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `3 + 3 = 6`. `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `6 + 3 = 9`.
   - **Correct**

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `101011`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Calculation: `one = 1`, encounter '0', cost = `1 + 1 = 2`. `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `2 + 3 = 5`. `one = 2`, encounter '1', `one = 3`. `one = 3`, encounter '1', `one = 4`.
   - **Correct**

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `01101001`
   - Expected Output: `11`
   - Calculation: `one = 1`, encounter '0', cost = `1 + 1 = 2`. `one = 2`, encounter '0', cost = `2 + 3 = 5`. `one = 3`, encounter '0', cost = `5 + 4 = 9`. `one = 3`, encounter '1', `one = 4`. `one = 4`, encounter '0', cost = `9 + 5 = 14`. `one = 4`, encounter '1', `one = 5`. `one = 5`.
   - **Incorrect** (The expected output is `11`, but the calculation gives `14`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all cases. Specifically, the cost calculation seems to overestimate the cost in certain scenarios.

**Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation of the Error:
The cost calculation logic (`cost += one + 1`) does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string. The cost should be calculated based on the optimal cyclic shifts required to bring all '1's to the left of all '0's, which the current logic does not achieve correctly for all test cases.
