The code snippet `cost += one + 1` increments the variable `cost` by the sum of `one` and 1. The values of `s`, `one`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code.

Given that `cost` was initially 0, after the operation, `cost` will be `one + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2, `cost` is `one + 1`, `one` is greater than 0, and the current character `i` is '0'.**
