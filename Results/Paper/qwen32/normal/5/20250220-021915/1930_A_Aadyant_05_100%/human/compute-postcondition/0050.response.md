The code snippet initializes an empty list named `list2`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the variables `s`, `n`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, `str`, `final`, and `num` remain unchanged except for the creation of `list2`.

Output State: **`s` is 0; `n`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, and `str` remain unchanged; `final` includes the value of `s` (before it was reset) appended to it; `num` is the previous value of `num` plus 1; `list2` is an empty list.**
