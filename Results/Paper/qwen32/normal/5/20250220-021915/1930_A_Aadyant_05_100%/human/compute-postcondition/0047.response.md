The code appends the value of `s` to the list `final`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is updated to the sum of integers at all even indices of `list2`. The values of `n`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, and `str` remain unchanged. `final` now includes the value of `s` appended to it.
