The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `final`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input string representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard, and `t` is the total number of test cases, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard; `t` is between 1 and 5000; `final` is an empty list.**
