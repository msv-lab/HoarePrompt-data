Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly implements the solution.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Field Representation**: The field is a grid with `N` rows and `M` columns. Each cell can contain one or more entities such as players, goals, the Quaffle, or the Bludger.
2. **Entities**: 
   - Players (R0, R1, ..., R9, B0, B1, ..., B9)
   - Goals (RG, BG)
   - Quaffle (.Q)
   - Bludger (.B)
3. **Actions**:
   - Players can move (U, D, L, R).
   - Players can catch the Quaffle (C).
   - Players can throw the Quaffle (T).
4. **Game Rules**:
   - If a player throws the Quaffle into a goal of the opposing team, that team scores a point.
   - If a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the opposing team scores a point.
   - If a player is in the same cell as the Bludger, they are eliminated.
5. **Output**:
   - Print the time and event (GOAL or ELIMINATED) for each significant event.
   - Print the final score at the end.

### Code Analysis

The provided code includes two functions:
1. **`func_1(obj, d)`**:
   - This function updates the position of an object (`obj`) based on the direction (`d`).
   - It correctly handles the movement of an object in the grid (U, D, L, R).
2. **`func_2(t)`**:
   - This function checks if any player is in the same cell as the Bludger.
   - If so, it prints the time (`t`), player identifier, and "ELIMINATED".
   - It updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to mark them as eliminated.

### Missing Components

The provided code does not cover several critical aspects of the problem:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Parsing the input to initialize the field, player positions, Quaffle position, and Bludger position.
2. **Action Handling**:
   - Parsing and handling the actions for each player.
   - Checking if a player catches the Quaffle.
   - Checking if a player throws the Quaffle and updating the score accordingly.
3. **Output**:
   - Printing the GOAL events.
   - Printing the final score.

### Conclusion

The provided code snippets (`func_1` and `func_2`) are correct for their specific purposes but do not cover the entire problem. They do not handle the initialization, action parsing, scoring, and final output, which are essential for solving the problem.

**Correctness: False**

The code is incomplete and does not solve the entire problem as described.
