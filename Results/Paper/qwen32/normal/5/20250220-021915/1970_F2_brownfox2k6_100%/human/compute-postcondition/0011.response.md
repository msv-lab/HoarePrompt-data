Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field, `p` is the next player identifier in the `player` dictionary after the previous `p`, `out` is a list that now includes the player identifier `p`.**

In simpler terms, the player identifier `p` has been added to the `out` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
