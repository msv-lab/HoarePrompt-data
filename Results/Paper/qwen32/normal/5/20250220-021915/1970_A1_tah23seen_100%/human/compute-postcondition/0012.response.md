The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the value of `d[i + 1]` based on the value of `d[i]`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `d[i + 1]` is now set to one less than the previous value `d[i]`.

The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions. `s` is still a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence. `n` is still the length of `s`. `i` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`**.
