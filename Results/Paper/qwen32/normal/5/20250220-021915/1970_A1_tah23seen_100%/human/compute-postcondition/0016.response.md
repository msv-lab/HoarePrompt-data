The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the value of `d` at index `i + 1` to be one less than the value of `d` at index `i`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `i` is now `i + 1` before this line is executed. Therefore, `d[i + 1]` is being set to `d[i] - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`.**
