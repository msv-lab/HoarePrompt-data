The code snippet `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Given the initial state, `d[n]` is `0`. After executing this line, the key `n` and its associated value `0` will be removed from the dictionary `d`.

Output State: **`d` will be a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n-1` where `d[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n-1` will be the cumulative count of opening parentheses minus closing parentheses up to that point.**
