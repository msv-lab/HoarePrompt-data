The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- The value of `i` depends on the previous iteration, and `d[i + 1]` is calculated based on whether `s[i]` is "(" or ")".

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, provided that `i + 1` is less than `n`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `i + 1`**
