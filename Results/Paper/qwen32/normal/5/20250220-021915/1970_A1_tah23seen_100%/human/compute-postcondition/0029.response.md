Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns the concatenation of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.**
