To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `j` in this case. The loop iterates over the list of tuples `d`, so the key to ensuring the loop executes is to make sure `d` is not empty.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `j`, which are the elements of the tuples in the list `d`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `d` contains at least one tuple. If `d` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: To ensure the loop executes, `d` must contain at least one tuple. The specific values of `i` and `j` do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as they will be assigned the values of the first tuple in `d` during the first iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `d` is not empty.

State: **`d` is a list of tuples sorted by the cumulative count of opening parentheses minus closing parentheses (in ascending order), and by the keys (in descending order) in case of ties, and `d` must contain at least one tuple**.
