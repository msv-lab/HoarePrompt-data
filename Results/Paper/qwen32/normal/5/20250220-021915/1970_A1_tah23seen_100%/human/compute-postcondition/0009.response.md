Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`. If `s[i]` is "(", then `i` is initialized to a value such that `s[i]` is "(", and `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 1`. If `s[i]` is ")", then `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`.**
