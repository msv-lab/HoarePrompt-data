The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments the value of `res` by the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This means `res` will now hold its previous value plus the newly calculated combination value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, and `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.**
