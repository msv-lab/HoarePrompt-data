The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` adds the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time to the variable `res`. 

Given the initial state, `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is at least 3, otherwise, it remains unchanged. The values of `nums`, `num_of_lens`, `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the new `cnt`.**
