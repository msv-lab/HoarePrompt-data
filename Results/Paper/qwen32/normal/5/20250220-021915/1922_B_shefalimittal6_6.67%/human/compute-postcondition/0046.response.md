Output State: **`res` is 0, `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `res` has been explicitly set to 0 by the code. The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `nums` remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.
