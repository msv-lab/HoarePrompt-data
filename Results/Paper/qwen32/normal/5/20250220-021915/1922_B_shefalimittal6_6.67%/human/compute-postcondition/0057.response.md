Postcondition: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` again if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, and `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged from its initial value plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if applicable.**
