Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its original value. All other variables remain in their initial states or as previously described.
