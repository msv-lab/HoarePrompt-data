The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments the value of `res` by the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. 

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `total_sum`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Given the initial state, `res` was already being incremented based on the conditions involving `cnt`. This line adds an additional increment to `res` specifically by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

Output State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value.**
