Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary that contains each unique integer from the list `nums` as keys, and the number of times each integer appears in `nums` as their corresponding values. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
