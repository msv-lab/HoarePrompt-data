The code snippet provided updates the value of `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. The values of `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` was greater than or equal to 3 and plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.**
