The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This action does not affect the values of `res`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of `res`, `t`, and `n` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`res` is the cumulative sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt >= 3` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt >= 2` where `total_sum` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**
