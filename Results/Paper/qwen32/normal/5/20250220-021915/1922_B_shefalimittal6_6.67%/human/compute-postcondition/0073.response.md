The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the list `nums`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `nums` to ensure it contains at least one element. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `n`, and `num_of_lens`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element**
