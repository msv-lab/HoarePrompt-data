Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is the current element being processed.**

Natural Language: The list `nums` remains unchanged. The dictionary `num_of_lens` has its entry for the key `x` incremented by 1. If `x` was not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with the value 1.
