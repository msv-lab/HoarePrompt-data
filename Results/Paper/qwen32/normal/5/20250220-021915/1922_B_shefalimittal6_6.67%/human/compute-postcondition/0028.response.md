The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` adds the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time to the variable `res`. Given that `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()`, the specific value of `res` will depend on the initial value of `res` and the value of `cnt`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**.
