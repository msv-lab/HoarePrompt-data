The code snippet provided updates the variable `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless updated by this operation. Since `res` is the only variable being modified, we focus on its new value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is `cnt_next`, `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding those equal to `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `res` is now `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
