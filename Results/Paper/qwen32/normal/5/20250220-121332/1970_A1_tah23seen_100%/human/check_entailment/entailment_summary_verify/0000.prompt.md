You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` which is a rearrangement of characters from `s` based on the net number of opening parentheses up to each index, sorted by the net number and then by the index in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has an issue in the way it constructs the balanced shuffle. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the sorting and construction of the shuffled sequence. The sorting logic is correct in that it sorts by prefix balance and then by position in decreasing order, but the way the characters are appended to the result string `ans` is flawed. The code uses the position `i` from the sorted dictionary directly, which does not correspond to the correct character in the original string `s`.

To illustrate, let's consider the example given in the problem description:

Input:
```
(()(()))
```

Expected Output:
```
()(()())
```

Let's trace the execution of the code with this input:

1. The prefix balances are calculated as follows:
   - Prefix balance: 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1
   - Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
   - Characters: (, (, ), (, (, ), ), )

2. After sorting by prefix balance and then by position in decreasing order, we get:
   - Prefix balance: 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3
   - Positions: 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 6
   - Characters: (, ), (, (, ), (, ), )

3. The code then constructs the result string by appending the characters at the sorted positions:
   - The positions are 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 6
   - The characters at these positions in the original string are: (, ), (, (, ), (, ), )

However, the code uses the positions directly to index into the original string `s`, which is incorrect. The positions in the sorted list do not correspond to the correct characters in the original string when used as indices.

To fix this, the code should use the characters directly from the sorted list of tuples, not the positions. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (pos, balance) in d:
        ans += s[pos - 1]  # Use pos - 1 to get the correct character from the original string
    return ans
```

With this correction, the code should work correctly for the given example and other test cases. However, the original code provided does not have this correction, so it is incorrect.
