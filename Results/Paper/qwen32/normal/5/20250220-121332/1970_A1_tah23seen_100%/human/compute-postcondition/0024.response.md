The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `d`, `(i, j)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]` followed by `s[i]`; `d` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and the tuples are sorted by the net number of opening parentheses in ascending order, and by index in descending order if the net number of opening parentheses is the same; `(i, j)` is the next tuple in the list `d`.**
