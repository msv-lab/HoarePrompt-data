Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]` followed by `s[i]` and then `s[i]`; `d` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and the tuples are sorted by the net number of opening parentheses in ascending order, and by index in descending order if the net number of opening parentheses is the same; `(i, j)` has been processed, and `(i_next, j_next)` is the next tuple in the list `d`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to include an additional `s[i]` at the end, making it the character `s[i]` repeated three times. All other variables remain unchanged.
