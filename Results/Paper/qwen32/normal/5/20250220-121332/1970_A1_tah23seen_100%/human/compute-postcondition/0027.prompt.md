Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the net number of opening parentheses in ascending order, and by index in descending order if the net number of opening parentheses is the same.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]`; `d` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and the tuples are sorted by the net number of opening parentheses in ascending order, and by index in descending order if the net number of opening parentheses is the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]` followed by `s[i]`; `d` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and the tuples are sorted by the net number of opening parentheses in ascending order, and by index in descending order if the net number of opening parentheses is the same; `(i, j)` is the next tuple in the list `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]` followed by `s[i]` and then `s[i]`; `d` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and the tuples are sorted by the net number of opening parentheses in ascending order, and by index in descending order if the net number of opening parentheses is the same; `(i, j)` has been processed, and `(i_next, j_next)` is the next tuple in the list `d`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
