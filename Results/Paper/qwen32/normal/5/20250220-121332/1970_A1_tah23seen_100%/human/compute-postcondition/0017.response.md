Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. `i` is 2, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary. If the first character of `s` is "(", then if `s[i]` is "(", `d` has keys `0`, `1`, and `2` with values `0`, `2`, and `3` respectively; otherwise, `d` has keys `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` with values `0`, `1`, `0`, and `1` respectively. If the first character of `s` is ")", then if `s[i]` is "(", `d` has keys `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` with values `0`, `0`, `-2`, and `-1` respectively; otherwise, `d` has keys `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` with values `0`, `-1`, `-1`, and `0` respectively. If `s[i]` is not "(", then `d` is `{0: 0, 1: -1, 3: -2}`.**
