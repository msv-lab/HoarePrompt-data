Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**

Natural language: The values of `start` and `end` remain non-negative integers with `start` still being less than or equal to `end`. The value of `t` remains greater than 0. A new variable `n` is introduced and is assigned the value of an input integer.
