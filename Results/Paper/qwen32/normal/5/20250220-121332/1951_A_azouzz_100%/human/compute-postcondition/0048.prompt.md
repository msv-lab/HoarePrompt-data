Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2:
        print('NO')
    elif cnt1 == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either 0, 2, or an odd number. If `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 2 or an odd number greater than 2. If `s` does not contain the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 0 or 2 or an odd number greater than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either 0, 1, 2, or an odd number. If the new `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 2 or an odd number greater than 2. If the new `s` does not contain the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 0, 1, 2, or an odd number greater than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t + 1`; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged regardless of the number of '1's in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
