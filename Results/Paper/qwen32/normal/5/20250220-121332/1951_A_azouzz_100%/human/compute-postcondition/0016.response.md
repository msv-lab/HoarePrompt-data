Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. `cnt1` is either 0, 2, or an odd number greater than 2, but not equal to 1; and the substring '11' is not in `s`.**
