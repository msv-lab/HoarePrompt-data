Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`. `t` is `t - 1`. `n` is an input integer. `s` is the new value of the user input. `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 2 or an odd number greater than 2. If `s` does not contain the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 0, 2, or an odd number greater than 2.**
