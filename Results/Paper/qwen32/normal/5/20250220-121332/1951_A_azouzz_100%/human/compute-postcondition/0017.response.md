The provided Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is solely determined by the `print` statement itself.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
