The code snippet `s = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `s`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input.**
