Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`. `t` is `t - 1`. `n` is an input integer. `s` is the new value of the user input. `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `cnt1` is 1, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, if `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 2 or an odd number greater than 2. If `s` does not contain the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 0, 2, or an odd number greater than 2.**

This means that after the if-else block, `start` and `end` remain non-negative integers with `start` less than or equal to `end`. The variable `t` is decremented by 1. The variable `n` remains the input integer, and `s` retains its new value as the user input. The count of '1's in `s` (`cnt1`) is such that if it is 1, the if part is executed. If `cnt1` is not 1, it is determined by whether `s` contains the substring '11': if it does, `cnt1` is either 2 or an odd number greater than 2; if it does not, `cnt1` is either 0, 2, or an odd number greater than 2.**
