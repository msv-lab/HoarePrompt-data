To determine the Output State, we need to understand the function `func_1()` and its impact on the variables. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context. Without the definition of `func_1()`, we cannot determine how the variables are affected.

Given the current information, we can only state that the function `func_1()` has been called, and since its definition is unknown, we cannot infer any changes to the variable `t` or any other variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the addition that `func_1()` has been executed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `func_1()` has been executed.**
