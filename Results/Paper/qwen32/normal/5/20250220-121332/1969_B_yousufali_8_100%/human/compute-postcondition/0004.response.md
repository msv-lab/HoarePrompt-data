To determine the output state, I need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, I'll assume that `func_1()` does not modify any variables in the given initial state or return any value that affects the output state as described. Therefore, the state of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 1.**
