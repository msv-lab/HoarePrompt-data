To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution provided.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to transform a binary string into a non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on substrings, and to do so with the minimum total cost. The cost of shifting a substring is the length of that substring.

### Key Observations:

1. **Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift of a substring can move a '1' to the left of a '0', which is necessary to sort the string.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Each time a '0' is encountered after a '1', it indicates that a shift has to be performed to move the '1' before the '0'. The cost of this shift is the position of the '0' plus the number of '1's encountered so far.
3. **Minimum Cost**: The provided solution calculates the minimum cost by counting the number of '1's encountered (`n`) and adding `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`) each time a '0' is encountered after a '1'. The `+1` accounts for the fact that the substring length includes the '0' itself.

### Implementation Details:

- **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a binary string, counts the '1's encountered (`n`), and calculates the total cost (`ans`) by adding `n + 1` each time a '0' is encountered after a '1'.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:

Let's verify the correctness of the solution with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**: `s = "10"`
   - `n = 1` (first '1')
   - `ans += 1 + 1` (encountered '0' after '1')
   - `ans = 2` (correct)

2. **Second Test Case**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's, so `ans = 0` (correct)

3. **Third Test Case**: `s = "11000"`
   - `n = 2` (first '1')
   - `n = 3` (second '1')
   - `ans += 3 + 1` (first '0' after '1')
   - `ans += 3 + 1` (second '0' after '1')
   - `ans += 3 + 1` (third '0' after '1')
   - `ans = 12` (incorrect, should be 9)

The third test case indicates an issue with the solution. The correct approach should involve shifting substrings more efficiently, but the provided solution does not account for optimal substring selection.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not always yield the minimum cost for sorting the string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
