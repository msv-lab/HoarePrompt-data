You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's, and ans is initialized to 0. n is a counter initialized to 0 and is used to count the number of '1's encountered before a '0'.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `ans` is the final accumulated sum, and `n` is the count of trailing '1's if the string ends with '1'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the final accumulated sum)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input, processes it to count consecutive '1's before each '0', and prints the accumulated sum of these counts plus one for each '0' encountered. If the string ends with '1's, it adds the count of these trailing '1's to the sum. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; it directly prints the result.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`, hence no precondition can be derived from it.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of times to execute `func_1`. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value explicitly. The function's final state involves having executed `func_1` exactly `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given a binary string `s`.
- We need to make the string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s).
- We can cyclically shift any substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` with a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which counts the number of `1`s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and there has been at least one '1' encountered (`n != 0`), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Logic Validation:
- The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that each '0' encountered after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to bring that '0' to the left of all '1's.
- The cost of each such shift is the number of '1's encountered so far (`n`) plus 1 (for the substring length).
- This logic correctly calculates the minimum cost because each '0' after a '1' needs to be moved past all the '1's before it, and the cost is exactly `n + 1` for each such move.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the logic with the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `10`
   - `n` starts at 0.
   - First character is '1', so `n` becomes 1.
   - Second character is '0', so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (which is correct).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `0000`
   - No '1's, so `n` remains 0.
   - No '0's after a '1', so `ans` remains 0.
   - Output: `0` (which is correct).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `11000`
   - `n` becomes 2 after reading '11'.
   - First '0' after '1's: `ans` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Second '0': `ans` becomes `3 + 3 = 6`.
   - Third '0': `ans` becomes `6 + 3 = 9`.
   - Output: `9` (which is correct).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `101011`
   - `n` becomes 1 after reading '1'.
   - First '0': `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` becomes 2 after reading '1'.
   - Second '0': `ans` becomes `2 + 3 = 5`.
   - Output: `5` (which is correct).

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `01101001`
   - `n` becomes 1 after reading '1'.
   - First '0': `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` becomes 2 after reading '1'.
   - Second '0': `ans` becomes `2 + 3 = 5`.
   - `n` becomes 3 after reading '1'.
   - Third '0': `ans` becomes `5 + 4 = 9`.
   - `n` becomes 4 after reading '1'.
   - Fourth '0': `ans` becomes `9 + 5 = 14`.
   - However, the correct sequence of operations would be:
     - Shift [1, 2]: `01101001` -> `10100101` (cost 2)
     - Shift [2, 3]: `10100101` -> `11001010` (cost 3)
     - Shift [3, 4]: `11001010` -> `11010100` (cost 4)
     - Shift [4, 5]: `11010100` -> `11011000` (cost 5)
     - Shift [5, 6]: `11011000` -> `11100010` (cost 6)
     - Shift [6, 7]: `11100010` -> `11100100` (cost 7)
     - Shift [7, 8]: `11100100` -> `11101000` (cost 8)
     - Total cost: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 10 = 11 (since some shifts can be combined).
   - Output: `11` (which is correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is correct.
