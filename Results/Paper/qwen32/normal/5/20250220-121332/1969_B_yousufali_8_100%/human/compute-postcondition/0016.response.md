The code snippet `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. The values of `s` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input binary string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is `i + 2`, and `n` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`s` is the input binary string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is incremented by 1**.
