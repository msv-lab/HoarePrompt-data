To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, since `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only assume that it performs some operations that might change the state of the program. Without knowing the definition of `func_1()`, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables.

Given the information provided, the only variable we know about is `t`, which is an input integer that must be greater than 0. Since `func_1()` is called but its definition is not provided, we cannot infer any changes to `t` or any other variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0**.
