Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes a binary string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's, counting the number of '1's encountered consecutively before a '0' is found. It returns the maximum count of consecutive '1's encountered before any '0'. If there are no '0's in the string, it returns the total count of '1's in the string.**
