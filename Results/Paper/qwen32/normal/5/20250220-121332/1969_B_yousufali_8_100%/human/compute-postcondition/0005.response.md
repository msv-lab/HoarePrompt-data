The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's state. However, the loop's execution depends on the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations.

Given that `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0**
