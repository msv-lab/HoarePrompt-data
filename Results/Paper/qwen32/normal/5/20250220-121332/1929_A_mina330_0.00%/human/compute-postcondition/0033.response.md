Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `ntest` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the new integer input by the user such that `n` ≥ 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 provided by the user and `n` ≥ 2, `kq` is `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `itest` is the value of `itest` from the previous iteration plus 1, `i` is 0**.

In natural language: The value of `kq` has been updated to be the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `a`. The values of `t`, `ntest`, `n`, `a`, `itest`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
