Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic Error in Splitting Numbers**:
   - The program attempts to split a number if it is greater than 10 and the previous number is greater than the current number. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of needing to split multiple numbers or numbers that are not adjacent to the current number.
   - The program only checks the previous number, but the problem allows splitting any number that is at least 10, regardless of its position.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Multiple Splits**:
   - The program only performs a single split operation per iteration of the outer loop. This is insufficient, as multiple splits might be needed to sort the array.

3. **Incorrect Placement of Split Digits**:
   - The program incorrectly inserts the digits of the split number. For example, if the number 12 is split, it should be replaced by the digits 1 and 2, but the current logic incorrectly places the digits in the wrong positions.

4. **Lack of Proper Loop Control**:
   - The program does not ensure that the entire array is checked and modified until it is sorted or no further splits are possible.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
30 2 10 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- Split 30 into 3 and 0, resulting in [3, 0, 2, 10, 5].
- Split 10 into 1 and 0, resulting in [3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 5].
- The array can then be sorted to [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5].

However, the current program would not handle this case correctly because it does not perform enough splits or handle the splits correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
