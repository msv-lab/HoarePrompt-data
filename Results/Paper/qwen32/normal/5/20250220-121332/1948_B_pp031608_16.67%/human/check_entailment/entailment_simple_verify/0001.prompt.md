You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers representing the elements of the array a, where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst, n, satisfies 2 <= n <= 50. Additionally, the function will be called multiple times (1 <= t <= 10^3) with different such lists.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the list `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Operation**: For any element in the array that is at least 10, it can be split into its individual digits and inserted back into the array in the same position.
2. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to transform the array into a non-decreasing order using the above operation.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the array starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is not sorted and the current element is greater than the previous one and greater than 10, it attempts to split the previous element.
   - The split operation is performed by removing the previous element and inserting its digits back into the array.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After attempting to sort the array, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting**:
   - The program only considers splitting the previous element if it is greater than the current element and greater than 10.
   - This logic is flawed because it only attempts to split once and does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where the current element is less than the previous one.

2. **Inefficient Approach**:
   - The program does not consider all possible splits and their effects on the array.
   - It only checks the immediate neighbors, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted through any number of splits.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted, but it is not used effectively in the main logic.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted through the described operations. It fails to handle all possible scenarios and does not guarantee that the array will be checked in a way that considers all possible splits.

**Correctness: False**
