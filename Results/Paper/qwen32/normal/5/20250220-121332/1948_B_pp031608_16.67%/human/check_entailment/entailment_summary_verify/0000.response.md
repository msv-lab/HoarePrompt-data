Let's evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine if it's possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits.

### Provided Program Analysis
Here is the provided program for reference:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
```

### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_1` checks if a given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.

### Issues Identified in the Program
1. **Logic Error in Splitting Numbers**:
   - The program only checks if the previous number is greater than the current number and greater than 10 to decide whether to split. This is incorrect because the problem allows splitting any number that is at least 10, regardless of its position relative to the current number.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Multiple Splits**:
   - The program only performs a single split operation per iteration of the outer loop. This is insufficient because multiple splits might be needed to sort the array.

3. **Incorrect Placement of Split Digits**:
   - The program incorrectly inserts the digits of the split number. For example, if the number 12 is split, it should be replaced by the digits 1 and 2, but the current logic incorrectly places the digits in the wrong positions.

4. **Lack of Proper Loop Control**:
   - The program does not ensure that the entire array is checked and modified until it is sorted or no further splits are possible.

### Example Case Analysis
Consider the test case:
```
1
4
30 2 10 5
```
- The correct sequence of operations would be:
  1. Split 30 into 3 and 0, resulting in `[3, 0, 2, 10, 5]`.
  2. Split 10 into 1 and 0, resulting in `[3, 0, 2, 1, 0, 5]`.
  3. The array can then be sorted to `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5]`.

The provided program would not handle this case correctly because it does not perform enough splits or handle the splits correctly.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to handle multiple splits, incorrect placement of split digits, and does not ensure that the entire array is checked and modified until it is sorted or no further splits are possible.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect.
