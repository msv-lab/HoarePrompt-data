### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it correctly computes the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by applying the operation at most once.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements in the array equal by selecting a contiguous subarray and replacing all its elements with a single value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. We need to find the minimum cost to achieve this.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1` is supposed to return the minimum cost of making all elements equal. The function's logic is as follows:
1. Initialize `i` to 0 and `j` to `len(arr) - 1`.
2. Increment `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` to find the length of the initial segment of identical elements from the start.
3. Decrement `j` as long as `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]` to find the length of the final segment of identical elements from the end.
4. If the first and last elements are the same (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
5. Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are some specific issues:
- **Case 1:** When the array has a repeating pattern but the first and last elements are different, the function may not return the correct result. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`. The function will not correctly identify the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal.
- **Case 2:** When the array has multiple segments of different elements, the function does not consider the optimal segment to replace. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function will return `4`, but the optimal solution is to replace the middle segment `[2, 3, 4]` with `1`, which would cost `3` burles.

The function `func_1` only considers the segments starting from the beginning and ending at the end of the array, and it does not consider other potential segments that might yield a lower cost. Therefore, the function is not correct for all cases.

#### Example:
Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  6
  1 2 3 1 2 3
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  3
  ```
- **Actual Output from the function:**
  ```
  4
  ```

The function incorrectly calculates the cost as `4` instead of `3`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Final: **False**
