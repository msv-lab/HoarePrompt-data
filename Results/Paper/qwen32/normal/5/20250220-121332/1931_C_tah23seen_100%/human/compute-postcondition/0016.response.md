To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its behavior.

The loop:
```python
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1
```
This loop decrements `j` as long as `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`. Essentially, it finds the first index `j` from the end of the list where the value changes.

Given the initial state and the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop will continue to decrement `j` until it finds an element that is different from the previous one or until `j` becomes 0.
- The final value of `j` will be the index of the first element from the end that is different from the previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same.

Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged (it is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same).
- `n` remains unchanged (it is the length of `arr`).
- `j` will be the index of the first element from the end that is different from the previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same.

In natural language: The list `arr` stays the same, `i` stays the same, `n` stays the same, and `j` will be the index of the first element from the end of the list that is different from the previous element, or 0 if all elements in the list are the same.

Output State: **`arr` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `j` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from the previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same.**
