Given the initial state, we know that `arr` is a list, `i` and `n` are integers, and `j` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from the previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same. Additionally, the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `arr` remains the same, so we can infer that its first and last elements are different.
- `i` remains the same, so it is a specific index in the list.
- `n` remains the same, so it is the length of the list.
- `j` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from the previous element.

The expression `min(n - i - 1, j)` calculates the minimum of two values:
1. `n - i - 1` is the number of elements after index `i` in the list `arr`.
2. `j` is the index of the first element from the end that is different from the previous element.

Since `j` is defined as the index of the first element from the end that is different from the previous element, `j` is a non-negative integer and it is less than `n`.

The `max(..., 0)` ensures that the result is not negative, which is redundant in this context because both `n - i - 1` and `j` are non-negative.

Thus, the program returns the maximum of `n - i - 1` and `j`.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum of `n - i - 1` and `j`.**
