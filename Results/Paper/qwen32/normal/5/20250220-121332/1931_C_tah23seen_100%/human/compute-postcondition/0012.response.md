To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the last two elements are equal.
- `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same.
- `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `j` is `len(arr) - 2`.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **`j > 0`**: This condition ensures that `j` is a valid index and that there is at least one element before `j` to compare with. Since `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 2`, this condition will be true as long as `len(arr) > 1`.

2. **`arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**: This condition ensures that the current element at index `j` is equal to the previous element at index `j - 1`. Given that the last two elements of `arr` are equal, this condition will be true for the initial value of `j`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that both conditions are met. Since the initial state already satisfies `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` (because the last two elements are equal), we only need to ensure that `j > 0` remains true. 

However, if `j` is currently 1 (which is the smallest value that satisfies `j > 0`), then decrementing `j` in the loop will make `j` equal to 0, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `j` should be greater than 1.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. It should be set to a value greater than 1 to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the last two elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `j` must be greater than 1**
