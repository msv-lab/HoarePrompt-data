The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2] == arr[3]`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2] == arr[3]`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`**.
