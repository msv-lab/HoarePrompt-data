Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks the start and end of the array for the first and last differing elements and does not consider the optimal way to use the allowed operation to make all elements equal. The optimal solution involves considering all possible values that the array could be set to and calculating the minimum cost required to make the entire array equal to that value using at most one operation. The current solution does not account for all possible scenarios and will not provide the correct answer for all test cases.
