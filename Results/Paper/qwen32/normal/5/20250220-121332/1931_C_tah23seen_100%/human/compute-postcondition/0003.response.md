To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop header:

```
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are satisfied:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

Let's analyze the conditions with the given state:

1. **Condition `i < len(arr) - 1`**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `len(arr) - 1` is the last valid index in the array.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`.
   - Given `i` is 0, this condition will be satisfied if `len(arr) > 1`.

2. **Condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**:
   - `arr[i]` is the element at index `i`.
   - `arr[i + 1]` is the element at index `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` must be equal.
   - Given `i` is 0, this condition will be satisfied if `arr[0] == arr[1]`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state such that both conditions are met. Specifically:
- `len(arr)` must be greater than 1.
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1]`, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr` and `n > 1`, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`**.

This ensures that the loop can execute at least once.
