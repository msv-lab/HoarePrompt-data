Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.**

To break this down, the program calculates the sum of the integer division (using `//`) of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3. Each value in `freq` represents the count of a unique value from the list `arr` (excluding the first element `t`). The result is the sum of these integer divisions.
