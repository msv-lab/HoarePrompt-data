Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed using given sticks, where:
- Each polygon must have equal sides.
- Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick.
- No stick can be used in more than one polygon.

### Key Points
- To form a regular polygon, the number of sticks used must be at least 3 (the minimum number of sides for a polygon is 3).
- For a given stick length, the maximum number of polygons that can be formed is determined by the integer division of the count of sticks of that length by 3 (since each polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length).

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of a main loop that reads input for each test case and calls a function `func_1` to compute the result for each test case. Here's a breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function creates a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It iterates through the list of stick lengths and updates the count for each length in the dictionary.

2. **Polygon Count Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the sum of integer divisions of the counts by 3.
   - This sum represents the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using the sticks.

### Correctness of the Program

The program is incorrect because it assumes that the only polygons that can be formed are triangles (3-sided polygons). However, the problem statement allows for polygons with any number of sides (at least 3).

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
(We can form two squares, each with side length 2.)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```
(The program correctly outputs 2 for this case, but this is not a sufficient test for correctness.)

However, consider another test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
3 3 3 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
(We can form two equilateral triangles, each with side length 3.)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```
(The program correctly outputs 2 for this case as well, but this is still not sufficient.)

The problem arises when we have more than 3 sticks of the same length and can form polygons with more than 3 sides. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
9
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
(We can form three triangles, each with side length 2.)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
3
```
(The program correctly outputs 3 for this case, but this is still not sufficient.)

However, if we consider a case where we can form polygons with more than 3 sides:

**Input:**
```
1
9
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
(We can form three triangles, each with side length 3, or one hexagon and one triangle, etc.)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
3
```
(The program correctly outputs 3 for this case, but this is still not sufficient.)

The issue is that the program only considers forming triangles and does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
