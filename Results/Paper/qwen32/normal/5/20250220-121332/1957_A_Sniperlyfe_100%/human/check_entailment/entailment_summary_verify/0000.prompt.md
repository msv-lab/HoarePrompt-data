You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers where the first element indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer representing the number of sticks followed by the lengths of those sticks. The function calculates and returns the total number of groups of three sticks that can be formed from all test cases, considering each unique stick length.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed is the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3. This assumption is incorrect because it does not consider polygons with more than 3 sides.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The correct answer should be 1 because we can form a hexagon (6-sided polygon) with all six sticks of length 2. However, the program will output 2 because it calculates `6 // 3` which equals 2.

Another example:
```
1
9
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```
The correct answer is 1 because we can form a nonagon (9-sided polygon) with all nine sticks of length 3. The program will output 3 because it calculates `9 // 3` which equals 3.

The program needs to consider all possible regular polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) that can be formed with the given sticks, not just triangles (which require 3 sticks). Therefore, the current implementation is incorrect.
