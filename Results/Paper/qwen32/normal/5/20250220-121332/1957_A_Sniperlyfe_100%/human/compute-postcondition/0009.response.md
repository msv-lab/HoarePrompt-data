Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. The function returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3 across all test cases.**
