#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks available, and the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique value of `n` from `arr` (excluding the first element `t`).
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers where the first element indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer representing the number of sticks followed by the lengths of those sticks. The function calculates and returns the total number of groups of three sticks that can be formed from all test cases, considering each unique stick length.
