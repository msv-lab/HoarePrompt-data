Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. However, there's a logical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. The function currently calculates the sum of the integer division of each stick length's frequency by 3. This logic does not correctly solve the problem because:

- The problem requires forming polygons with equal-sided sticks, and the minimum number of sides for a polygon is 3 (a triangle).
- The given program assumes that any group of three sticks of the same length can form a polygon, which is incorrect. For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 3, the program would return 2, suggesting two triangles can be formed. However, the problem asks for the maximum number of regular polygons, which in this case would be one square, not two triangles.

The correct approach should involve finding the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by each stick length, considering the minimum number of sides required for a polygon (3). However, the provided code does not account for this correctly.

Given the current implementation of `func_1`, it does not accurately reflect the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
