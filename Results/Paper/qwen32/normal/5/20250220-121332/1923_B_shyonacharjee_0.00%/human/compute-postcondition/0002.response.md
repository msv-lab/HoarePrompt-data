The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only provides information about `t`, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` is at least 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
