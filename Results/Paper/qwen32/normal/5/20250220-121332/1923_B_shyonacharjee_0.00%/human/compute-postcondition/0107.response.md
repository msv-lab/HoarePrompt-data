Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is a new input integer; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`; `i` is incremented by 1; `position` is the position value of the `i`-th monster in `monsters`; `health` is the health value of the `i`-th monster in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `success` is `False`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all the variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
