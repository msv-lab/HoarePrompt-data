The variable `time_available` is assigned the value of `distance`, which is the absolute value of `position`. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True; `position` and `health` are the `i`-th tuple values from `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`.**
