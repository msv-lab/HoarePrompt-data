Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` and `k` are new input integers; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is a new input integer; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`; `position` is the position value from the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is a new input integer; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`; `position` is the position value from the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, `success` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is a new input integer; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is the previous `total_bullets_used` plus `health`; `i` is incremented by 1; `position` is the position value of the `i`-th monster in `monsters`; `health` is the health value of the `i`-th monster in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
