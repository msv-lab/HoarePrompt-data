Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the new input; `positions` is a list of integers from the new input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True; `position` is the position value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`.**

In simple terms, the output state indicates that the variable `time_available` has been set to the value of `abs(position)`, while all other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial condition.
