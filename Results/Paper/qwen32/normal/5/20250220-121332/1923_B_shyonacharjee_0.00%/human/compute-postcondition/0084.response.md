Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is a new input integer; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is `True`; `position` is the position value from the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`.**

In this output state, the variable `distance` has been updated to hold the absolute value of `position`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
