The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable in the `for i in range(t):` statement. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the current value of i plus 1**.
