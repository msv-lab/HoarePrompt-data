Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Here are the key issues:

1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: The program does not check if the three selected sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three sides to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Specifically, for sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) (where \(a_i \le a_j \le a_k\)), the condition \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\) must be satisfied.

2. **Logic for Counting Triangles**: The program incorrectly calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks. It counts combinations without considering the triangle inequality. For example, it counts all combinations of three sticks with the same length, which is incorrect unless the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality.

3. **Incorrect Break Condition**: The program includes a break condition `if j > 1000: break` which is arbitrary and does not serve any logical purpose in the context of solving the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            k = i + 2
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                while k < n and (1 << a[i]) + (1 << a[j]) > (1 << a[k]):
                    k += 1
                count += k - j - 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the list of stick lengths and uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently count the number of valid triangles.
