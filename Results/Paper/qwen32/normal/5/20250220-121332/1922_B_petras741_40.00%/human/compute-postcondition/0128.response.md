The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `eta`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `eta` will now include the current value of `j` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers with length `n`, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j`, `j` is 0, and `q[j]` is greater than 0.**
