The code snippet provided initializes a new dictionary `q` without affecting any of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is an empty dictionary.**
