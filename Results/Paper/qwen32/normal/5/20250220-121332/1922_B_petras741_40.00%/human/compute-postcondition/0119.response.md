The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`. The value at `q[w[j]]` will be incremented by 1, meaning that the element at the position specified by `w[j]` in `q` will now hold the value 1 (if it was 0 before) or will be incremented by 1 if it already held a value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.**
