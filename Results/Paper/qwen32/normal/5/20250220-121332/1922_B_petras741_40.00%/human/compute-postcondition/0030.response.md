Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `buffer` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer with a value greater than or equal to 3.
- `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`.
- `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0.
- `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.
- `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. The current value of `eta_ln` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is calculating the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of `n` elements, which is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). This formula is expressed as:

\[ \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \]

The `//` operator in Python ensures integer division, which is appropriate for this calculation.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the integer value of the combination \( \binom{n}{3} \).

### Final Answer:
Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the input integer greater than or equal to 3)**
