### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining in which year the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The key steps in the program are as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input in one go and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining signs. For each sign `i` (from 1 to n-1):
     - It calculates the next year `next_year` when the i-th sign will occur after the previous sign (`last_year`). This is done using the formula:
       \[
       \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
       \]
       This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
     - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it stores the final `last_year` in the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the first example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Processing:
    - `last_year = 3` (first sign)
    - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (second sign)
    - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (third sign)
    - `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (fourth sign)
    - `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (fifth sign)
    - `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (sixth sign)
  - Output: `36`

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above reasoning and verification, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
