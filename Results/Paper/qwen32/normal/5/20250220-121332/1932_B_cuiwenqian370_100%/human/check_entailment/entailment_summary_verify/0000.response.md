### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the key aspects to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year of the N-th Sign:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the first sign's occurrence year, which is `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the final year for each test case to the `results` list.
   - It then prints all the results, one per line.

### Verification with Provided Examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Output: `36`
   - Explanation:
     - First sign: 3
     - Second sign: 4 (next multiple of 2 after 3)
     - Third sign: 8 (next multiple of 4 after 4)
     - Fourth sign: 10 (next multiple of 5 after 8)
     - Fifth sign: 18 (next multiple of 9 after 10)
     - Sixth sign: 36 (next multiple of 18 after 18)
   - The output matches the expected result.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation:
     - First sign: 1
     - Second sign: 2 (next multiple of 2 after 1)
     - Third sign: 3 (next multiple of 3 after 2)
     - Fourth sign: 4 (next multiple of 4 after 3)
     - Fifth sign: 5 (next multiple of 5 after 4)
   - The output matches the expected result.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation:
     - All signs occur every year, so the 5th sign occurs in the 5th year.
   - The output matches the expected result.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Output: `2012`
   - Explanation:
     - Calculating the occurrence years step-by-step matches the expected result.
   - The output matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur for each test case based on the given periodicities. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description, and the provided examples confirm the correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
