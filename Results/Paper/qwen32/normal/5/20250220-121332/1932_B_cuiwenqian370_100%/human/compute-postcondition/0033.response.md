The code snippet calculates the value of `next_year` based on the current value of `last_year`, `a[i]`, and the state of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` has already been incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged. The calculation for `next_year` does not affect `i` or `n`, so we only need to determine the new value of `next_year`.

The formula for `next_year` is:
\[ \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) * a[i] \]

Simplifying the formula:
\[ \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + a[i]}{a[i]}\right) * a[i] \]
\[ \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year}}{a[i]} + 1\right) * a[i] \]
\[ \text{next\_year} = \frac{\text{last\_year}}{a[i]} * a[i] + a[i] \]
\[ \text{next\_year} = \text{last\_year} + a[i] \]

Thus, `next_year` is the sum of `last_year` and `a[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is unchanged, `next_year` is `last_year + a[i]`**.
