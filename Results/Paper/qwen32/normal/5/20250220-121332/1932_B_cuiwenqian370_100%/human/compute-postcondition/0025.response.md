The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `T`, `n`) remain unchanged. Since `index` is incremented, `n` will now hold the value of `int(data[index])` in the next iteration, but for the current state, only `index` is affected.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` now includes `str(last_year)` as its last element, `T` must be greater than the current number of iterations, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `index` is incremented by 1.**
