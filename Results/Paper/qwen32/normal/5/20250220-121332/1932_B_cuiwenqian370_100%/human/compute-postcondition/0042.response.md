Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` includes `str(last_year)` as its last element and now also includes another `str(last_year)` as its new last element; `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `index` is incremented by 1; `a` is derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the next multiple of `a[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `last_year` after the previous iteration; `_` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, `index` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
