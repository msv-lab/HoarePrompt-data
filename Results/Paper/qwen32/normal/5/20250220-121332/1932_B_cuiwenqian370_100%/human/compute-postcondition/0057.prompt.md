Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    last_year = a[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
        last_year = next_year
    results.append(str(last_year))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is unchanged; `results` now includes `str(last_year)` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is unchanged; `results` includes `str(last_year)` as its last element and now also includes another `str(last_year)` as its new last element; `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is unchanged; `index` is incremented by `n`; `a` is derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the next multiple of `a[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `last_year` after the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `last_year` is updated to the result of the nested calculation \(\left(\left(\left(\ldots \left(\left(\text{initial\_last\_year} + a[1]\right) // a[1]\right) * a[1] + a[2]\right) // a[2]\right) * a[2] + \ldots + a[n-1]\right) // a[n-1] \right) * a[n-1]\); `results` includes the string representation of `last_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
