Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 0; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In natural language: The value of `T` is now the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which was accessed using the `index` variable. The values of `t`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged.
