The given code snippet updates the list `a` by mapping the elements from `data[index:index + n]` to integers. Here is the output state after the code execution:

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` includes `str(last_year)` as its last element and now also includes another `str(last_year)` as its new last element; `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `index` is incremented by 1; `a` is derived from `data[index:index + n]` and now contains the integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is the next multiple of `a[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the value of `last_year` after the previous iteration; `_` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms:
- `t` remains the same.
- `results` still has its last two elements as `str(last_year)`.
- `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations.
- `n` remains as `int(data[index])`.
- `index` is incremented by 1.
- `a` is now a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `last_year` remains as the next multiple of `a[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
