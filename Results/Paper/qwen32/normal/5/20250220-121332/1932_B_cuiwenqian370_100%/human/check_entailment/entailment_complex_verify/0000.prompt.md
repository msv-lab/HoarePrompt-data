You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - First line: Number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case:
     - First line: Number of signs `n`.
     - Second line: `n` integers representing the periodicity of each sign.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur.

### Logic:
- Start from the first sign's occurrence year (`a[0]`).
- For each subsequent sign, find the next occurrence year that is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence year.
- The next occurrence year can be found by calculating the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than the last occurrence year.

### Provided Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
```

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's occurrence year.
- For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and is strictly greater than `last_year`.
- It appends the final year for each test case to the results list and prints the results.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided example inputs and see if the program works correctly:
1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Output: `36`
   - Explanation:
     - First sign: 3
     - Second sign: 4 (next multiple of 2 after 3)
     - Third sign: 8 (next multiple of 4 after 4)
     - Fourth sign: 10 (next multiple of 5 after 8)
     - Fifth sign: 18 (next multiple of 9 after 10)
     - Sixth sign: 36 (next multiple of 18 after 18)
   - The output matches the expected result.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation:
     - First sign: 1
     - Second sign: 2 (next multiple of 2 after 1)
     - Third sign: 3 (next multiple of 3 after 2)
     - Fourth sign: 4 (next multiple of 4 after 3)
     - Fifth sign: 5 (next multiple of 5 after 4)
   - The output matches the expected result.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation:
     - All signs occur every year, so the 5th sign occurs in the 5th year.
   - The output matches the expected result.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Output: `2012`
   - Explanation:
     - Calculating the occurrence years step-by-step matches the expected result.
   - The output matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program handles the provided examples correctly and follows the logic described in the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or incorrect calculations in the provided code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur for each test case based on the given periodicities.
