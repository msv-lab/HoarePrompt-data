Let's analyze the given task step by step:

- We are dealing with a `for` loop that iterates over a range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`.
- The loop head involves the variable `i`, and `n` is the upper bound of the range.
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
  - `i` is `i + 1`
  - `next_year` is `((last_year + a[i]) // a[i]) * a[i]`
  - `last_year` is `next_year`

We need to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration such that the loop can execute one more time. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration.
   - `n` remains constant throughout the loop.

2. **Adjustments Required:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it follows that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1` from the previous iteration).

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - The new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 1` (which is the current value of `i`).
   - `n` should remain the same, and it should be greater than `i + 1`.

### Final State:

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`

The values of `next_year` and `last_year` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted according to the loop head requirements. However, for completeness, we can note that `next_year` and `last_year` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
