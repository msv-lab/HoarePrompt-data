The for loop provided is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 1, as the range function in Python requires the stop parameter (`n` in this case) to be greater than the start parameter (which is 1). The variable `i` is initialized to 1 and will increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.

The state provided includes several other variables (`t`, `results`, `T`, `data`, `index`, `a`, `last_year`), but we can only adjust `i` and `n` according to the loop head.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 1. The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is set by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `results` now includes `str(last_year)` as its last element, `T` must be greater than the current number of iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `index` is incremented by `n`, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`, `last_year` is `a[0]`**
