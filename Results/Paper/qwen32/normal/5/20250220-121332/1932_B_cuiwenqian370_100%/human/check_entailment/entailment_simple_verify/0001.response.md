### Reasoning:
The provided code and the original assessment both seem to accurately follow the problem's requirements. Let's systematically verify the logic and the annotations to ensure correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of intervals `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year of Each Sign:**
   - The first sign occurs in the year equal to its interval `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, the code calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs at the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - The annotations confirm that `last_year` is updated correctly for each sign.

3. **Verification with Example:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly verified by the code.
   - For the first test case with `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`, the code calculates the correct sequence of years: `3, 4, 8, 10, 18, 36`.
   - The annotations show the state of the program after processing each test case, which matches the expected behavior.

4. **Output:**
   - The results for all test cases are collected in a list and printed in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs according to the problem statement. The annotations provide a clear trace of the program's state, which aligns with the expected behavior. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
