Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes multiple test cases, calculates the year each subsequent sign occurs based on the previous sign's occurrence year, and outputs the year when the last sign occurs, indicating the apocalypse.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities.
3. It initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity.
4. For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by determining the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than `last_year`.
5. It updates `last_year` to the calculated next occurrence year.
6. After processing all signs for a test case, it stores the final `last_year` in the results list.
7. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

This approach ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem statement.
