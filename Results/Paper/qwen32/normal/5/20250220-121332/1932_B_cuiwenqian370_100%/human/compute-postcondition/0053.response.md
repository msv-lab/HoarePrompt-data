To determine the output state, let's analyze the code snippet and the impact on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`

Code snippet:
```python
next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
```

From the code snippet, `next_year` is calculated based on the value of `last_year`, `a[i]`, and `i`. The value of `i` is already incremented in the initial state, so we use this incremented value in the calculation.

The expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` simplifies to `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. This means `next_year` will be the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + a[i]`.

Since the value of `n` is not directly affected by the code snippet, it remains `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (where `i` has already been incremented).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` (with `i` already incremented), and `next_year` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + a[i]`.
