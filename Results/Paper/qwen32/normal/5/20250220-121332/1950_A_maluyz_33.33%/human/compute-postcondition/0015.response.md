Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input. If `a < b < c`, then the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. Otherwise, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, no further changes are made. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal and do not satisfy `a < b < c`, then the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `b` (if `b` is the largest) or one of `a` or `c` (if `b` is not the largest).**
