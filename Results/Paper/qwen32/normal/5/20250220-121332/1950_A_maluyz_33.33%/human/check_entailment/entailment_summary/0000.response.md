Reasoning: 

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the problem description. 

- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair and prints 'STAIR' if true.
- It checks if `b` is the maximum of the three integers to determine if the digits form a peak and prints 'PEAK' if true.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a minor issue in the program: the condition `elif a == b == c: print('NONE')` is redundant because the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b: print('PEAK')` will not be true when `a == b == c` because `b` would not be the maximum in such a case. The program will correctly print 'NONE' in this scenario due to the `else: print('NONE')` statement. Therefore, the program is still correct without this redundant condition.

Correctness: **True**
