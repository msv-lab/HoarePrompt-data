Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer input value where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
3. It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
4. `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal.
5. The maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.

### Analysis:
- The condition `a < b < c` is false, meaning the sequence of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not strictly increasing.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all the same value, so there is at least one pair of distinct values among them.
- The maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`, so either `a` or `c` (or both) must be greater than `b`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('NONE')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `t`. The string `'NONE'` is directly printed regardless of the input values.

### Output:
Output: **NONE**
