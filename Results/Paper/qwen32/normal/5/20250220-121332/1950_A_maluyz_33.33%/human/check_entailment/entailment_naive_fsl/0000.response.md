Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem description does not specify a special case for when all three digits are equal. The conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" should be sufficient to cover all cases. Additionally, the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is not sufficient to determine if the digits form a "PEAK" because it does not ensure that `a < b > c`. 

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `NONE`
- Actual Output: `PEAK`

The program incorrectly identifies `1 1 2` as a "PEAK" because `max(1, 1, 2) == 2`, which satisfies the condition `max(a, b, c) == b`. However, it should output "NONE" because `1 1 2` does not satisfy the "PEAK" condition `a < b > c`.

A corrected version of the program should look like this:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version correctly handles all cases as specified in the problem description.
