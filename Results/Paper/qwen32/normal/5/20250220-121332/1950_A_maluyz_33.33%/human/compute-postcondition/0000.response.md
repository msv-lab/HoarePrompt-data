The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer input value, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input value, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**
