The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` is given, but the code only affects `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `a`, `b`, and `c` is not directly evaluated or modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In simpler terms: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `t` remains the same, and `i` is incremented by 1. The condition about `a`, `b`, and `c` is not altered by this code snippet.
