Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The condition checks if the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, but the postcondition does not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i` based on this condition.**
