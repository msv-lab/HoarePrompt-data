The code concatenates the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 98, the ASCII value 98 corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, `s` changes from 'AF' to 'AFb'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 'AFb', and `j` is 98**.
