The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 99, `chr(99)` is 'c'. Therefore, the string `s` changes from 'bb' to 'bbc'.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` must be at least 3, `s` is 'bbc', `i` is 4, `j` is 99**.
