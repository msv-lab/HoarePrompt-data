The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 97`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` must be at least 0, and `s` is a string containing the character `chr(j)`. Since `i` is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted.

The loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `j_end`. At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_end + 1`. For the loop to continue executing, `j_end + 1` must be less than `k + 97`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `j_end` from the previous iteration, we can only express the state in terms of `j` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` must be at least 0, `s` is a string containing the character `chr(j)`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

However, to be more specific and adhere to the format given in the examples, let's assume `j_end` was `j` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be `j_end + 1`.

Given that `i` is not part of the loop head, it remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` must be at least 0, `s` is a string containing the character `chr(j)`, `i` is 4, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Since we need to provide a concrete state, let's assume `j_end` was 97 (the starting value of `j` in the loop). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be 98.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` must be at least 0, `s` is a string containing the character `chr(98)`, `i` is 4, `j` is 98**. 

This assumes that `j` started at 97 in the first iteration. If `j` was a different value at the end of the previous iteration, adjust `j` accordingly by incrementing it by 1. 

Given the problem statement, the most accurate and general form of the state at the start of the next iteration, without specific knowledge of `j_end`, would be:

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` must be at least 0, `s` is a string containing the character `chr(j)`, `i` is 4, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

However, for the sake of providing a concrete example, assuming `j` started at 97:

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` must be at least 0, `s` is a string containing the character `chr(98)`, `i` is 4, `j` is 98**.
