### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code to see if it meets the problem description.

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - The field dimensions `N` and `M` are read.
   - The field is parsed to find the positions of the red goals (`rg`), blue goals (`bg`), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and players (`player`).
   - Variables `carry` (to track which player is carrying the Quaffle), `bs` (blue team score), and `rs` (red team score) are initialized.

2. **Processing Each Step:**
   - For each step, the entity and the action are read.
   - If the action is 'C' (catch), the player is set as the carrier of the Quaffle.
   - If the action is 'T' (throw), the Quaffle is placed at the player's position, and the score is updated if the Quaffle is in a goal. The Quaffle is then moved to the center of the field.
   - If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, `func_1` is called to update their positions.
   - If the entity is a player, `func_1` is called to update their position, `func_2` is called to check for eliminations, and if the player is carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position is updated to match the player's.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function updates the coordinates of an entity based on the direction provided ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if any players are at the same position as the Bludger. If so, it marks them as eliminated by setting their position to `[-1, -1]` and prints the elimination event.

### Validation Against Problem Description:

- **Initialization:**
  - The code correctly initializes the field and all entities.
  
- **Processing Each Step:**
  - The code correctly handles the actions 'C' and 'T' for players.
  - The code correctly updates the positions of the Quaffle and Bludger.
  - The code correctly updates the positions of players and checks for eliminations.
  - The code correctly updates the score when a goal is scored.
  
- **Functions `func_1` and `func_2`:**
  - `func_1` correctly updates the coordinates of an entity based on the direction.
  - `func_2` correctly identifies and eliminates players who collide with the Bludger.

The code appears to handle all the required functionalities as per the problem description. The logic and flow of the program seem to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
