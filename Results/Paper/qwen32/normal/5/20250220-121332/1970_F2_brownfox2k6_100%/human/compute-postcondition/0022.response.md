Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a non-negative integer representing the current time step. It also accepts a parameter `player`, which is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers and values are their positions on the field (as lists of two integers). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `blud`, which is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field. The function returns the updated positions of the players after considering the influence of the Bludger at the current time step `t`.**
