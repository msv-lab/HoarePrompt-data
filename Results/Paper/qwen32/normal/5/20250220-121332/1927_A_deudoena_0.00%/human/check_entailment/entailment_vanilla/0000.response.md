Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells in the strip white. Given a string `s` of 'W' and 'B', we need to find the smallest segment that, when painted white, results in the entire string being 'W'.

### Key Points:

1. **Identify the Extremes:**
   - The earliest black cell (`'B'`) from the left side.
   - The latest black cell (`'B'`) from the right side.

2. **Calculate the Segment Length:**
   - The minimum segment length needed to cover all black cells is the distance between the earliest and latest black cells plus one (to include both ends).

### Program Analysis:

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
```

Let's break down what the program does:

1. **Finding `ind1`:**
   - The program iterates through the string from left to right to find the index of the first occurrence of `'B'`.
   - This is stored in `ind1`.

2. **Finding `ind2`:**
   - The program iterates through the string from right to left to find the index of the first occurrence of `'B'`.
   - This is stored in `ind2`, but it is actually storing the distance from the end of the string to the first `'B'` encountered from the right.

3. **Calculating the Segment Length:**
   - The program calculates the segment length as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
   - This calculation is intended to find the length between the first and last `'B'` (inclusive).

### Issues in the Program:

- **Correctness of `ind2`:** The variable `ind2` is not correctly representing the index of the last `'B'` but rather the distance from the end of the string to the last `'B'`. This is incorrect for calculating the segment length.
- **Output Calculation:** The calculation `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` is incorrect because `ind2` is not the index of the last `'B'`.

### Correct Approach:

To fix the program, we need to correctly identify the index of the last `'B'` and then calculate the segment length as `ind_last_B - ind_first_B + 1`.

### Correct Program:

```python
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = inpstr.find('B')  # First occurrence of 'B'
    ind2 = inpstr.rfind('B')  # Last occurrence of 'B'
    print(ind2 - ind1 + 1)

# Example usage:
# Assuming input is already provided in the format described in the problem.
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the segment length.

**Correctness: False**
