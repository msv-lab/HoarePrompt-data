You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in s.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: - `ind1` will be the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.
    #- `ind2` remains 0.
    #- `outind` remains 0.
    #- `i` and `j` will be the last checked index and character, but they are not relevant to the final output state as the loop breaks immediately upon finding 'B'.
    #
    #Output State:
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the first 'B' from the end of `inpstr`, and `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, excluding these two 'B's (where ind1 is the index of the first 'B' from the start and ind2 is the index of the first 'B' from the end)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string `s` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', finds the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, and prints the number of characters between these two 'B's, excluding the 'B's themselves.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells in a strip white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Key Points:
1. **Identify the first and last black cells**: The minimum segment that needs to be painted white will start from the first black cell and end at the last black cell.
2. **Calculate the segment length**: The length of this segment is the distance between the first and last black cells plus one (since it's inclusive).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program is designed to find the indices of the first and last black cells and then calculate the length of the segment between them.

1. **Finding the first black cell**:
   ```python
   for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
       if j == 'B':
           ind1 = i
           break
   ```
   This loop correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the input string `inpstr`.

2. **Finding the last black cell**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(inpstr)):
       if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
           ind2 = i
           break
   ```
   This loop correctly identifies the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the input string `inpstr`. The index is calculated as `len(inpstr) - i - 1`.

3. **Calculating the segment length**:
   ```python
   print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
   ```
   The length of the segment is calculated as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`. This is correct because `ind2` is the distance from the end of the string to the last black cell, and `ind1` is the index of the first black cell. The length of the segment is thus the total length of the string minus the distance from the end to the last black cell minus the index of the first black cell.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem statement:

- Input: `WBBWBW`
- First black cell index (`ind1`): 1
- Last black cell index (`ind2`): 4 (from the end, it's 1, so `len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1 = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4`)
- Calculated segment length: `6 - 1 - 4 + 1 = 4` (Note: The correct calculation should be `6 - 1 - 4 + 1 = 4` which is correct, but the program directly uses `6 - 4 - 1 = 1` which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `6 - 1 - 4 + 1 = 4`).

However, the program is actually correct in calculating the segment length as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` which is `6 - 4 - 1 + 1 = 4`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the first and last black cells and calculates the minimum segment length that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.

**Correctness: True**
