Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`, `inpstr` is a non-empty string, `outind` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `inpstr[2]`. If `j` is 'B', then `ind1` is 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ind1` retains its initial value of 0.**
