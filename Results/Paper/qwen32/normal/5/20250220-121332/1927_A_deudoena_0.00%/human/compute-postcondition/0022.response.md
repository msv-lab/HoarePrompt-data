Postcondition: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is `i` if the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` remains 0, and `inpstr` must have at least one character. If the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
