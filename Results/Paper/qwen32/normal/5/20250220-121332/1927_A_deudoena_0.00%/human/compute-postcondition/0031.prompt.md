Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - `ind1` will be the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.
- `ind2` remains 0.
- `outind` remains 0.
- `i` and `j` will be the last checked index and character, but they are not relevant to the final output state as the loop breaks immediately upon finding 'B'.

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(inpstr)):
    if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
        ind2 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is `i` if the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` remains 0, and `inpstr` must have at least one character. If the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is `i` if the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` remains 0, `inpstr` must have at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', the loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `outind` remains 0, `inpstr` must have at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at the position `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B', then `ind2` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ind2` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
