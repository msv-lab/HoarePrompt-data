Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The code finds the first and last black cell in the string and calculates the distance between them, but this does not guarantee that painting this segment will make the entire strip white.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
BBWBB
```
The correct answer should be 5 because painting the entire segment will make all cells white. However, the code will output 3, which is incorrect because it only considers the distance between the first and last black cell, not the entire segment that needs to be painted.

Another incorrect case:
```
6
BWBWWB
```
The correct answer is 6, but the code will output 4, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve finding the longest continuous segment of black cells and painting that segment white, or in other words, finding the maximum distance between any two black cells that are contiguous. The provided code does not handle this correctly.
