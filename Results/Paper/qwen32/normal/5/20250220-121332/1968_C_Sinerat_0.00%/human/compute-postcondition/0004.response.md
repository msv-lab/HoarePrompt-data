The code snippet modifies the first element of the list `a` by setting it to 500. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `a` was initially a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. After the modification, the first element of `a` is now 500, while the rest of the elements remain 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500 and the rest are 0.**
