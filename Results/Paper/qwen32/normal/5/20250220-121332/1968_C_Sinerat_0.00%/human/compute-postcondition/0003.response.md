The code snippet creates a new list `a` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0.**
