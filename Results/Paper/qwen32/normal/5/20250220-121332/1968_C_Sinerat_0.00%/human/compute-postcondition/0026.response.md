The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the loop. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. Since `_` is incremented in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

Given that `_` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented to 1. The variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the `i`-th element is the sum of 500 and the first `i-1` elements of `x`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified; `_` is 1; `i` is `n`**
