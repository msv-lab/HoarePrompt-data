You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided program and check if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The program is as follows:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Array `a` Requirements:**
   - \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
   - \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

2. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` of length `n-1`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output any array `a` that satisfies the conditions.

### Analysis:
- The program initializes `a[0]` to 500, which is within the required range.
- For each subsequent element `a[i]`, it calculates `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

### Potential Issues:
- The main issue is that the program does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.
- Let's consider an example to see why this is the case.

### Example:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
1 1
```

- According to the program:
  - \(a[0] = 500\)
  - \(a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + 1 = 501\)
  - \(a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 501 + 1 = 502\)

- Now, we need to check if \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\):
  - \(x_1 = 1\) should be equal to \(a_1 \bmod a_0 = 501 \bmod 500 = 1\) (This is correct).
  - \(x_2 = 1\) should be equal to \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 502 \bmod 501 = 1\) (This is correct).

However, this example seems to work. Let's consider another example where it might fail:

### Another Example:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3
```

- According to the program:
  - \(a[0] = 500\)
  - \(a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + 2 = 502\)
  - \(a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 502 + 3 = 505\)

- Now, we need to check if \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\):
  - \(x_1 = 2\) should be equal to \(a_1 \bmod a_0 = 502 \bmod 500 = 2\) (This is correct).
  - \(x_2 = 3\) should be equal to \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 505 \bmod 502 = 3\) (This is correct).

### Conclusion:
The program seems to work for the provided examples. However, the logic used in the program is not robust enough to guarantee that it will work for all possible inputs. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the chosen `a[0]` and the subsequent `a[i]` values will always satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\). For instance, if `x[i]` is larger than `a[i-1]`, the program will not handle it correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
501 501
```

- According to the program:
  - \(a[0] = 500\)
  - \(a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + 501 = 1001\)
  - \(a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1001 + 501 = 1502\)

- Now, we need to check if \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\):
  - \(x_1 = 501\) should be equal to \(a_1 \bmod a_0 = 1001 \bmod 500 = 1\) (This is incorrect).

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description.
