The code snippet modifies the list `a` at index `i` by setting `a[i]` to the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, and `x[i - 1]` is `x[2]`. 

Initially, `a[2]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`. Therefore, `a[3]` becomes `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.

The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, the fourth element is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified, `_` is 0, `i` is 3**.
