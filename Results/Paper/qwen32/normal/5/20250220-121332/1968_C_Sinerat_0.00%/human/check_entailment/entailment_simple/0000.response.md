### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The provided program initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then calculates each subsequent element `a[i]` as the cumulative sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding value `x[i-1]`.

However, this approach does not guarantee that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` for all `i`. Let's analyze why:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**: The program sets `a[0]` to 500, which is within the allowed range (1 to 10^9).
2. **Calculation of `a[i]`**: For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the program sets `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

This method does not ensure that `a[i] % a[i-1]` equals `x[i]` because the cumulative sum approach does not inherently satisfy the modular condition. For example, if `a[i-1]` is 500 and `x[i-1]` is 2, `a[i]` would be 502, and `502 % 500` equals 2, which is correct. However, this is not guaranteed for all values of `x[i]`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that `a[i]` is chosen such that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]`. One straightforward way to do this is to set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` if `x[i-1] < a[i-1]`, or to set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + k * a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for some integer `k` if `x[i-1] >= a[i-1]`. However, the simplest and correct approach is to set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` if `x[i-1] < a[i-1]`, and to set `a[i]` to `x[i-1] + a[i-1]` if `x[i-1] >= a[i-1]`, ensuring that `a[i] % a[i-1] == x[i]` always holds.

Given the provided program, the approach used does not guarantee the modular condition for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
