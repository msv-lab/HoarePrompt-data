To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500.
- For `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is calculated as `500 + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`.

### Analysis:
1. **First Element (`a[0]`)**:
   - `a[0]` is explicitly given as 500.

2. **Subsequent Elements (`a[i]` for `1 <= i < n`)**:
   - `a[i]` is calculated as `500 + sum(a[0] to a[i-1])`.
   - Let's calculate the first few elements to identify a pattern.

   - **For `i = 1`**:
     - `a[1] = 500 + sum(a[0]) = 500 + 500 = 1000`

   - **For `i = 2`**:
     - `a[2] = 500 + sum(a[0] to a[1]) = 500 + (500 + 1000) = 500 + 1500 = 2000`

   - **For `i = 3`**:
     - `a[3] = 500 + sum(a[0] to a[2]) = 500 + (500 + 1000 + 2000) = 500 + 3500 = 4000`

   - **General Pattern**:
     - `a[i] = 500 * 2^(i)`

### Conclusion:
- The list `a` starts with 500, and each subsequent element is double the previous element plus 500.
- The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Output:
Based on the pattern and the initial state, the list `a` will be `[500, 1000, 2000, 4000, ...]` up to `n` elements.

Output: **500 1000 2000 4000 ... (where the list `a` is defined such that `a[0] = 500` and `a[i] = 500 * 2^i` for `1 <= i < n`)**
