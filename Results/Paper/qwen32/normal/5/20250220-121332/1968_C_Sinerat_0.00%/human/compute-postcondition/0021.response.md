The code snippet modifies the `i`-th element of the list `a` by setting it to the value of the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` plus the `(i-1)`-th element of `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`.

Initially, `a[0]` is 500, and `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, which is `500 + x[0]`. Therefore, `a[2]` becomes `(500 + x[0]) + x[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified; `_` is 0; `i` is 2**.
