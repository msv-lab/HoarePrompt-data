The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which means the loop will run a certain number of times regardless of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `a`).

Since the loop head only involves the iteration variable `_`, and it is not influenced by the other variables, the state of `_` is what we need to consider. However, `_` is not explicitly modified or checked within the loop head, so we can infer that the loop will simply decrement the iteration count by 1 each time it runs.

Given the loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`, at the start of each iteration, `_` will take on the next value in the range sequence. Since the loop is about to start, `_` will be the first value in the sequence, which is `0` if the range is from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted in terms of the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, or `a` because they are not part of the loop head. The only consideration is the iteration variable `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500; `_` is 0**
