Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500 and the rest are set to 0; `_` is 0.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified so that its first element is now 500, while all other elements remain 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged.
