Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
2. `n` is the first integer from the input.
3. `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4.
4. `nums` is defined as the following list: `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5]`.
5. `idx` is 2.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(nums))
```

### Analysis:
- The list `nums` contains 26 elements explicitly listed, and three additional elements derived from `k`: `k - 4`, `k + 1`, and `k + 5`.
- Since `k` is between 4 and 7 (inclusive), the three additional elements will be valid integers.
- Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` will be 29.

### Conclusion:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will output the length of the `nums` list, which is 29.

### Final Output:
Output: **29**
