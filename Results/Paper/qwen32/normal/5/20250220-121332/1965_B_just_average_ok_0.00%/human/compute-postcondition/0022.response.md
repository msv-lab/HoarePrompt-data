To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop condition `k >= 1 << idx`. Here, `1 << idx` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to \(2^{\text{idx}}\).

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable does not affect the loop condition, so we can ignore it).
- `n` is the first integer from the input (this variable does not affect the loop condition, so we can ignore it).
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4.
- `nums` is a predefined list (this variable does not affect the loop condition, so we can ignore it).
- `idx` is 0.

The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`, which translates to `k >= 2^idx`. Since `idx` is 0 initially, the condition becomes `k >= 2^0`, or `k >= 1`.

Since `k` is defined to be at least 4, the condition `k >= 1` is always true. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once with the initial state provided.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the state of `k` or `idx` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`; `idx` is 0**
