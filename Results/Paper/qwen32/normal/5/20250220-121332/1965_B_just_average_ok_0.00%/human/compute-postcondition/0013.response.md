The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Given that `k` is an integer such that 4 ≤ k < 8, `k + 1` will be an integer between 5 and 8. The initial list `nums` contains 25 elements, and after the append operation, it will contain 26 elements.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The list `nums` is updated to include the new element `k + 1` at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1]`; `idx` is 2.**
