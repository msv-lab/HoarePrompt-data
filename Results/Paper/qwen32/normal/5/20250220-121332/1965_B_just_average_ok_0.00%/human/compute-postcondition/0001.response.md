The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State will include the new values of `n` and `k` along with the unchanged value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
