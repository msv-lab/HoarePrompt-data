Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input. It is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input, and it must be less than 8 but at least 4. Therefore, `k` can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.
   - `nums` is a predefined list that contains the following elements:
     - The first 24 elements are powers of 2: `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`
     - The last three elements are based on the value of `k`: `[k - 2, k + 1, k + 3]`
   - `idx` is 1, but it is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **Constructing the `nums` list:**
   - The first 24 elements of `nums` are fixed: `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`
   - The last three elements depend on the value of `k`:
     - If `k = 4`, then the last three elements are `[2, 5, 7]`
     - If `k = 5`, then the last three elements are `[3, 6, 8]`
     - If `k = 6`, then the last three elements are `[4, 7, 9]`
     - If `k = 7`, then the last three elements are `[5, 8, 10]`

3. **The print statement:**
   - The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the `nums` list separated by spaces.

4. **Determining the output:**
   - Given the possible values of `k`, we can construct the `nums` list for each case and determine the output.

Let's consider all possible values of `k`:

- If `k = 4`, `nums` will be: `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 2, 5, 7]`
- If `k = 5`, `nums` will be: `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 3, 6, 8]`
- If `k = 6`, `nums` will be: `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 4, 7, 9]`
- If `k = 7`, `nums` will be: `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 5, 8, 10]`

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **1 2 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 8388608 k-2 k+1 k+3 (where k is an integer such that 4 ≤ k < 8)**
