Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using the minimum number of cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each cyclic shift is equal to the length of the substring being shifted.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cost` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0. This variable counts the number of '1's encountered so far in the string.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0 (meaning there are '1's before this '0'), add `one + 1` to the `cost`. The `+1` accounts for the cost of the substring that includes the current '0' and all the '1's before it.

3. **Return the cost**:
   - After processing all characters in the string, the function returns the `cost`.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify if the function correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string.

- **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Second character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Final `cost = 2`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
  - The string is already sorted, so no operations are needed, and `cost = 0`.

- **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First two characters are '1's, so `one = 2`.
  - Third character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - Fifth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 9`.
  - Final `cost = 9`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Second character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Third character is '1', so `one = 2`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 5`.
  - Fifth character is '1', so `one = 3`.
  - Sixth character is '1', so `one = 4`.
  - Final `cost = 5`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - Second character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Third character is '1', so `one = 2`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Fifth character is '1', so `one = 3`.
  - Sixth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 3 + 1 = 7`.
  - Seventh character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 3 + 1 = 11`.
  - Final `cost = 11`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **True**
