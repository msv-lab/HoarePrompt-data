### Reasoning:

The program is intended to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift operation is defined as the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided function `func_1` calculates the cost by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of consecutive '1's. Whenever it encounters a '0' after one or more '1's, it adds the count of consecutive '1's plus one to the total cost.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cost` is initialized to 0. This variable will accumulate the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0 (indicating that there have been consecutive '1's before this '0'), add `one + 1` to `cost` and reset `one` to 0. The `one + 1` term represents the cost of shifting the segment of consecutive '1's to the right of this '0' into a position where they can be sorted properly.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns the accumulated `cost`, which is the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the function with the given example:

- **First Test Case: "10"**
  - The string is "10".
  - `one` becomes 1 after encountering '1'.
  - When '0' is encountered, `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - The function returns 2, which matches the expected output.

- **Second Test Case: "0000"**
  - The string is "0000".
  - There are no '1's, so `one` remains 0.
  - The function returns 0, which matches the expected output.

- **Third Test Case: "11000"**
  - The string is "11000".
  - `one` becomes 2 after encountering "11".
  - When '0' is encountered, `cost` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
  - This process repeats for the next '0's, adding 3 to `cost` each time.
  - The total cost is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.
  - The function returns 9, which matches the expected output.

- **Fourth Test Case: "101011"**
  - The string is "101011".
  - `one` becomes 1 after the first '1'.
  - When the first '0' is encountered, `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - `one` becomes 1 after the next '1'.
  - When the next '0' is encountered, `cost` becomes `2 + (1 + 1) = 4`.
  - `one` becomes 2 after the next "11".
  - When the next '0' is encountered, `cost` becomes `4 + (2 + 1) = 7`.
  - The function returns 7, which does not match the expected output of 5. This suggests that the logic might not be handling all edge cases correctly.

- **Fifth Test Case: "01101001"**
  - The string is "01101001".
  - `one` becomes 2 after encountering "11".
  - When the first '0' is encountered, `cost` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
  - `one` becomes 1 after the next '1'.
  - When the next '0' is encountered, `cost` becomes `3 + (1 + 1) = 5`.
  - `one` becomes 1 after the next '1'.
  - When the next '0' is encountered, `cost` becomes `5 + (1 + 1) = 7`.
  - `one` becomes 1 after the next '1'.
  - The function returns 7, which does not match the expected output of 11.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the binary string in all cases. The logic needs to be revised to ensure it correctly handles all scenarios, especially when there are multiple segments of '1's interspersed with '0's.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
