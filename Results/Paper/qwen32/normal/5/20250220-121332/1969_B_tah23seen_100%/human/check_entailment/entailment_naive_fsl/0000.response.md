Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before '0's. However, this approach does not account for the optimal cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

Consider the following counterexample:
Input:
```
1
11010
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```
Explanation of the expected output:
1. Choose substring [3, 5]: `11010` â†’ `11001` (cost = 3)

However, the function `func_1(s)` will calculate the cost as follows:
- It encounters two '1's before the first '0', so it adds `2 + 1 = 3`.
- It encounters another '1' before the second '0', so it adds `1 + 1 = 2`.
- Total cost calculated by the function: `3 + 2 = 5`.

This is incorrect because the optimal way to sort the string is to perform a single operation with a cost of 3.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible binary strings, making it incorrect.
