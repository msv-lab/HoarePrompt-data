### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic in the function `func_1` seems to be based on the idea that each transition from '1' to '0' requires a certain cost which is related to the number of consecutive '1's before the '0'. The cost calculation is done by adding the number of consecutive '1's plus one for each such transition.

However, this logic does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. The cost of a cyclic shift is defined as the length of the substring being shifted, and the goal is to make the string sorted in non-descending order with the minimum total cost.

Let's analyze the provided example:
- For the input "10", the optimal solution is to shift the whole string, resulting in a cost of 2.
- For the input "0000", the string is already sorted, so the cost is 0.
- For the input "11000", the optimal solution involves multiple shifts, but the provided logic does not correctly compute the cost.
- For the input "101011", the optimal solution involves shifts that are not accounted for by the provided logic.
- For the input "01101001", similarly, the optimal solution is not correctly computed.

The logic in `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string. It only calculates a cost based on the number of '1's followed by '0's, which is not equivalent to the minimum cost of sorting the string using cyclic shifts.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
