You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:

    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5.

    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: `s` is the original binary string, `one` is the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string if it ends with '1's, otherwise `one` is 0, and `cost` is the sum of `(number of consecutive '1's + 1)` for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string that is followed by a '0'.
    return cost
    #The program returns the cost, which is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string that is followed by a '0'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using the minimum number of cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each cyclic shift is equal to the length of the substring being shifted.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cost` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0. This variable counts the number of '1's encountered so far in the string.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0 (meaning there are '1's before this '0'), add `one + 1` to the `cost`. The `+1` accounts for the cost of the substring that includes the current '0' and all the '1's before it.

3. **Return the cost**:
   - After processing all characters in the string, the function returns the `cost`.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify if the function correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string.

- **Example 1**: `s = "10"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Second character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Final `cost = 2`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 2**: `s = "0000"`
  - The string is already sorted, so no operations are needed, and `cost = 0`.

- **Example 3**: `s = "11000"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First two characters are '1's, so `one = 2`.
  - Third character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - Fifth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 9`.
  - Final `cost = 9`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 4**: `s = "101011"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - First character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Second character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Third character is '1', so `one = 2`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 5`.
  - Fifth character is '1', so `one = 3`.
  - Sixth character is '1', so `one = 4`.
  - Final `cost = 5`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 5**: `s = "01101001"`
  - Initially, `one = 0`, `cost = 0`.
  - Second character is '1', so `one = 1`.
  - Third character is '1', so `one = 2`.
  - Fourth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Fifth character is '1', so `one = 3`.
  - Sixth character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 3 + 1 = 7`.
  - Seventh character is '0', and `one > 0`, so `cost += 3 + 1 = 11`.
  - Final `cost = 11`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shifts.
