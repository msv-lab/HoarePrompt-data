To determine what will be printed by the `print(round(a * d))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
4. `d` is calculated as `c / 2`.
5. `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.

### Calculation:
- `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. This means `d` is half of the value of `c`.
- The expression to be printed is `round(a * d)`. Since `d` is `c / 2`, we can rewrite this as `round(a * (c / 2))` or `round((a * c) / 2)`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `a * d` is `(a * c) / 2`.
- The `round` function will round this value to the nearest integer.

### Output:
The output will be the rounded value of `(a * c) / 2`.

Thus, the final output can be described as:
Output: **round((a * c) / 2)**
