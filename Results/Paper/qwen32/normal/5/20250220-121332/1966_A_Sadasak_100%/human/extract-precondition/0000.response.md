Precondition: **arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100. The length of arr (number of cards) is n, where 1 <= n <= 100. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a different n and k, and a corresponding list of integers arr.**
