The code snippet updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `num` key by 1. If the `num` key does not exist in the dictionary, it initializes it with a value of 1. The values of `arr` and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1**.
