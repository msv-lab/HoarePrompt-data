In the given for loop, the only variables in the loop head are `num` and `arr`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to ensure the loop executes.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `arr`**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must contain at least one element.
2. **Variable `num`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `arr` as the loop iterates. Before the loop starts, `num` does not need to be set to any specific value because it is assigned by the loop itself.

Given the constraints:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- The length of `arr` is `n`, where `1 <= n <= 100`.

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one integer. The value of `num` does not need to be initialized since it is set by the loop.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `arr` has at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is not initialized (it will be set by the loop)**

However, since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`num` and `arr`), and `num` does not need an initial state, we just need to ensure `arr` is properly initialized.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element**
