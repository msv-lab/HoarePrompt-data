You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to minimize the number of cards in our hand by repeatedly performing a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose `k` cards with the same number and replace them with `k-1` cards, each of which can have any number. We need to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing this operation any number of times.

### Key Observations
1. **Frequency of Cards**: To minimize the number of cards, we need to focus on the frequency of each card number. If a card number appears `f` times, we can reduce the count of this card by `f % (k-1)` after performing the operation as many times as possible.
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`. If `k` is in the frequency values, it suggests a specific scenario that needs to be handled, but the provided program does not correctly handle all cases.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of each card number. However, it incorrectly limits the frequency to `k`, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Decision Making**: The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a reliable condition to determine the minimum number of cards. The logic to calculate the minimum number of cards is incorrect.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the frequency of each card number.
2. For each frequency `f`, determine the remainder when `f` is divided by `k-1` (i.e., `f % (k-1)`).
3. The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of these remainders, with a minimum of 1 (since no operations can leave zero cards if `n > 0`).

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards. It incorrectly limits the frequency to `k` and uses an unreliable condition to decide the output.
