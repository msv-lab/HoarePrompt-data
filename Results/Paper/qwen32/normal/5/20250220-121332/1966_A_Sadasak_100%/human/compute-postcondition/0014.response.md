Output State: **`frequency_table` contains each unique number from `arr` as keys, with values representing the minimum of the number's occurrences in `arr` and `k`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `frequency_table` will have each unique number from the list `arr` as keys. The value for each key will be the count of how many times that number appears in `arr`, but it will not exceed `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`.
