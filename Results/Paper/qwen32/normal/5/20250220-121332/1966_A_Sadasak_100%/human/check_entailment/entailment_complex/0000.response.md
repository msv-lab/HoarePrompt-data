Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:** 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not the correct approach. The frequency should be computed without any upper limit, and then the operations should be simulated based on these frequencies.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k-1` if it is. This is incorrect. The correct approach involves repeatedly reducing the counts of the most frequent cards by `k` and adding `k-1` back until no more operations can be performed.

3. **Incorrect Output Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the operations. It should keep reducing the counts of the most frequent cards until no more operations can be performed and then sum the remaining counts to get the minimum number of cards left.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where no operations can be performed (i.e., when no group of `k` identical cards exists).

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
