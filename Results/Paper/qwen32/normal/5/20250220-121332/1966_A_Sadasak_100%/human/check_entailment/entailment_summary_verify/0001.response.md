Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to minimize the number of cards in our hand by repeatedly performing a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose `k` cards with the same number and replace them with `k-1` cards, each of which can have any number. We need to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing this operation any number of times.

### Key Observations
1. **Frequency of Cards**: To minimize the number of cards, we need to focus on the frequency of each card number. If a card number appears `f` times, we can reduce the count of this card by `f // (k-1)` operations, each reducing the count by `k-1`. The remaining cards will be `f % (k-1)`.
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of each card number but incorrectly limits the frequency to `k`. This limitation is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Decision Making**: The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a reliable condition to determine the minimum number of cards. The logic to calculate the minimum number of cards is incorrect.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the frequency of each card number.
2. For each frequency `f`, determine the remainder when `f` is divided by `k-1` (i.e., `f % (k-1)`).
3. The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of these remainders, with a minimum of 1 (since no operations can leave zero cards if `n > 0`).

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary states:
- The function takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr`, and each value is the minimum of the number's occurrences in `arr` and `k`.

This summary is accurate in terms of what the function does, but it does not align with the correct approach to solving the problem. The function should not limit the frequency to `k`.

### Program Evaluation
Given the incorrect logic in the program, let's re-evaluate the original assessment:

1. **Input Handling**: Correct.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: Incorrect due to the limiting of frequency to `k`.
3. **Decision Making**: Incorrect due to the unreliable condition `if k in freq.values()`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards. It incorrectly limits the frequency to `k` and uses an unreliable condition to decide the output.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
