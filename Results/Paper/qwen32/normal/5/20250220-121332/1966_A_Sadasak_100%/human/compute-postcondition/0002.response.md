The code snippet updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of `num`. If `num` is not already a key in `frequency_table`, it initializes it with a value of 0 and then increments it by 1. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, but `arr` is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element; `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1, where `num` is a key in `frequency_table` or initialized to 1 if not present.**
