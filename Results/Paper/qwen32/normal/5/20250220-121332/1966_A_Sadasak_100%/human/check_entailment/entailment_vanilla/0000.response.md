Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to minimize the number of cards in our hand by repeatedly performing a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose `k` cards with the same number and replace them with `k-1` cards, each of which can have any number. We need to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing this operation any number of times.

### Key Observations
1. **Frequency of Cards**: To minimize the number of cards, we need to focus on the frequency of each card number. If a card number appears `f` times, we can reduce the count of this card by `f % (k-1)` after performing the operation as many times as possible.
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`. If `k` is in the frequency values, it suggests a specific scenario that needs to be handled, but the provided program does not correctly handle all cases.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of each card number. However, it incorrectly limits the frequency to `k`, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Decision Making**: The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a reliable condition to determine the minimum number of cards. The logic to calculate the minimum number of cards is incorrect.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the frequency of each card number.
2. For each frequency `f`, determine the remainder when `f` is divided by `k-1` (i.e., `f % (k-1)`).
3. The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of these remainders, with a minimum of 1 (since no operations can leave zero cards if `n > 0`).

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards. It incorrectly limits the frequency to `k` and uses an unreliable condition to decide the output.

Correctness: **False**
