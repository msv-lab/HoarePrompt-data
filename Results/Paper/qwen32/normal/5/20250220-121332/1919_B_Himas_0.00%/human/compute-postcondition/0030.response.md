The code snippet `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Therefore, the value of `M` changes from 0 to 1. The values of all other variables (`t`, `s`, `e`, `P`, `i`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `i` is i + 1, and `q` is not equal to '+'**.
