Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting a given string `s` into non-empty arrays such that the sum of penalties of these arrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)
```

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the string `s` (though this length is not used in the program).
   - It reads the string `s` itself.
   - It initializes two counters, `P` and `M`, to 0.
   - It iterates over the string `s` and increments `P` for each `'+'` and `M` for each `'-'`.
   - It prints the difference `P - M`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Unused Length Input**: The length of the string `s` is read and stored in `s`, but it is not used anywhere in the program. This is not an error per se, but it is unnecessary.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'` characters in the string `s` and prints this difference. This does not correspond to the penalty calculation described in the problem. The penalty involves splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray based on the absolute value of its sum and its length.

3. **Optimal Splitting**: The program does not attempt to split the array optimally to minimize the penalty. It simply counts the number of `'+'` and `'-'` characters and prints their difference, which is not a valid approach to solving the problem.

### Correctness

Given the above points, the provided program is incorrect as it does not implement the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The program simply prints the difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'` characters, which is not related to the penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
