Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string, `P` is 0, `M` is the count of all other characters in the previous `e`, `i` is i + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `P` is set to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, `e`, `M`, and `i`) retain their previous values with the exception that `i` is incremented by 1.
