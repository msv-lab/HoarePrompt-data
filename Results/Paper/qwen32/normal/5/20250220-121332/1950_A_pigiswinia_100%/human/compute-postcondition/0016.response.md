The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`), but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 1.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print('NONE')` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NONE'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NONE**
