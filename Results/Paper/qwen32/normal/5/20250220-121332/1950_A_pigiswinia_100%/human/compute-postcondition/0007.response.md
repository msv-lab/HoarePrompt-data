The `print('PEAK')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The string 'PEAK' is explicitly provided in the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`), but the `print` statement only involves a static string.
2. The value of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are either given or not yet initialized, but none of these values affect the `print` statement.
3. The `print` function is instructed to output the string 'PEAK'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be exactly 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
