The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The initial state mentioned `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `i` is 1. These variables are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `i` is 1**.
