The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement because the string `'NONE'` is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variables `a`, `b`, and `c`**: They are integers provided by the input. The initial state specifies that it is not the case that `a < b < c` and it is not the case that `a < b > c`. However, these conditions do not influence the output of the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `i`**: It is mentioned as not yet initialized, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('NONE')`, it will output the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NONE**
