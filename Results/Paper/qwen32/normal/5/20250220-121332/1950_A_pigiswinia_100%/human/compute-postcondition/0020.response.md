The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and `i` is 2. These values are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `i` is 2**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned the values of the three integers provided by the input, and `i` remains 2.
