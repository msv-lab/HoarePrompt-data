Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program. The conditions are checked correctly, and the output is printed as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
