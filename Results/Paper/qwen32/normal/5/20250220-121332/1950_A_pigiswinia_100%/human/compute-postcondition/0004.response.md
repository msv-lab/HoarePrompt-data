The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'STAIR'`. This string is not dependent on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i` as they are not used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the exact string provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **STAIR**
