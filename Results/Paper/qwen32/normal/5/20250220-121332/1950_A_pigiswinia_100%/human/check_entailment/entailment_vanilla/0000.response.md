Reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `t` times.
3. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
4. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the first condition is false, it checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

The logic implemented in the program correctly matches the conditions specified in the problem statement:
- "STAIR" is printed when `a < b < c`.
- "PEAK" is printed when `a < b > c`.
- "NONE" is printed for all other cases.

Since the program correctly handles all specified conditions for each test case, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
