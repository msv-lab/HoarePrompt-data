The code assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; `h1` is `'10'`; `time` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; `h1` is `'10'`; `time` is an empty string.**
