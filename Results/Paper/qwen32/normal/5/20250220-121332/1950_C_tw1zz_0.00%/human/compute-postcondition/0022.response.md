The code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. This change affects only the variable `time`, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is '05', `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is '05', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `time` is 'AM', `h` is not equal to '01', `h` is not equal to '02', `h` is not equal to '03', `h` is not equal to '04', and `h` is equal to '05'.**
