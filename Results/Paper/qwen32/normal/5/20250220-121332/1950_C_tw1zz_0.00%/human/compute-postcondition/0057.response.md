Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is '02', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `time` is an empty string, `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '13', and `h` is equal to '14'**.

In simple terms, the value of `h1` has been updated to '02'. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
