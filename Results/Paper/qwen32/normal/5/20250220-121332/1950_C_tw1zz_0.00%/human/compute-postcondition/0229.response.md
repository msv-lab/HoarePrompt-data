Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; `h1` is '01'; `time` is an empty string.**

In simpler terms, after the code execution, `h1` is set to '01', while all other variables retain their initial states.
