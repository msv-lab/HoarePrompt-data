Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format.**

In simple terms, `h1` has been set to an empty string, while `m1` retains its previous value, which is the string representation of the minute part of `t`. The values of `t`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged.
