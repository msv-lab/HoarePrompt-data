Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. If `h` is '16', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '17', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '18', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
