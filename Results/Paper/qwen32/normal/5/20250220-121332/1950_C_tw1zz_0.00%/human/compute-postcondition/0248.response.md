The code snippet assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; `h1` is '10'; `time` is 'PM'.**
