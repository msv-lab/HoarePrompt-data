Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Mathematically, for each outcome \(i\), the condition is:
\[ \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j + x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]

### Program Analysis
The provided program calculates a solution as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers.
3. It calculates the product of all multipliers.
4. It calculates the list `vprod` where each element is the product of all multipliers divided by the corresponding multiplier.
5. It calculates `den` as the product of all multipliers minus the sum of `vprod`.
6. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` (indicating no solution).
7. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

### Verification
Let's verify if this approach works:
- The product of all multipliers is a common multiple of all the multipliers.
- `vprod` is essentially the product of all multipliers divided by each multiplier, which means each `vprod[i]` is the product of all other multipliers.
- The sum of `vprod` is indeed less than the product of all multipliers because each `vprod[i]` is the product of all multipliers divided by `k_i`, and there are `n` such terms. Therefore, the sum of `vprod` is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j}{k_i} = \prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i} \right) \]
Since \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i} < 1\) (because each \(k_i \geq 2\)), the sum of `vprod` is indeed less than the product of all multipliers.
- The condition `den > 0` ensures that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received in any winning scenario. Specifically, `den` is:
\[ \prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{n} k_j}{k_i} \]
This is positive if the sum of `vprod` is less than the product of all multipliers, which we have established.

### Function Summary Evaluation
The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. The function reads the input, computes the product of the multipliers, computes `vprod`, computes `den`, and prints the appropriate result based on the value of `den`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The function summary is accurate, and the program correctly handles the given constraints and requirements.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
