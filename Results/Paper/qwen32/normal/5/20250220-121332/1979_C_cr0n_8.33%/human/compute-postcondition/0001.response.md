The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `vals`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `N` is also unchanged. The new variable `vals` is introduced and assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
