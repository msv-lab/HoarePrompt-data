Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
- `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged.
- `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)` and `den` is greater than 0.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`prod` Calculation**:
   - `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`. For example, if `vals = [a, b, c]`, then `prod = a * b * c`.

2. **`vprod` Calculation**:
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - For example, if `vals = [a, b, c]` and `prod = a * b * c`, then `vprod = [prod / a, prod / b, prod / c]`.
   - This means `vprod = [b * c, a * c, a * b]`.

3. **`den` Calculation**:
   - `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - For example, if `vals = [a, b, c]`, `prod = a * b * c`, and `vprod = [b * c, a * c, a * b]`, then `den = a * b * c - (b * c + a * c + a * b)`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will join the elements of `vprod` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.
   - For example, if `vprod = [b * c, a * c, a * b]`, the output will be `b * c a * c a * b`.

### Final Output:
The output will be a string of space-separated values from the `vprod` list, where each value is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.

Output: **vprod[0] vprod[1] ... vprod[len(vals)-1] (where each vprod[i] is prod / vals[i])**
