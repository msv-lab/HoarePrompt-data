Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least two integers; `prod` is the current value of `r` multiplied by the previous value of `prod`; `r` is the next element in `vals`. The value of `prod` has been updated to `prod * r`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `prod` has been updated to the product of its previous value and the current value of `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
