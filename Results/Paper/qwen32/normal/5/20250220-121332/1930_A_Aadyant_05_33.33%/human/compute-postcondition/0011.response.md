The code snippet appends the integer value of the element at the index `2 * i` in `list1` to `list2`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we'll assume `i` is provided or defined in a previous part of the program. Let's assume `i` is a valid index such that `2 * i` is within the bounds of `list1`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string.**

In natural language: The variable `list2` now contains the integer value of the element at index `2 * i` from `list1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
