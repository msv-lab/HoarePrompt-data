The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `c`. Therefore, the list `c` will now include the element `a[i]` as its last element. The values of `t`, `a`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element.**
