The code snippet `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged. Here, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` includes `y` at the end of the list and now also includes `x` at the end of the list.**
