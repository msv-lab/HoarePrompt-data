You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers, potentially splitting elements greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, and checks if the resulting list is sorted. It appends `1` to a list `b` if the processed list is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it fails.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Numbers Greater Than 10:**
   - The code only checks if the current number is greater than 10 and splits it into digits based on some conditions, but it does not properly handle the digits and their insertion back into the list.
   - Specifically, the code does not ensure that the digits are inserted in the correct positions and does not account for the possibility of multiple digits being inserted.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic:**
   - The code attempts to compare digits and the original number in a way that does not guarantee the array will be sorted after the operation.
   - For example, the code checks if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y <= x` but does not handle all cases correctly, especially when multiple digits are involved.

3. **Lack of Iterative Splitting:**
   - The code does not iteratively split numbers greater than 10 until the entire array is potentially sorted.
   - This means that if a number like 123 is encountered, it might not be fully split into 1, 2, 3, and the array might remain unsorted.

### Counter Example:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
123 5 10
```
- The code will first encounter 123, which is greater than 10.
- It will split 123 into 1 and 23 (incorrectly, it should split into 1, 2, 3).
- It will then compare and insert these digits into the list.
- The resulting list might not be sorted, and the code will incorrectly determine that sorting is not possible.

### Correctness Verification:
Given the above issues, the code does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
