Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; if `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then `n` is 2 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is 1; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing `a[i]`. Otherwise, `n` is 1; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.**
