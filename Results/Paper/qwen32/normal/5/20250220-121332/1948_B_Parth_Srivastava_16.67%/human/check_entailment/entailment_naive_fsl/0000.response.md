Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it fails.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Numbers Greater Than 10:**
   - The code only checks if the current number is greater than 10 and splits it into digits based on some conditions, but it does not properly handle the digits and their insertion back into the list.
   - Specifically, the code does not ensure that the digits are inserted in the correct positions and does not account for the possibility of multiple digits being inserted.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic:**
   - The code attempts to compare digits and the original number in a way that does not guarantee the array will be sorted after the operation.
   - For example, the code checks if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y <= x` but does not handle all cases correctly, especially when multiple digits are involved.

3. **Lack of Iterative Splitting:**
   - The code does not iteratively split numbers greater than 10 until the entire array is potentially sorted.
   - This means that if a number like 123 is encountered, it might not be fully split into 1, 2, 3, and the array might remain unsorted.

### Counter Example:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
123 5 10
```
- The code will first encounter 123, which is greater than 10.
- It will split 123 into 1 and 23 (incorrectly, it should split into 1, 2, 3).
- It will then compare and insert these digits into the list.
- The resulting list might not be sorted, and the code will incorrectly determine that sorting is not possible.

### Correctness Verification:
Given the above issues, the code does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
