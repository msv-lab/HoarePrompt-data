The code snippet `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `i`) are not directly modified by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

The output state is that `c` now includes the value of `y` at the end of the list, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` includes `y` at the end of the list.**
