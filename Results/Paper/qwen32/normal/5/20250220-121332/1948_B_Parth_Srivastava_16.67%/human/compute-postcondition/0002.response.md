The provided code snippet converts the string `a` into a list of integers by splitting the string and mapping each split component to an integer.

Given the initial state, `a` is a string and after the code execution, `a` is transformed into a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of integers (the input value split and converted from a string), and `k` is an input integer.**
