The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `c`. This means that the list `c` will now include the element `a[i]` at the end of it. The values of `t`, `a`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` includes `a[i]` at the end.**
