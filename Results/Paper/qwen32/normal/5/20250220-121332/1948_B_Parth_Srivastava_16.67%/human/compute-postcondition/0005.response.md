Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers (the input value split and converted from a string), and `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been changed to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
