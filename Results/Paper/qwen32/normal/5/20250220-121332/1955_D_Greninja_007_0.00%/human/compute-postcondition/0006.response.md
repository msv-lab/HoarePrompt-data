Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= m < n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5`, `good_subarrays` is 1, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the sublist `a[:m]`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum of the frequencies of each element `x` that appears in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`, and `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Natural language: The value of `good_subarrays` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
