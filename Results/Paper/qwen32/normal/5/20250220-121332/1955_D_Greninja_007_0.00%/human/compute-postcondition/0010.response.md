Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= m < n`, `n` and `m` are integers such that `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5`, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the sublist `a[:m]`. If `a[i]` is an element that exists in `b_freq`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum of the frequencies of each element `x` that appears in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` minus `min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is set to 1; otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains 0. If `a[i]` does not exist in `b_freq`, `matches` and `good_subarrays` remain unchanged.**
