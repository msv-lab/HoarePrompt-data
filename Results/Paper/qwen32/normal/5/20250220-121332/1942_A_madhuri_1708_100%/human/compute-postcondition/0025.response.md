To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. Let's break down the loop and its behavior:

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over each line of input starting from the second line (the first line is the number of test cases `t`).
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to 2:
     - If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints a sequence of `k` numbers, each being `k`.
     - If `n` is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`.
   - If `k` is less than 2, it prints a sequence of `n` numbers, starting from `1` to `n`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state is determined by the results of all test cases processed by the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are used to control and determine the output for each test case, but after the loop finishes, their values do not affect the output directly.

**Output State**: The output state after all iterations is the concatenation of the outputs for each test case. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact test cases, we can't provide a specific sequence of numbers, but we can describe the final state in terms of the processed test cases.

Output State: **The output is a sequence of lines, each corresponding to the result of processing one test case as described above.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the output will be a series of lines, each line being either a sequence of numbers or `-1`, based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
