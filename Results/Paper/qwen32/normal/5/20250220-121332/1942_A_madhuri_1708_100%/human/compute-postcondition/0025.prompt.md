Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k >= 2:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            print('-1')
    else:
        print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, no change is made to `n` or `k` unless `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k` is less than 2, no change is made to `n` or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting `s` and converting the parts to integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting the new `s` and converting the parts to integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, the program executes the if part of the nested if statement. Otherwise, the program executes the else part of the nested if statement. In all cases, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after their derivation from `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
