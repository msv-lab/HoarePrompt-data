Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a sequence of numbers based on the conditions: if `k` is 1, it prints numbers from 1 to `n`; if `k` is greater than 1 and equal to `n`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times; otherwise, it prints `-1`.**
