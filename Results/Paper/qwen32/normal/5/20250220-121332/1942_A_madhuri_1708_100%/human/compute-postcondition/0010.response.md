Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, no change is made to `n` or `k` unless `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k` is less than 2, no change is made to `n` or `k`.**
