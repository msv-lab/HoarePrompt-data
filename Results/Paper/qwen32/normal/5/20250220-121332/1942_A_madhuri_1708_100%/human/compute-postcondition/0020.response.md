Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `s` is the next line from the input file.
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting the new `s` and converting the parts to integers.
- The value of `k` determines whether the program executes the if part or the else part, but in this case, we only have the print statement which does not depend on the if-else condition.
- The print statement is `print(*[k for j in range(k)])`.

### Analysis:
1. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` generates a list where the value `k` is repeated `k` times. For example, if `k` is 3, the list comprehension will produce `[3, 3, 3]`.

2. **Unpacking Operator (`*`)**: The unpacking operator `*` in the `print` function call unpacks the list, meaning each element of the list is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function. This results in the elements being printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `k` repeated `k` times, each separated by a space.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be `k` printed `k` times, separated by spaces.

Output: **k k k ... k (where k is repeated k times)**

To make it more precise in the required format:
Output: **k (repeated k times, separated by spaces)**
