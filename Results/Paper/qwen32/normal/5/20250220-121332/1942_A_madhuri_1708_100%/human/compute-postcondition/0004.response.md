Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from a split string `s`.
- Specifically, `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`.
- The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

Let's break down the code snippet:

1. `[k for j in range(k)]` is a list comprehension that generates a list containing the value `k`, repeated `k` times.
   - Since `k` is the second integer from the split string `s` and `n` (the first integer) is equal to `k`, the list comprehension will generate a list of `k` elements, all of which are `k`.

2. `print(*[k for j in range(k)])` uses the unpacking operator `*` to print the elements of the list, separated by spaces.

Given that `n = k`, and `k` is an integer from the split string `s`, the output will be a sequence of `k` values, each being `k`.

For example, if the split string `s` results in `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the list comprehension will generate `[3, 3, 3]`, and the print statement will output:
```
3 3 3
```

If the split string `s` results in `n = 5` and `k = 5`, the list comprehension will generate `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, and the print statement will output:
```
5 5 5 5 5
```

Thus, the output will be `k` repeated `k` times, where `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`.

Output: **k k k ... k (where k is repeated k times, and k is the second integer from the split string `s`)**
