The only object in the loop head is the variable `s`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each line in the input file (excluding the first line). Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the next line from the input file.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`. Since `n` and `k` are derived from the current value of `s`, they do not need to be adjusted directly. Instead, we need to adjust `s` to the next line in the input file.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `s` is the next line from the input file, `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`**. 

However, since `n` and `k` are derived from `s`, the most accurate state representation at the start of the next iteration is just the new value of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `s` is the next line from the input file**.
