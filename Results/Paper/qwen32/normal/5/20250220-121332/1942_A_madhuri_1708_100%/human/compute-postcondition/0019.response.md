The code snippet provided splits the string `s` into two parts and converts these parts into integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state already specifies that `n` and `k` are derived from splitting `s` and converting the parts to integers, the execution of the code does not change the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting the new `s` and converting the parts to integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after their derivation from `s`.**
