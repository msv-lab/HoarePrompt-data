Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting `s` and converting the parts to integers.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The value of `s` remains unchanged as well. The line `s` is split into parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `k`.
