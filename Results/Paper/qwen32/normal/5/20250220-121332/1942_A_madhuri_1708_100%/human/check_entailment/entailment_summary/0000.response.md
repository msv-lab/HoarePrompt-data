### Reasoning:

The given problem requires constructing an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. The provided solution handles the following cases:

1. **When `k == 1`:** The solution outputs an array that is strictly increasing, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`. This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
2. **When `k == n`:** The solution outputs an array where all elements are the same, e.g., `[k, k, k, ..., k]`. This ensures that all `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.
3. **When `1 < k < n`:** The solution outputs `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to construct an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

Let's analyze the correctness of the solution:

- **Case `k == 1`:** The output `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` is correct because only the original array is sorted, and all other cyclic shifts are not sorted. This meets the requirement.
  
- **Case `k == n`:** The output `[k, k, k, ..., k]` is correct because all cyclic shifts are identical and sorted. This also meets the requirement.
  
- **Case `1 < k < n`:** The output `-1` is correct because constructing an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts is not possible under these conditions. The only way to have multiple sorted cyclic shifts is to have all elements the same (which results in `k == n`), or to have only one sorted cyclic shift (which results in `k == 1`).

The solution correctly handles all possible valid values of `k` and provides an appropriate output for each case. Thus, the solution is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
