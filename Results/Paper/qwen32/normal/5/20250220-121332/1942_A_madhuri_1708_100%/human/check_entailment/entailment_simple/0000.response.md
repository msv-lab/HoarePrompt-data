Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by analyzing the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Let's break down the logic:

1. If `k >= 2`, the program checks if `n == k`. If true, it outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`. This is because if all elements are the same, all cyclic shifts of the array will be sorted, which matches the requirement of having `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` equals `n`. If `n != k`, the program outputs `-1` because it's not possible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k >= 2` and `n != k`.

2. If `k < 2`, the program outputs an array where elements are in increasing order from 1 to `n`. This is because only the first cyclic shift (the array itself) will be sorted, which matches the requirement of having exactly one sorted cyclic shift when `k == 1`.

The logic covers two main cases:
- When `k >= 2`, it only provides a solution if `k == n` (all elements the same).
- When `k == 1`, it provides a solution where the array is strictly increasing.

However, there is a missing case: when `k == 2` and `n > 2`. In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `-1`, but there can be valid arrays that satisfy the condition. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 1]` has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`. The current program does not handle such cases correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible valid inputs correctly.

Correctness: **False**
