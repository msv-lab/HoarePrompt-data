Precondition: **a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. b is a list of strings representing the field, where each string is a row of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, and M is the number of columns in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The list b has N elements. The next input is an integer T representing the number of steps in the game, where 0 <= T <= 10000. Following T lines are the actions performed by entities in the field, where each action is a string containing a pair of characters followed by a space and a valid action (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and possibly additional information for catch and throw actions.**
