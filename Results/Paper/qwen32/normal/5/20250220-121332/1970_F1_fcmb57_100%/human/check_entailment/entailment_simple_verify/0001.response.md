### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ball Catching and Throwing:**
   - The program does not handle the `C` (catch) and `T` (throw) actions correctly. It checks if a player is in a goal when throwing the Quaffle, but it does not track whether the player is carrying the Quaffle. This is a significant issue because the program should ensure that only a player carrying the Quaffle can throw it.

2. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The program checks if a player is in a goal when throwing the Quaffle but does not verify whether the goal belongs to the opposing team. It should check if the player is in the opponent's goal before awarding a point. Currently, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the program incorrectly awards a point to the same team.

3. **Lack of Quaffle Movement:**
   - After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field. The program does not update the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

4. **Missing Movement Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to move players, but it is not defined in the provided code. This function is essential for updating the positions of players based on their movements. However, the function definition is actually present in the code, so this point is not accurate.

5. **Incorrect Goal Position Handling:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the position of goals. It uses a list to store goal positions but does not check which team's goal is which when determining if a point should be awarded. This issue is related to the incorrect goal scoring logic mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as it does not handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle correctly, does not correctly determine which team scores a point, and does not update the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
