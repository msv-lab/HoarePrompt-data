Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a string input from the user), `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated in order. The first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, the last string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, and the first string in `a` is not the same as the last string in `a`.**
