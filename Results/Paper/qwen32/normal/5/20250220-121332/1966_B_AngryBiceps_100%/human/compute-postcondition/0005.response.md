The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `i` and the range is determined by `n`. Therefore, the state of `n` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The values of `t`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` do not affect the execution of the loop directly as per the loop head.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string**
