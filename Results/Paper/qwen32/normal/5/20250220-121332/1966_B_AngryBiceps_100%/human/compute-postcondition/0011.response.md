The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. 

Given the initial state, `first_row` is the first character of the original input string, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of the newly appended input string. Therefore, `first_row` will now be the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the newly appended string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input string and the newly appended input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original first character of the input string and the first character of the newly appended input string, `last_row` is the last character of the original input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
