The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Given that `a` is a list containing one element (the input string), `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that input string.

Thus, `last_row` will now contain this last character. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `first_row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list containing one element (the input string); `first_row` is the first character of the input string; `last_row` is the last character of the input string.**
