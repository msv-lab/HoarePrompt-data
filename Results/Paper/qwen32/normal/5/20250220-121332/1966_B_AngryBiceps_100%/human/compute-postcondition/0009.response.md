The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that the loop has just finished executing for that value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is an integer read from the input
- `a` is a list containing one element (the input string)
- `first_row` is the first character of the input string
- `last_row` is the last character of the input string

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1
- `n` remains the same

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing one element (the input string), `first_row` is the first character of the input string, `last_row` is the last character of the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**
