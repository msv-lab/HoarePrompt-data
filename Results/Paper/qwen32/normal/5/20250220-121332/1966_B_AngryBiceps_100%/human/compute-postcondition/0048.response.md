Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a string input from the user), `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated in order, and either the first string in `a` does not consist of a single character, or the last string in `a` does not consist of a single character, or the first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`. Additionally, `first_row` consists of identical characters, `last_row` consists of identical characters, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.**
