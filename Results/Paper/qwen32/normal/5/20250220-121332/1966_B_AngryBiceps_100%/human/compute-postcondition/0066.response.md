The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the second string in the list `a` to `last_row`. 

Given that `last_row` is initially the last character of the first string in `a`, after the execution of the code, `last_row` will be the concatenation of the last character of the first string and the last character of the second string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the original string input from the user and the second being a new string input from the user; `first_row` is the first character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second string in `a`.**
