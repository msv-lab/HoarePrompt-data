To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `ans` based on the given initial state. 

The initial state specifies that `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. However, the specific values of `x` and `k` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe `ans` in terms of `x` and `k`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables**: 
   - `x`: An integer for which we are finding divisors.
   - `k`: An integer that serves as the upper limit for the divisors of `x`.
   - `ans`: The largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Determine the Value of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the largest number that divides `x` without leaving a remainder and is also less than or equal to `k`.

Since the specific values of `x` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the information given.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
