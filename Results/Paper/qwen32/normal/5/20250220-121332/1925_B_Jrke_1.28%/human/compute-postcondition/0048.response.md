The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Therefore, the list `l` now contains two elements: the initial value `1` and the new value `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` divides `x` evenly, `l` is a list containing the values [1, i], and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
