Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1, and `l` is a list containing the elements `[1, i]`. The condition (x // i <= k) is true.**
