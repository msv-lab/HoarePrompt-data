Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. If `k` is 1, then the current value of `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is not 1.**
