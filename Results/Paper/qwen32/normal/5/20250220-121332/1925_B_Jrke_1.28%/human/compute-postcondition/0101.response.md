The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Before the code is executed, `l` contains a single element, which is the maximum value `ans`. After the execution, `l` will contain two elements: the original `ans` and the value of `i` (which is 7).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 36, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `i` is 7, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and 7.**
