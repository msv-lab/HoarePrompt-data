The code provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and during each iteration, `x` and `n` are provided with values such that `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, and `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x.**
