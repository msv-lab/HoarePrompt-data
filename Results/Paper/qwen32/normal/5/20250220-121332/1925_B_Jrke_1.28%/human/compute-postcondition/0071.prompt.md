Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i == 0`, then `i` divides `x` evenly. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the values [1, i, x // i]. Otherwise, `l` remains [1, i]. If `x % i != 0`, `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` contains the value `ans` and the new value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 2 and is still less than `int(x)`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` now contains the value `x // i`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration and is still less than `int(x)`. If `x % i == 0`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the values of `ans`, `i`, and the new value `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` contains the value of `ans` and the new value `x // i`. The value of `ans` has been updated to the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i != 0`, no changes are made to `l` or `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
