Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is 1, `ans` remains 1. If no such factor exists, `ans` remains 1.**

Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the if part's postcondition, with the additional clarification that if `k` is 1, `ans` remains 1.
