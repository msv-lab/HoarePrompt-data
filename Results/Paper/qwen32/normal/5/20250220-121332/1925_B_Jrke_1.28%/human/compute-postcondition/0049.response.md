Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` divides `x` evenly, and `l` is a list containing the value 1 if `i` is greater than `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the values [1, i].**
