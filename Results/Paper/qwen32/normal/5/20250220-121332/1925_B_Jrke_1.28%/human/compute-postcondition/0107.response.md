To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve. The loop iterates over odd numbers starting from 3 (or 4 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x`. For each iteration, it checks if `x` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, it updates the list `l` with `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` (if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`), and then updates `ans` to the maximum value in `l`.

Given the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. After the first iteration, `x` must be at least 4.
2. After the second iteration, `x` must be at least 4, and the loop must have checked `i = 5`.
3. After the third iteration, `x` must be at least 36, and the loop must have checked `i = 7`.

The loop continues until `i` exceeds the square root of `x`. The final value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Let's analyze the loop with these points in mind:

- The loop starts at 3 (or 4 if `x` is even) and increments by 2, so it checks odd numbers.
- For each `i`, if `x % i == 0`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k` and updates `ans` accordingly.
- The loop stops when `i` exceeds the square root of `x`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `x = 36` and `n = 5` for simplicity:
- `k = 36 // 5 = 7`
- The loop checks `i = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...` but stops at `i = 7` because `sqrt(36) = 6`.

For `i = 3`: `36 % 3 == 0`, `l = [1, 3, 12]`, `ans = 3` (since 12 > k).
For `i = 5`: `36 % 5 != 0`, `l` remains `[1, 3]`, `ans = 3`.
For `i = 7`: `36 % 7 != 0`, `l` remains `[1, 3]`, `ans = 3`.

In this example, the final `ans` is 3.

### General Case:
The final `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Output State:
Output State: **ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k.**

In natural language, the final output state is: The value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is `x // n`. The other variables `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
