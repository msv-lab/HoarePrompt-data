The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of `t`, `ul`, or `ur`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

Since the loop head does not contain any variables that directly influence the state of `t`, `ul`, or `ur`, we only need to consider the loop control variable `_` and the number of remaining iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs adjustment is the loop control variable `_`, which will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. However, since `_` is not used within the loop body, its value does not affect the values of `t`, `ul`, or `ur`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `t`, `ul`, and `ur`. The only change is that the loop will execute one more time if the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is not yet reached.

State: **`t`, `ul`, and `ur` are variables. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ur` is updated to its initial value plus `2 * k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` or `ur`.**
