To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the given conditions step by step.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1` (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. If true, it prints `a[i], a[i]` and increments `ur` by 2. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop breaks.

### Output State After Each Iteration:
1. **After 1st Iteration**:
   - If `r[a[n] - 1] == 2`, `ur` is incremented by 2.
   - Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.
   - The loop continues unless `ul == ur`.

2. **After 2nd Iteration**:
   - If `r[a[n+1] - 1] == 2`, `ur` is incremented by 2.
   - Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.
   - The loop continues unless `ul == ur`.

3. **After 3rd Iteration**:
   - If `r[a[n+2] - 1] == 2`, `ur` is incremented by 2.
   - Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.
   - The loop continues unless `ul == ur`.

### Generalization:
- The loop runs `n` times.
- For each iteration, `ur` can be incremented by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
- The loop breaks if `ul == ur` at any iteration.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will run `n` times unless `ul == ur` at any point during these iterations.
- `ur` will be incremented by 2 for every iteration where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
- The final value of `ur` will depend on how many times `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` is true during the `n` iterations.
- `ul` remains unchanged unless the loop breaks due to `ul == ur`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be determined by the number of times `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` is true during the `n` iterations. If `ul` never equals `ur`, the loop will complete all `n` iterations.

### Output State:
If `ul` never equals `ur` during the loop, `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. Let's denote the number of such iterations by `k`.

Thus, the final state of `ur` will be `initial_ur + 2 * k`, where `k` is the count of iterations where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.

**Output State: **t, ul, and ur where ur is initial_ur + 2 * k.**

In natural language: The final state is that `t` and `ul` remain unchanged, while `ur` is increased by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop breaks, and `ur` will be at the value it reached at that point.
