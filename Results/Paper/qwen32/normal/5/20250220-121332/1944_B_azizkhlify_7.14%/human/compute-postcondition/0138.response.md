To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

- `t` is a variable (its value is not specified).
- `ul` is either `k * 2 + 2` or `k * 2`, but its exact value is not relevant for this print statement.
- `ur` is 0.
- `n` is 2.
- `k` is the second input integer (its value is not specified).
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`.
- `r` is [0, 1].
- `re` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is given as 2. Therefore, the print statement will output the element at index 2 of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values to be printed. However, we know that `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`, the third element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
