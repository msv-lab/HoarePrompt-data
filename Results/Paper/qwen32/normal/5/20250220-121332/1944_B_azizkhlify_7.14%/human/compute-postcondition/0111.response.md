The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a variable, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
