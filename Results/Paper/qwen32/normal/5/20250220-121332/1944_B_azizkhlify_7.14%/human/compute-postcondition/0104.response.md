The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a variable, `ul` is a variable, `ur` is a variable, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
