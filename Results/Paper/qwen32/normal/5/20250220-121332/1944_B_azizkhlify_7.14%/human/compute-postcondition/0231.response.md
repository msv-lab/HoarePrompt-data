The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `l[a[i] - 1]`, `ul`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2; `ul` is increased by 2; `ul` equals `k * 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
