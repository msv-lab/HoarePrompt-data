Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from the input line to integers; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is 2; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 1`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` has been incremented by 1. Since `l` initially had a 1 at this index (as per the initial state), it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
