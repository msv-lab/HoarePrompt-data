To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables and Their Initial Values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
   - `n` is an integer such that n >= 1.
   - `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul`, but `k` is also not zero. This seems to be a recursive or self-referential definition, which needs clarification. We will assume that `k` is initially set to some value and then recalculated based on `ul`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `res` is a list containing `a[1]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, otherwise `res` is empty.
   - `re` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, otherwise `re` is 1.
   - `i` is initially set to 2.

2. **Behavior of the Program:**
   - The variable `i` starts at 2. The print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
   - The value of `a[i]` depends on the contents of the list `a`.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The exact values of `a`, `l`, `ul`, `k`, `res`, and `re` are not provided, so we can't determine their exact values.
   - The print statement will output the element at index `i` of the list `a`.

4. **Output Description:**
   - Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index `i`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially set to 2, the element printed will be `a[2]`.

Output: **a[2]**
