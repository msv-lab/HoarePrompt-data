To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Key Information from the Initial State

1. **`a`** is a list of integers from the input.
2. **`l`** is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a`.
3. **`l[a[i] - 1]`** is 1, which means the integer `a[i]` appears exactly once in the list `a`.

### Analysis

- The statement `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 tells us that the integer `a[i]` appears exactly once in the list `a`.
- Since `l` is a list of counts for integers 1 and 2, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `a[i]` must be either 1 or 2, and it appears exactly once in `a`.

### Conclusion

Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `a[i]` is either 1 or 2, and it appears exactly once in the list `a`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only say that `a[i]` is either 1 or 2, but it is guaranteed to be one of these values.

### Output

Output: **1 or 2 (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and a[i] appears exactly once in the list a)**
