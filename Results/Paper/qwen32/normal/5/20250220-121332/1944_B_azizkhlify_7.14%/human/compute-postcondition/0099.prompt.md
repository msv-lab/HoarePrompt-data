Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t, ul and ur are defined. The current value of ul is not equal to the current value of ur.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `ul`, and `ur` are defined with `ul` not equal to `ur` unless the if condition is true, in which case `ul` equals `ur` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. `n` is at least 1. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is defined, `ul` is defined, `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, otherwise `ur` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is defined, `ul` is defined, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 2`, and `ur` is unchanged. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
