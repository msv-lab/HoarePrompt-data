Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine the impact on the variables after executing the line `r[a[i] - 1] += 1`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is an integer such that n >= 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from the input line to integers.
- `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is `n + 2`.

### Code Execution:
The line `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` modifies the list `r`. Specifically, the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is incremented by 1.

### Impact on Variables:
- The variable `i` is `n + 2`, which is out of bounds for the list `a` since `a` has `n` elements (indices ranging from 0 to `n-1`). This means `a[i]` is accessing an index that does not exist in the list `a`.
- Since `a[i]` is out of bounds, the code would typically raise an `IndexError` in Python. However, for the purpose of this task, we will assume that the code is executed in an environment where this error is handled, and we focus on the intended effect of the code as described.

### Output State:
Given the assumptions and the provided code, the only variable that would be affected is `r` if the code were to execute without error. However, since `i` is `n + 2` and `a` has only `n` elements, `r` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from the input line to integers; `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `n + 2`.**
