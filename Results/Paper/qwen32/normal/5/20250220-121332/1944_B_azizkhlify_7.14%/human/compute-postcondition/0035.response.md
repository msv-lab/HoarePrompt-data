Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4 if the i-th element of `a` satisfies `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is incremented by 1. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
