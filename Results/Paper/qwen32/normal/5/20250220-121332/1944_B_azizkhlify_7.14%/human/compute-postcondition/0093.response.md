The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is defined, `ul` is defined, `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, otherwise `ur` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is `n + 2`. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
