The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from the input line to integers.**
