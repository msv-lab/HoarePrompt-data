The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `l[a[i] - 1]`, or `ul`. It only terminates the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
