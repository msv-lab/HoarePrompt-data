To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. This variable does not affect the immediate print statement.
2. `n` is an integer such that n >= 1. This variable also does not affect the immediate print statement.
3. `k` is defined by the equation `k = 2 * k - ul`, but it is not relevant to the immediate print statement.
4. `a` is a list of integers. This is the list we need to focus on.
5. `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`. This list is used to count occurrences of elements in `a`.
6. `r` is a list of `n` integers. This list is not relevant to the immediate print statement.
7. `re` is initialized to 0. This variable is not relevant to the immediate print statement.
8. `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations. This variable is not relevant to the immediate print statement.
9. `ur` is initialized to 0. This variable is not relevant to the immediate print statement.
10. `res` is an empty list. This list is not relevant to the immediate print statement.
11. `i` is initialized to 0. This is the index we will use to access elements in `a`.

The key piece of information here is that `i` is 0, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. This means that the first element of `a` (which is `a[0]`) appears exactly once in the list `a`.

Let's denote the first element of `a` as `a[0]`. Since `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1, it confirms that `a[0]` appears exactly once in `a`.

Therefore, the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a`)**
