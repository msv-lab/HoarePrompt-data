Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `2*n - 1`; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is now the number of times `a[i]` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `r` will have the counts of each unique element from the sublist `a[n:2*n]`. The other variables remain the same as per their initial state.

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; if `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ul` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the value of `ul` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and if `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
