Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that n >= 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing all elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1. If `k` is not zero, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1 up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index at which `re` reached `k`. If `k` is zero, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**
