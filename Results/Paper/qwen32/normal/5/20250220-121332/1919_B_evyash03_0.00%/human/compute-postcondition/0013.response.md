Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. If `balance` is less than 0, then `count` is 1 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value (either 1 if the last character was '+', or -1 if the last character was '-').**
