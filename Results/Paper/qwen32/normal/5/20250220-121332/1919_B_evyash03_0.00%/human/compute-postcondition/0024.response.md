Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string, `balance` is decreased by 1.**

In simple terms, the `balance` variable has been decreased by 1, while the `expression`, `length`, and `char` variables remain unchanged.
