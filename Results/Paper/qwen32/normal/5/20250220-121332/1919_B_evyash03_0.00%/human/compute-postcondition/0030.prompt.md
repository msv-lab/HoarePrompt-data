Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`; `count` is 0; `balance` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for char in expression:
    if char == '+':
        balance += 1
    elif char == '-':
        balance -= 1
    if balance < 0:
        count += 1
        balance = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. If `balance` is less than 0, then `count` is 1 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value (either 1 if the last character was '+', or -1 if the last character was '-').

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string. If `balance` was less than 0, `count` is incremented by 1 and `balance` is set to 0. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged and `balance` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string. If `char` is '+', `balance` is increased by 1. If `char` is '-', `balance` is decreased by 1. If `balance` was less than 0, `count` is increased by 1 and `balance` is reset to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
