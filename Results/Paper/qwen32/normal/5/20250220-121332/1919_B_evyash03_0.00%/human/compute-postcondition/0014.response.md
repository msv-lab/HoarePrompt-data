The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression` string. If there are more characters in the `expression` string, the loop will execute again, with `char` taking on the next character in the string.

At the end of the last iteration, `expression` is a string with `length` characters, and `char` is the last character processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in the `expression` string.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in the `expression` string. The states of `length`, `balance`, and `count` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. If `balance` is less than 0, then `count` is 1 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value (either 1 if the last character was '+', or -1 if the last character was '-'). `char` is the next character in the `expression` string.**
