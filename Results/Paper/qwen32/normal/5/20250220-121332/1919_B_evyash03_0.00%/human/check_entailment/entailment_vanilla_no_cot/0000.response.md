Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of segments where the balance of '+' and '-' characters goes negative and then resets the balance, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty. The provided solution does not implement such an approach and hence is incorrect.
