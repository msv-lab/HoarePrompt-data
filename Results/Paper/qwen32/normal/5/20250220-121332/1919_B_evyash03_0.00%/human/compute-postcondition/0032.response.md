Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `expression`, which is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and a parameter `length`, which is an integer representing the length of the string. The function calculates the number of times the balance goes negative as it processes each character in the string. If the final net balance is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the count of times the balance went negative before returning the result. Otherwise, it returns just the number of times the balance went negative.**
