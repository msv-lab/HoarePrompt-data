Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string. If `char` is '+', `balance` is increased by 1. If `char` is '-', `balance` is decreased by 1. If `balance` was less than 0, `count` is increased by 1 and `balance` is reset to 0.**
