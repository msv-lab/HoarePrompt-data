In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `expression`. For the loop to execute, the string `expression` must contain at least one character since the loop iterates over each character in `expression`. 

Given the provided state before the loop starts, the only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `expression`. The variables `count` and `balance` are initialized and do not affect whether the loop can execute. The variable `length` is dependent on the length of `expression`, so adjusting `expression` will automatically adjust `length`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will execute if `expression` has at least one character.
2. `count` and `balance` are initialized to 0 and do not affect the execution of the loop.
3. `length` is dependent on `expression` and will be adjusted automatically if `expression` is modified.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `expression` must be a string with at least one character.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `count` is 0, `balance` is 0**
