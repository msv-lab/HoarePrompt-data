### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations provided, considering the problem description and the intended solution strategy.

#### Problem Recap

The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of each subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

#### Key Observations

1. **Subarrays with Zero Sum**: If a subarray has a sum of zero, its penalty is zero. Therefore, it's optimal to include such subarrays in the partition.
2. **Subarrays with Non-Zero Sum**: For subarrays with a non-zero sum, the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the subarray. To minimize the total penalty, we should try to keep these subarrays as short as possible.

#### Strategy

- Traverse the array while maintaining a balance counter that increases with `+` and decreases with `-`.
- Whenever the balance becomes negative, it means that the subarray from the last reset point to the current point has a non-zero sum. We should reset the balance and count this subarray.
- At the end of the traversal, if the balance is positive, it indicates that there is an unprocessed subarray with a positive sum.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program is as follows:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    parts = expression.split('-')
    result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
    print(func_1(expression, result_length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
    return count + (balance > 0)
```

#### Annotations and Observations

1. **Splitting by `-`**: The line `parts = expression.split('-')` and `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))` calculates the length of subarrays that do not contain `-`. However, this calculation is not used in the function `func_1` and does not contribute to the correct penalty calculation.
2. **`func_1` Function**: This function maintains a balance counter and increments the count whenever the balance goes negative. It also adds one if the final balance is positive. This logic essentially counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if there is a remaining positive balance, which corresponds to the number of subarrays with non-zero sums.

#### Correctness of the Program

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of subarrays with non-zero sums, which is indeed the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty. Each subarray with a non-zero sum contributes to the penalty, and the number of such subarrays is minimized by the described approach.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the function only counts the number of subarrays with a negative balance and adds one if the final balance is positive, implying it does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. However, this is actually the intended and correct approach to solving the problem.

### Conclusion

The provided program is correct as it correctly implements the strategy to minimize the penalty by counting the number of subarrays with non-zero sums.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
