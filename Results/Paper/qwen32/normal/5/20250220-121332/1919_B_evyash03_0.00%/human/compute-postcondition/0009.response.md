Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `count` is 0, and `balance` is 1 if `char` is '+', `balance` is -1 if `char` is '-', and `balance` remains 0 if `char` is neither '+' nor '-' (though `char` is guaranteed to be either '+' or '-').**
