To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.

The game can be analyzed based on the total number of coins (a + b). The key insight is whether the total number of coins is even or odd. Here is the reasoning:

- If the total number of coins (a + b) is **even**, Alice and Bob will alternate turns, and since Alice makes the first move, Bob will make the last move. This means Bob will be the one who cannot make a move when all coins are taken, so Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is **odd**, Alice will make the last move, as she starts the game and they alternate turns. This means Alice will be the one who cannot make a move when all coins are taken, so Alice wins.

The given program correctly implements this logic by checking if (a + b) is even or odd and printing "Bob" for even and "Alice" for odd.

Given the examples in the problem statement, the program produces the correct output:

- For (1, 1), total is 2 (even), so it prints "Bob".
- For (1, 4), total is 5 (odd), so it prints "Alice".
- For (5, 3), total is 8 (even), so it prints "Bob".
- For (4, 5), total is 9 (odd), so it prints "Alice".
- For (11, 9), total is 20 (even), so it prints "Bob".
- For (83, 91), total is 174 (even), so it prints "Bob".
- For (1032, 9307), total is 10339 (odd), so it prints "Alice".
- For (839204, 7281), total is 846485 (odd), so it prints "Alice".
- For (1000000000, 1000000000), total is 2000000000 (even), so it prints "Bob".
- For (53110, 2024), total is 55134 (even), so it prints "Bob".

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
