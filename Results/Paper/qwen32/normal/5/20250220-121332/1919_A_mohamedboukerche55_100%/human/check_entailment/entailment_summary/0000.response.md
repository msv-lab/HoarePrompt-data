Reasoning: 
The game described is a strategic game where the outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins, and if it is odd, Alice wins. This is because:

- When the total number of coins is even, Alice and Bob will always have an even number of turns before one of them runs out of coins. Since Bob makes the last move when the total number of coins is even, he will be the one who cannot make a move after all coins are taken, thus losing the game. Therefore, Bob wins when the total number of coins is even.
- Conversely, when the total number of coins is odd, Alice will make the last move, and Bob will be the one who cannot make a move after all coins are taken, thus losing the game. Therefore, Alice wins when the total number of coins is odd.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and printing "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
