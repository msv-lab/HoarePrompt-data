The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i` (the value after the previous iteration), and `t` is greater than `i + 1`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `t` remains the same as it is the upper limit for the loop.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `i + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.

State: **`s` is the new input string; `a` is the integer value of the first element in the new input string `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second element in the new input string `s`; `t` is greater than `i + 1`; the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
