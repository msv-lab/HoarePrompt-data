Reasoning:  
The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program simply checks if the length of the array `c` is equal to 2 and then prints a fixed output for that case. For any other length of the array, it prints a fixed output of `13 0`. This is not a general solution to the problem.

The problem requires finding the maximum sum of the array after performing the MEX operation on subarrays. The given program does not perform any operations on the array and does not compute the correct maximum sum for different inputs. It only handles one specific case (when the length of the array is 2) and provides incorrect results for all other cases.

For example:
- For the input `2\n0 1`, the program correctly outputs `4 1\n1 2`, but this is hardcoded and not a result of any computation.
- For the input `3\n1 3 9`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `13 0` only if the initial sum of the array is already the maximum possible sum, which is not generally the case.
- For the input `4\n1 100 2 1`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`.
- For the input `1\n0`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1 1\n1 1`.

Since the program does not correctly handle the problem for general cases, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
