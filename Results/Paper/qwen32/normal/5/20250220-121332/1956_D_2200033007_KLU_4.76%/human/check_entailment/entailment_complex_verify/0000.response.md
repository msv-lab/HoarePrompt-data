### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated version in detail to confirm this:

1. **Program Overview:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `n`.
   - The function `func_1` checks if the length of the array `n` is 2. If true, it prints `4 1` followed by `1 2`. Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` only handles the case when `n` is 2 by printing `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - For any other value of `n`, it prints `13 0`.
   - The function does not perform any operations on the array to maximize the sum or compute the MEX of any subarray.

3. **Evaluation Against Problem Statement:**
   - The problem statement requires the program to perform operations on the array to maximize the sum by computing the MEX of subarrays and updating the array elements accordingly.
   - The provided program does not perform any such operations. It only handles two hardcoded cases and prints fixed results.
   - The hardcoded results are only correct for specific inputs:
     - For `n = 2` and input `0 1`, the output `4 1` and `1 2` is correct.
     - For any other input, the output `13 0` is incorrect. For instance, for the input `4 1 100 2 1`, the correct output should be `105 2 3 3 3 4` as per the problem description.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program fails to implement the required logic for maximizing the sum of the array for all possible inputs.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the program as incorrect due to its inability to handle general cases and perform the necessary operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
