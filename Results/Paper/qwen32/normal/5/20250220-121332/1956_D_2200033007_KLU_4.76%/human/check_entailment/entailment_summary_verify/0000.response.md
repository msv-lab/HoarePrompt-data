### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of an array of integers by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) of that subarray.
   - The function should handle arrays of length between 1 and 18, and each element should be between 0 and 10,000,000.
   - The function should output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input array and calls `func_1` with the length of the array.
   - `func_1` only handles two cases:
     - If the length of the array is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
     - For any other length, it prints `13 0`.
   - The program does not perform any operations on the array to compute the MEX or maximize the sum.
   - The program is hardcoded to handle only two specific cases and does not generalize to other inputs.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary correctly describes the function's behavior as only handling specific cases and printing hardcoded results.

4. **Examples**:
   - For the input `4 1 100 2 1`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `105 2 3 3 3 4`.
   - For the input `2 0 1`, the program outputs `4 1 1 2`, which is correct.
   - For the input `3 1 3 9`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is correct.
   - For the input `1 0`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1 1 1 1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The program is incorrect for any input other than the specific cases it is hardcoded to handle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
