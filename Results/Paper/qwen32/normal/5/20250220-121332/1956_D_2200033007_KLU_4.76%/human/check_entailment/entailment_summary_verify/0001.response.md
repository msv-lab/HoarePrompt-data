Reasoning: 

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program does not perform any operations on the array based on the MEX value and simply prints hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array. This approach does not consider the actual values in the array and the operations that can be performed to maximize the sum of the array.

Let's analyze the program based on the function summary and the problem description:

1. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as input, which is the length of the array. Based on whether `c` is 2 or not, it prints specific hardcoded outputs and returns `None`.

2. **Program Behavior**:
    - If the length of the array (`c`) is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This is correct for the specific test case `[0, 1]` because setting both elements to `2` (the MEX of `{0, 1}`) results in a sum of `4`.
    - For any other length of the array, it prints `13 0`. This is incorrect for several reasons:
        - For the test case `[1, 3, 9]`, the initial sum is `13`, and no operations are needed. However, the program does not handle this correctly because it assumes that the sum will always be `13` for arrays of length not equal to 2, which is not true for all cases.
        - For arrays of length greater than 2, the program should analyze the array and perform operations to maximize the sum based on the MEX value, which it does not do.

3. **Examples**:
    - **First Example**: `[0, 1]` -> Correct output `4 1` and `1 2`.
    - **Second Example**: `[1, 3, 9]` -> Incorrect output `13 0`. The program does not perform any operations, even though no operations are needed to achieve the sum of `13`.
    - **Third Example**: `[1, 100, 2, 1]` -> Incorrect output `105 2` and operations `3 3` and `3 4`. The program does not perform the correct operations to achieve the sum of `105`.
    - **Fourth Example**: `[0]` -> Incorrect output `1 1` and `1 1`. The program should output `1 0` because no operations are needed to achieve the sum of `1`.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it. The program's hardcoded outputs are not a general solution to the problem.

Final: **False**
