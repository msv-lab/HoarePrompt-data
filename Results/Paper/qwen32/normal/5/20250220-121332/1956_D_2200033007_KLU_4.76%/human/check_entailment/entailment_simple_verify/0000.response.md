### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Handling of Input:**
   - The program reads the input and converts it into a list of strings `a`. However, it should convert these strings into integers for proper computation.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the length of the array `c` (which should be an integer, not the array itself) and performs hardcoded outputs based on whether `c` is equal to 2.
   - For `c == 2`, it outputs `4 1` followed by `1 2`.
   - For any other value of `c`, it outputs `13 0`.
   - This hardcoded behavior does not reflect the problem's requirement to compute the MEX of subarrays and perform operations to maximize the sum.

3. **MEX Calculation and Operations:**
   - The program does not perform any operations on the array to maximize its sum. It does not calculate the MEX of any subarray nor does it update the array based on the MEX value.
   - The program does not handle any input other than the specific cases it is hardcoded to handle, which is incorrect for the general problem.

4. **Examples:**
   - For the input `4 1 100 2 1`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `105 2 3 3 3 4` based on the problem description.
   - The program does not provide any mechanism to compute the correct MEX values and perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
