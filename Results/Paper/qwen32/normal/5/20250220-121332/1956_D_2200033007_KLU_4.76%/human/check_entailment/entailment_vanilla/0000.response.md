Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program does not perform any operations on the array based on the MEX value and simply prints hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array. This approach does not consider the actual values in the array and the operations that can be performed to maximize the sum of the array.

For example:
- In the first test case, the array is `[0, 1]`. The program outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which is correct because after setting both elements to `2` (the MEX of `{0, 1}`), the sum becomes `4`.
- However, for the second test case, the array is `[1, 3, 9]`. The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The initial sum of the array is already `13`, and no operations are needed to achieve this sum. However, if we apply the operation on the entire array, we can set all elements to `0` (the MEX of `{1, 3, 9}`), which is not optimal. The correct approach would be to identify segments of the array that can be increased by applying the MEX operation.

The program does not implement the logic required to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
