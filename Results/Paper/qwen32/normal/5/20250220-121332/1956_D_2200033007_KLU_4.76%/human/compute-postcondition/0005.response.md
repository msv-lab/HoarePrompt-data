The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a formatted string. The format of the string is `f'13 0'`, which is a literal string with no variable interpolation involved. The variables `c` and `m` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state describes `c` as a list of integers with certain constraints, and `m` as 0.
2. The `print` statement is `print(f'13 0')`, which directly prints the string `'13 0'`.

Since there are no variables or expressions within the curly braces `{}` in the formatted string, the values of `c` and `m` do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the literal string `'13 0'`.

Output: **13 0**
