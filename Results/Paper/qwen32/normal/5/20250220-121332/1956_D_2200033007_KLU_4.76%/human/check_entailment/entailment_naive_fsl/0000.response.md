Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and prints hardcoded results. It does not perform any operations on the array to maximize the sum as described in the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
which is incorrect. According to the problem description and the provided examples, the correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

Additionally, the program does not handle any input other than the specific cases it is hardcoded to handle. It does not compute the MEX of any subarray and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect for any input other than the two specific cases it is hardcoded to handle.
