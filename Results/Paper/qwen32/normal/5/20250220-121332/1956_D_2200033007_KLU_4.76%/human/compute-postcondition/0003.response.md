The given Python code snippet is a print statement that outputs a formatted string. The format string `'1 2'` is static and does not depend on any variables or conditions provided in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state describes `c` as a list of integers with specific constraints, and `m` as an integer with a value of 0.
- However, these variables (`c` and `m`) are not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'1 2')
```
This statement will output the string `'1 2'` as it is, without any modifications or substitutions.

Output: **1 2**
