Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves maximizing Alice's profit in a game where she and Bob interact over a set of items. Each item has two prices: one for Alice (`a_i`) and one for Bob (`b_i`). Alice buys items and then Bob can either take them all for free if Alice bought less than `k` items or take `k` items for free and pay for the rest. Alice's profit is the difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends.

### Optimal Strategy

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should aim to buy items such that the difference `b_i - a_i` is maximized, as this will maximize her profit when Bob pays her for the items he buys.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob will take `k` items for free that minimize Alice's profit. This means he will choose items with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values.

### Correctness of the Provided Program

Let's examine the provided functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads an integer from the input.
   - It uses a custom function `putin()` which is not defined in the provided code. Assuming `putin()` correctly reads input from `sys.stdin`, this function is correct.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads a line of integers from the input.
   - Similar to `func_1`, it uses `putin()` which is assumed to be correctly implemented.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function calculates Alice's profit.
   - It takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `sub_summ` is initialized to 0.
   - The first loop sums up the first element of each tuple in `sec_arr`.
   - The second loop checks if the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` is non-negative and adds it to `sub_summ`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Undefined `putin()` Function**: The function `putin()` is not defined in the provided code, which will result in a `NameError` when the program is run.
2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_3`**:
   - The logic in `func_3` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
   - The program should sort the items based on the difference `b_i - a_i` to maximize Alice's profit.
   - Bob's strategy of taking `k` items for free should be considered by selecting the `k` items with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values from the items Alice buys.

### Correctness

Given the issues outlined, the provided program is not correct. The logic in `func_3` does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob, and the undefined `putin()` function will cause a runtime error.

**Correctness: False**
