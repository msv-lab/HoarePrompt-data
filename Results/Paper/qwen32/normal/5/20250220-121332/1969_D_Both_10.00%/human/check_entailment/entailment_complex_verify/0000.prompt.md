You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 1 4
    
    3 3 2 3
    
    4 2
    
    2 1 1 1
    
    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

    return int(putin())
    #The program returns the integer value of whatever `putin()` returns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value that the function `putin()` returns.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the variables in the function signature alone.
def func_2():

    #The program returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element of the list obtained by splitting the string input from `putin()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string input from `putin()`, splits the string into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar and sec_arr are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. Each tuple in main_ar and sec_arr represents the prices (a_i, b_i) of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively.

    #State: main_ar
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns `sub_summ`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob. It calculates a sum, `sub_summ`, by adding the first element of each tuple in `sec_arr` and the sum of both elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the tuple's elements is non-negative. The function returns this calculated sum.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program consists of three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) that are not used in a coherent manner to solve the problem. There is no main function or any logic that ties these functions together to process the input and produce the correct output.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_3`**: The function `func_3` is supposed to calculate Alice's profit, but it does not consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically:
   - It simply sums up the `b_i` values without considering which items Bob will take for free.
   - It adds the difference `a_i + b_i` for items where `a_i + b_i >= 0`, which is not aligned with the objective of maximizing Alice's profit.

3. **Handling of Input**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are supposed to read input, but they rely on a function `putin()` which is not defined in the provided code. This makes the code incomplete and non-functional.

4. **Optimization Strategy**: The problem requires Alice to choose items in such a way that her profit is maximized, and Bob to minimize this profit by taking `k` items for free. The provided code does not implement any strategy to achieve this.

To correct the program, you would need to:
- Implement a strategy for Alice to choose items that maximize her profit.
- Implement a strategy for Bob to choose `k` items to take for free, minimizing Alice's profit.
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to handle the input efficiently, given the constraints.
