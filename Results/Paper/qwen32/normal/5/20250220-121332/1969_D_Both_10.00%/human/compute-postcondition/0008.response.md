The only variable in the loop head is `val_b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `main_ar` list. If `main_ar` has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. The state of `sec_arr`, `sub_summ`, and the elements of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

For the loop to execute, `main_ar` must contain at least one tuple. The state of `val_b` before the loop starts is not relevant because it gets assigned the first element of `main_ar` during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`**
