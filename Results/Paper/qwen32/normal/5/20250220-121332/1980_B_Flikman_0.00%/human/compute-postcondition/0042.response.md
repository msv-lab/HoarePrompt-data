Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the new list `a`; `same_value_count` is 0; `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`.**

In this output state, the variable `same_value_count` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
