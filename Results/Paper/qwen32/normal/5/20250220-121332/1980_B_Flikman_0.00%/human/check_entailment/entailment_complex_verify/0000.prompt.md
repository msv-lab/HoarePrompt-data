You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: t is 0; n, f, k, a, favorite_value, same_value_count, and greater_count reflect the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines whether the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the `f`-th element (1-based index) plus the number of elements equal to the `f`-th element is sufficient to meet or exceed `k`. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met, 'NO' if it is not, and 'MAYBE' if the number of greater elements is less than `k` but the sum of greater and equal elements is more than `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases. Here is a breakdown of how the program works and verifies the correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Favorite Cube Value**: The value of Dmitry's favorite cube is stored in `favorite_value` by accessing the element at index `f-1` of the list `a`.

3. **Counting Same and Greater Values**:
   - `same_value_count` counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube.
   - `greater_count` counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If `greater_count` (cubes with values greater than the favorite cube) is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the favorite cube will definitely be removed because there are at least `k` cubes with larger values.
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it means even if all cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube are removed, the favorite cube will still not be removed.
   - Otherwise, the result is "MAYBE", indicating that the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on the exact order of cubes with the same value.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left. The logic covers all edge cases, such as when all cubes have the same value, when the favorite cube has the maximum value, and when the favorite cube has the minimum value.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
