The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the count of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. If `x` is not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it will be added with an initial count of 1, and then immediately incremented to 2. Since the code does not affect `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, or `num_list`, these variables remain unchanged. The only change is in the `num_of_lens` dictionary where the count of `x` is updated.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1.**
