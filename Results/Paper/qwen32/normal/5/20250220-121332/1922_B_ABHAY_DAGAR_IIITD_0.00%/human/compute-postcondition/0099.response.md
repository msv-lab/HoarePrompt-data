The code snippet provided is `num_of_lens[x] = 1`. This line of code assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. 

Given the initial state, `x` is the next element in `num_list`, and `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers. The variable `num_of_lens` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it can be inferred that it is a dictionary used to store the count of some property related to the elements in `num_list`.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `test_cases` remains the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` remains the list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` remains the input integer, `num_list` remains the list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers, `x` remains the next element in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens[x]` is now 1.
