The code snippet provided appends the value of `res` to the `results` list. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `num_list` and values as their respective counts, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 items from counts `cnt >= 3` and all combinations of 2 items from counts `cnt >= 2` multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` at that point, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
