The code snippet modifies the variable `res` by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, the new value of `res` will be the previous value of `res` plus this computed value.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is unchanged from the previous iteration, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
