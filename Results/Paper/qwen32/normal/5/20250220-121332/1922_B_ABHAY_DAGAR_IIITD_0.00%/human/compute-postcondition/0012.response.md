The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the count of the current element `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, and `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the previously processed element. After executing the code, the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` will be increased by 1.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the previously processed element.**
