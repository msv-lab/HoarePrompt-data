Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added as a key to `num_of_lens` with the value `1`.**
