The code snippet sets `total_count` to 0. This does not affect any other variables directly. Therefore, the only change is that `total_count` is reset to 0.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count.**
