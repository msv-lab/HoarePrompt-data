Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and value 1, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` which is now 1.**

In simpler terms, the `num_of_lens` dictionary now includes `x` with a value of 1, and `total_count` is updated to 1 because `num_of_lens` now has one key-value pair. All other variables remain unchanged.
