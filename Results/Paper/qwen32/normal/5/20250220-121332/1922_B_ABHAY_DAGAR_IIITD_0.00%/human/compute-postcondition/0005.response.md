The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which is iterated over `num_list`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `num_list` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_of_lens`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution and thus cannot be adjusted to make the loop run.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary**
