To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for x in num_list:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `x`, and it iterates over `num_list`. Therefore, the state of `num_list` is the only one we need to adjust to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `num_list` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
