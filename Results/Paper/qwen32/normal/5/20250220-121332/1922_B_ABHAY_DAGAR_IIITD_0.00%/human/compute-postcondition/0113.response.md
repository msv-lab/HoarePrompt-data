The code snippet `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` modifies the value of `res`. The initial value of `res` depends on the value of `cnt`:
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is initially `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
- Otherwise, `res` is initially 0.

After executing the code, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its initial value. Since `total_count` is 0, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` evaluates to 0. Therefore, the value of `res` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is 0, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is unchanged.**
