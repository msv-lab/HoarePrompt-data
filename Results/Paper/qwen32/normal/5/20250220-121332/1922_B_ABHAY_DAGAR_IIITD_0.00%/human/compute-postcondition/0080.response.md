The code snippet provided increments the `res` variable by the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. This value is added to `res` only if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `cnt`, so we will consider the general case where `cnt` can be any integer.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `cnt_next`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples; `results` is a list containing `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `results` remains `res`; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair); `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`; `cnt` is `cnt_next`; `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
