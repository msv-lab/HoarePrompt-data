The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over `num_list`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration and how it will change in the next iteration.

Given:
- `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer.
- `x` is the current element being processed in `num_list`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` has taken on the value of the last processed element in `num_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `num_list` to process. Therefore, `x` should now be the next element in `num_list` after the previously processed one.

Let's denote the previous value of `x` as `x_prev`. The next value of `x` will be the next element in `num_list` after `x_prev`. Since we do not have the specific values of `num_list` or the current index of `x` in `num_list`, we can only describe the state in a general manner.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the previously processed element.**

Since we do not have the specific value of `x` or the index, we can't specify the exact next value of `x`, but we know it will be the next element in `num_list` for the loop to continue. If we assume the loop has just started and `x` was the first element, then in the next iteration, `x` will be the second element, and so on.

For a more precise state, if we assume `x` was the first element in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `x` will be the second element in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. `x` is the second element in `num_list`.**

If `x` was the second element in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `x` will be the third element in `num_list`, and so on. But since we need a general state, we'll stick with the first transition.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the previously processed element.**
