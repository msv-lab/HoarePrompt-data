The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `res`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least one `res` value, `n` is the last input integer, `num_list` is the last list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is the dictionary from the last iteration with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` from the last iteration, `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations**
