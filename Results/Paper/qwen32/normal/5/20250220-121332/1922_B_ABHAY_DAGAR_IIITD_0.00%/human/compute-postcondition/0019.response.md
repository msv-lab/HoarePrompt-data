To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it processes each element in `num_list`.

The loop iterates over each integer `x` in `num_list` and updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary accordingly. If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with the value `1`.

Given that the output states after the first 3 iterations describe the loop's behavior and that `num_list` must have at least 3 integers for 3 iterations to occur, we can generalize this to the entire list `num_list`.

After all iterations are complete, `num_of_lens` will contain a count of each unique integer in `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Let's summarize the final state:

- `test_cases`: Remains the length of the list of tuples (unchanged).
- `results`: Remains an empty list (unchanged).
- `n`: Remains the input integer (unchanged).
- `num_list`: Remains the list of integers obtained from the input (unchanged).
- `num_of_lens`: A dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and the corresponding value is the count of that integer in `num_list`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `num_list` and values as their respective counts.**
