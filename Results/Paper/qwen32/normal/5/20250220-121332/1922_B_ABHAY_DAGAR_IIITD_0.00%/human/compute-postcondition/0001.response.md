In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. This means that the loop will execute based on the length of `test_cases`, which is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases. The variable `_` is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` should be an integer greater than or equal to 1. However, the description provided states that `test_cases` is a list of tuples, not an integer. Therefore, to align with the loop head, `test_cases` should be adjusted to be the length of the list of tuples.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `len(test_cases)` times, where `test_cases` is expected to be an integer.
2. The current state says `test_cases` is a list of tuples, so we need to adjust it to be the length of that list.
3. The variable `results` is an empty list and does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list**
