The code snippet provided is `num_of_lens = {}`. This line reassigns `num_of_lens` to be an empty dictionary, discarding its previous value, which was a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language: The variable `num_of_lens` has been reset to an empty dictionary. All other variables retain their previous values.
