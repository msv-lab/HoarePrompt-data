The code snippet provided updates the `num_list` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and then storing these integers in a list. This means that the `num_list` will now contain the new integers provided by the input.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count`) are not directly affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In simple terms, `num_list` has been updated to contain the integers from the new input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
