Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 items from counts `cnt >= 3` and all combinations of 2 items from counts `cnt >= 2` multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` at that point, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count. If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, the current value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added as a key to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**
