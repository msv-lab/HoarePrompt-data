Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
