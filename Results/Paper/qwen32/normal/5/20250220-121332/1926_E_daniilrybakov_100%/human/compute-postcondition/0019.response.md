The code snippet `m *= 2` multiplies the variable `m` by 2. Initially, `m` is 2. After the operation, `m` becomes 4. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `2 * x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
