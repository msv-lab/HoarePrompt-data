The value of `x` is recalculated using the new value of `n` as `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq \text{original } n\); `s` is `original n + 1`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
