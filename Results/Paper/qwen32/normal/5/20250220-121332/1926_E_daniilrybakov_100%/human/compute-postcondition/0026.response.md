The value of `m` is multiplied by 2. The initial value of `m` is 4, so after the operation, `m` becomes 8. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n // 2` (where `n` is the original value of `n`), `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `3 * x`, `m` is 8, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
