The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is `n // 2`
- `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `s` is `2 * x`
- `m` is 4
- `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

Since `n` is updated to `n // 2` in each iteration, if `n` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration will set `n` to 0, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `2 * x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
