The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `s` is the sum of `(original n + 1) // 2` from each iteration, and `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\).

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (not used in the loop body), it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is 0, `s` is the sum of `(original n + 1) // 2` from each iteration, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `t` is `t - 1`**
