Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is now `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq \text{original } n\); `s` is `(original n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(original n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
