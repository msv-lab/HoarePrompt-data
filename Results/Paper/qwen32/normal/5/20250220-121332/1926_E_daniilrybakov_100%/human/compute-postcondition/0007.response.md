The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which is integer division of `n` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
