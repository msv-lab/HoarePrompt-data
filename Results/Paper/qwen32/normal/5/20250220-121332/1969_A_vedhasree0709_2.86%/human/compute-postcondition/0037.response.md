Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
