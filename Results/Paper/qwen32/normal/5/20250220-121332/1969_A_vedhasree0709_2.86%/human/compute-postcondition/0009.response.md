Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a list of integers where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`; `i` is 0; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
