The `print(2)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, or `j`. The value to be printed is explicitly provided in the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(2)` statement is a direct instruction to output the integer `2`.
2. The value of `2` is known and does not change based on the initial state or any conditions described.
3. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, or `j` affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print(2)` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
