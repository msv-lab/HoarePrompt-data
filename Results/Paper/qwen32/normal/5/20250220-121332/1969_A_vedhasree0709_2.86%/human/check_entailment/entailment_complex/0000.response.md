### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by checking for a specific pattern in the list `p` for each test case. However, the logic used in the program is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed such that at least two friends come to the party. The friends will come to the party if both they and their best friends receive invitations. The program only checks if there are two consecutive elements in the list `p` that match the pattern `(i+2, i+1)`. If such a pair is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.

However, the problem can be solved more effectively by considering the following points:

1. **Pairs of Friends**: Each friend `i` has a best friend `p[i]`. To ensure that at least two friends come to the party, we need to find pairs `(i, p[i])` and invite both members of at least one such pair.

2. **Minimum Invitations**: The minimum number of invitations needed is 2 if there is at least one pair `(i, p[i])`. If no such pair exists (which is rare given the constraints), we would need to invite more friends, but the problem guarantees that there are at least 2 friends and all `p_i` are distinct and not equal to `i`.

The program provided does not correctly identify all possible pairs `(i, p[i])` and does not handle all cases. It only checks for a specific pattern `(i+2, i+1)` which is not a general solution to the problem.
