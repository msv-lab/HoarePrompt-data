The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is an input integer. The output state will include the updated list `l` along with the unchanged values of `t` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.**
