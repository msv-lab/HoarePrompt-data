The `break` statement in the code will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. However, since no loop or if statement is provided in the context, the `break` statement does not affect any of the variables directly. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
