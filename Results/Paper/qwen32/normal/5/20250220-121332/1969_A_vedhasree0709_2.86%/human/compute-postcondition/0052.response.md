To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates and the values of the variables at that point.

### Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i <= n - 1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, then:
     - `print(2)`
     - `j` is set to 1.
     - The loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output States After Iterations**:
   - **After 1 iteration**:
     - `i` becomes 1.
     - If `l[0] == 2` and `l[1] == 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the loop breaks.
   - **After 2 iterations**:
     - `i` becomes 2.
     - If `l[1] == 3` and `l[2] == 2`, then `j` is set to 1 and the loop breaks.
   - **After 3 iterations**:
     - `i` becomes 3.
     - If `l[2] == 4` and `l[3] == 3`, then `j` is set to 1 and the loop breaks.

### Final Output State

The loop will continue until `i` exceeds `n - 1` or the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met, setting `j` to 1 and breaking the loop.

- If the condition is met at any point, `j` will be 1, and `i` will be the value at which the condition was met.
- If the condition is never met, the loop will run until `i` equals `n`, at which point `j` will remain 0.

### Conclusion

The final output state is determined by whether the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met at any point during the loop execution.

- If the condition is met at some `i`, then:
  - `j` will be 1.
  - `i` will be the value at which the condition was met.
- If the condition is never met, then:
  - `j` will be 0.
  - `i` will be `n`.

Given the above logic, the final state can be described as:

**Output State:** `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `n` if the condition was never met, otherwise `i` is the value at which the condition was met; `j` is 1 if the condition was met, otherwise `j` is 0.

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `l` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` will be `n` if the specific condition (`l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`) was never met during the loop iterations.
- The value of `j` will be 1 if the specific condition was met at any point, otherwise it will remain 0.
