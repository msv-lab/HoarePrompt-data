Output State: **`t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been set to 1, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
