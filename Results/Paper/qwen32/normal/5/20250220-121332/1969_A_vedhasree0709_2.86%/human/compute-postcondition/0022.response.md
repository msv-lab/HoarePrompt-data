Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 3; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is 2. If `l[2]` equals 4 and `l[3]` equals 3, then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` retains its original value and no loop or if statement is broken.**
