The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is already an input integer, but this line of code will overwrite the previous value of `n` with the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is the new input integer; `j` is 0 indicating that the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met for any `i`.**
