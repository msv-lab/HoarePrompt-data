In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is provided by the user input. 

The variables `n`, `p`, and the contents of `p` are related to the test cases themselves and are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we only need to ensure that the input `t` is such that the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5000`, no modification is needed for `t` to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is within the specified range.

So, the only state we need to consider is `t` and it is already correctly defined in the problem statement.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
