The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1 if `l[0]` is 2 and `l[1]` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.
