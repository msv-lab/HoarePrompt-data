The given code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, and `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, with `M` being 1000000007. The code modifies the variable `c` by assigning it the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.**
