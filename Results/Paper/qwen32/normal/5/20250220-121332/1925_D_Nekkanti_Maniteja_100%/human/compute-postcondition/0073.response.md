Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of elements and `m` is the number of pairs. It also receives an integer `k`. For each of the `m` lines, it receives integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing pairs and an associated value. The function returns a value or result based on the provided inputs for each test case.**
