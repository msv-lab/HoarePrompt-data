Let's break down the given code snippet and determine its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0
- `M` is 1000000007
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`
- `s` is 0
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations
- `i` is `k + m`

The code modifies `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `s` was initially 0, the new value of `s` will be:
```python
s = c * i * c * m + c * a
```

This can be simplified to:
```python
s = c * c * i * m + c * a
```
or
```python
s = c**2 * i * m + c * a
```

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c**2 * i * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `i` is `k + m`**
