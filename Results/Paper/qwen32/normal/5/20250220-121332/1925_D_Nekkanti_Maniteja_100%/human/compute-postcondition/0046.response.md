To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the given output states.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0
- `M` is 1000000007
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`
- `s` is 0
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations
- `i` is `k + m`

From the provided output states:
1. After 1 iteration: `s` is `c`
2. After 2 iterations: `s` is `c + c^2 * 1 * m + c * a`
3. After 3 iterations: `s` is `c + c^2 * 1 * m + c * a + c^2 * 2 * m + c * a`

We can generalize the pattern:
- For each iteration `j` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `k-1`), the value added to `s` is `c * j * c * m + c * a`.

Thus, the expression for `s` after `k` iterations can be written as:
\[ s = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (c * j * c * m + c * a) \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ s = c * \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (j * c * m + a) \]
\[ s = c * \left( c * m * \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} j + \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} a \right) \]

The summation of the first `k-1` integers is given by:
\[ \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} j = \frac{(k-1) * k}{2} \]

And the summation of `a` for `k` terms is:
\[ \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} a = k * a \]

So the expression for `s` becomes:
\[ s = c * \left( c * m * \frac{(k-1) * k}{2} + k * a \right) \]
\[ s = c * \left( \frac{c * m * k * (k-1)}{2} + k * a \right) \]

Since we are working modulo `M`, we need to ensure that all operations respect the modulus. Therefore, the final expression for `s` after `k` iterations is:
\[ s = c * \left( \frac{c * m * k * (k-1) \% M + k * a \% M}{2} \% M \right) \% M \]

The final values of the variables are:
- `t` remains unchanged
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged
- `M` remains unchanged
- `c` remains unchanged
- `s` is updated as per the derived formula
- `a` remains unchanged
- `i` remains `k + m` as it is not modified in the loop

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * ((c * m * k * (k-1) // 2) % M + k * a % M) % M`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `i` is `k + m`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `s` after all iterations is computed using the derived formula, while all other variables remain unchanged.
