The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `f`, `i` is `k + 2`, `m` must be greater than 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**
