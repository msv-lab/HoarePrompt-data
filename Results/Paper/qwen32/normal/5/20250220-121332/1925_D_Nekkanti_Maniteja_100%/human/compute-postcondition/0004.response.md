The code snippet initializes the variable `s` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is 0.**
