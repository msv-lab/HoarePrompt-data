The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state already includes values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a`, but these are not modified by the provided code snippet.

The only variables that change are `u`, `v`, and `f`, which are assigned the values read from the input. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `k` is greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `2 * f`, `i` is `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input.**
