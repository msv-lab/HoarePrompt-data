The given code snippet only redefines `M` to be `10 ** 9 + 7`. However, the initial state already defines `M` as `1000000007`, which is equivalent to `10 ** 9 + 7`. Therefore, the reassignment does not change the value of `M`.

Since no other variables are affected by this code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the redundancy in the definition of `M`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * ((c * m * k * (k-1) // 2) % M + k * a % M) % M`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `i` is `k + m + 1`.**
