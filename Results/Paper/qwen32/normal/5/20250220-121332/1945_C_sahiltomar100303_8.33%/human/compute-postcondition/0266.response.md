The code snippet `rightZero = 0` sets the value of the variable `rightZero` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 5, `rightOne` is 1, `right` is 10, `t` is t - 1, `s` is an input string.**
