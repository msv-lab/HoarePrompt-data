Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `leftZero` is increased by 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 2, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1 again, making it two increments more than its initial state. All other variables retain their original conditions and values.
