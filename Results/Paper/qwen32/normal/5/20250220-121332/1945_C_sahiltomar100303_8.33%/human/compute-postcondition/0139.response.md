Output State: **`s` is an input string; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`; `right` is `final_right`; `n` is an input integer; if `left` is 0, the conditions specified in the if part hold, and if `right` is equal to `n`, `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`; if `left` is not 0, the conditions specified in the else part hold, and if `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0.**

In simpler terms, `tleftZero` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
