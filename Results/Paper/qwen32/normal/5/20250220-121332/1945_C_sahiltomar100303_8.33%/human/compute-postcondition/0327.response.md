Output State: **`left` is 1, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `trightZero` is `zero_count`, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -2, `rightZero` is `zero_count`, `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`, `rightOne` is 0**

The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1, so it changes from -1 to -2. All other variables retain their initial values.
