The code snippet provided sets the variable `leftZero` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 5, `rightOne` is 1, `right` is 10, `t` is t - 1, `s` is an input string.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `leftZero` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
