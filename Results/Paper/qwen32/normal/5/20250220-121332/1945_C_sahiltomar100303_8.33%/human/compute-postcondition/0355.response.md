The code snippet provided decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state:
- `left` is 0
- `mid` is 1
- `n` is 2
- `right` is 1
- `t` is `t - (2 - 1)` (which simplifies to `t - 1`)
- `s` is a string
- `leftMove` is 0
- `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 (so if it was initially x, now it is x + 1)

After executing the code `trightOne -= 1`, the value of `trightOne` will be decreased by 1.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 1, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is a string, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, `trightOne` is decreased by 1**.
