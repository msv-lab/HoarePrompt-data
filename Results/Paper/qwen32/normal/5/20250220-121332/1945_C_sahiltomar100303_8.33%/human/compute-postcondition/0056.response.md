The code snippet provided initializes `leftMove` to 0. None of the other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `left` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0.**
