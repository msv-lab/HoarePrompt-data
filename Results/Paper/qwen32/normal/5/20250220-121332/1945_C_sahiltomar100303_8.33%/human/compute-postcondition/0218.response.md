Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 4, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is less than 3, `right` is 5, and `s[right]` is not '0'; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is less than 2.**

Natural language: The value of `trightOne` has been decremented by 1, so if it was less than 3 before, it is now less than 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
