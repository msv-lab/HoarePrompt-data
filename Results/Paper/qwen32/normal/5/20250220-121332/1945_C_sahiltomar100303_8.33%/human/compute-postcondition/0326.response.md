To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left > 0`
2. `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `left > 0`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is 0. This means the condition `left > 0` is currently false. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `left` to a value greater than 0. Let's set `left` to 1.

2. **Condition `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`**:
   - With `left` set to 1, let's evaluate the sub-conditions:
     - `leftZero < (1 + 1) // 2` simplifies to `leftZero < 1`.
     - `rightOne < (2 - 1 + 1) // 2` simplifies to `rightOne < 1`.

   - We need at least one of these sub-conditions to be true for the loop to execute.

   - From the given state, `rightOne` is `one_count`. To ensure `rightOne < 1`, we need to set `one_count` to 0.

   - Alternatively, we can ensure `leftZero < 1`. Given the state, `leftZero` is either -1 or 0. Since -1 already satisfies `leftZero < 1`, we can keep `leftZero` as -1.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `left` to 1 and `one_count` to 0. No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.
