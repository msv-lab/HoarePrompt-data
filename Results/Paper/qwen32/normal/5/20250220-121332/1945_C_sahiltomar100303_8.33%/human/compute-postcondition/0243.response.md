Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `left` is 0
- `mid` is 5
- `n` is 10
- `leftZero` is 0
- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftOne` is 5
- `rightOne` is 1
- `right` is 10
- Additionally, `rightOne` is less than (n + 1) // 2

### Additional Information:
- The condition `rightOne < (n + 1) // 2` translates to `1 < (10 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `1 < 5.5`, and since `1` is indeed less than `5.5`, this condition is satisfied.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(right)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `right` is explicitly given as 10 in the initial state.
- There are no operations or conditions that modify the value of `right` before the `print` statement is executed.

### Conclusion:
The `print(right)` statement will output the value of `right` which is 10.

### Final Output:
Output: **10**
