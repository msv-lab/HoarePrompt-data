Output State: **`left` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` is `n`, `leftZero` is `count_zero`, `rightZero` is `zero_count`, `leftOne` is `count_one`, `rightOne` is `one_count`, `right` is `10`, `t` is `t - (n - mid)`, `s` is `s`, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `trightZero` is `zero_count`, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is `one_count`.**

Natural Language: The value of `left` is now set to `n // 2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
