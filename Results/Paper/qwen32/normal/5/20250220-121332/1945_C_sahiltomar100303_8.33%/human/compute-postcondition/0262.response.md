The code snippet `n = int(input())` will update the value of `n` based on the input provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 5, `n` is an input integer, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 5, `rightOne` is 1, and `right` is 10, `t` is t - 1**.
