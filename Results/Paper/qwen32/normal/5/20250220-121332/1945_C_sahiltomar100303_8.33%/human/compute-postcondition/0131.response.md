The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not hold any state that needs to be adjusted based on the provided conditions. The loop simply runs `t` times, and the state of `_` does not affect the conditions or variables mentioned in the problem statement.

Given that, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the implicit increment of the loop counter `_`.

State: **`tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`, `right` is `final_right`, and other variables remain unchanged. If `left` is 0, the conditions specified in the if part hold, and if `right` is equal to `n`, `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0, the conditions specified in the else part hold, and if `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**
