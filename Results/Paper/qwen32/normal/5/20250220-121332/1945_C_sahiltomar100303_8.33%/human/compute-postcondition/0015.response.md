Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current character at `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `leftZero` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
