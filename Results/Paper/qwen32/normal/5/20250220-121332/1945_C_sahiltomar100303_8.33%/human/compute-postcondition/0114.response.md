Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`, `right` is `final_right`, and `right` is equal to `n`. If `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, and the conditions specified in the else part hold. Other variables remain unchanged.**
