The code snippet assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. Therefore, `right` is now equal to `n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the right half, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the right half, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the first half, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the first half, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `right` is `n // 2`.**
