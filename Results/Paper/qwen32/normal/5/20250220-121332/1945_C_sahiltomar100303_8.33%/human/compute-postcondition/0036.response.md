Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 1, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is `mid`, and `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
