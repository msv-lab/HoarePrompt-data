Postcondition: **`tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`, `right` is `final_right`, `left` is not 0, and other variables remain unchanged. If `right` equals `n`, then `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `right` is not equal to `n`, and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**
