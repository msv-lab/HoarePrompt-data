Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * 0`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2]`. This implies that `b[i]` is 0, and `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged because subtracting 2 times 0 from it has no effect.
- `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 7.
- The output is 'YES' (though this seems to be a statement and not a variable assignment).
- `i` is 5.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The statement `print('NO')` will simply print the string 'NO'.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
