The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` sets the value of `b[i]` to 0, as subtracting a value from itself results in zero. The other elements of the list `b` and the integer `a` remain unchanged. The output remains 'YES'.

Output State: **`b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]` (which simplifies to `b[i + 1]` since `b[i]` is 0), `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]` (which simplifies to `b[i + 2]` since `b[i]` is 0); `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; the output is 'YES'.**
