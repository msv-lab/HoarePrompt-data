Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
