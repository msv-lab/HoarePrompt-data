The code snippet `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` modifies the element at index `i + 2` of the list `b` by subtracting the value of the element at index `i`. Given that `i` is 1, this operation modifies `b[3]` by subtracting `b[1]` from it.

Let's break it down step by step:
- `i` is 1.
- `b[i + 2]` is `b[3]`.
- `b[i]` is `b[1]`.

The operation `b[3] -= b[1]` means `b[3] = b[3] - b[1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is greater than 3.
- `b[0]` is 0.
- `b[1]` has been updated to `b[1] - 2 * b[0]` which simplifies to `b[1]` since `b[0]` is 0.
- `b[2]` has been updated to `b[2] - b[0] - 2 * (b[1] - 2 * b[0])` which simplifies to `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`.
- `b[3]` has been updated to `b[3] - 2 * (b[1] - 2 * b[0])` which simplifies to `b[3] - 2 * b[1]`.

After the operation `b[3] -= b[1]`, the new value of `b[3]` will be `b[3] - 2 * b[1] - b[1]` which simplifies to `b[3] - 3 * b[1]`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 3, `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - 3 * b[1]`, and `i` is 1.**
