The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `a`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `a`**: It is greater than 2. Again, `a` is not used in the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `i`**: It is defined as `i + 2`. This operation modifies the value of `i`, but `i` is not used in the `print` statement.

Since none of the described variables (`t`, `a`, `i`) are referenced in the `print` statement, the output will simply be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
