Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be transformed into all zeros using a specific operation: choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)), and then performing:
- \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
- \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
- \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, reads the number of elements \( n \) in the array.
   - Reads the array \( b \) of \( n \) integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Iterates over the array from index 0 to \( n-3 \).
   - For each index \( i \):
     - Checks if \( b[i] \) is negative (unnecessary due to problem constraints).
     - Modifies the array by subtracting \( 2 \times b[i] \) from \( b[i+1] \) and \( b[i] \) from \( b[i+2] \), and sets \( b[i] \) to 0.
   - After the loop, checks if the last two elements \( b[-1] \) and \( b[-2] \) are zero. If they are, prints "YES"; otherwise, prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - The program incorrectly modifies the array elements. Instead of reducing the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, it incorrectly reduces \( b[i+1] \) by \( 2 \times b[i] \) and \( b[i+2] \) by \( b[i] \). This does not reflect the correct operation described in the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Feasibility:**
   - The program only checks if the last two elements are zero after processing the array. This is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the described operation.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
- We need to simulate the operation while ensuring that all elements remain non-negative.
- After processing, all elements should be zero.

### Revised Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def can_make_all_zeros():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] > 0:
                x = min(a[i] // 2, a[i-1], a[i+1])
                a[i-1] -= x
                a[i] -= 2 * x
                a[i+1] -= x
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

can_make_all_zeros()
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
