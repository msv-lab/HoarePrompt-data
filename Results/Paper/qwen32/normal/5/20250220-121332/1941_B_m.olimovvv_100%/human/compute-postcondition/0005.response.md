The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The condition that the current element `b[i]` is less than 0 is also mentioned, but it does not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or their values, the output will simply be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
