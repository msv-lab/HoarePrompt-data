Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * 0`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2]`
- `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 6
- The output is 'YES'
- `i` is 4
- If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Code snippet:
```
b[i + 2] -= b[i]
```

Given `b[i]` is 0, the operation `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` translates to `b[i + 2] -= 0`, which means `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged.

Thus, the value of `b[i + 2]` is still `b[i + 2]` (it does not change).

The other variables (`a`, `i`, and the output) remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * 0`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2]`; `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 6; the output is 'YES'; `i` is 4.**
