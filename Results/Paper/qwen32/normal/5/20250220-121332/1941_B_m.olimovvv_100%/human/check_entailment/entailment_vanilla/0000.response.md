Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if, for a given array, it's possible to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`) and reduce the elements at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates over each test case and for each test case, it processes the array as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` in the array.
   - Then, it reads the array `b` of `n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It iterates over the array from index `0` to `a - 3` (i.e., `0` to `n - 3`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop. This check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that all elements are non-negative.
   - It then modifies the array elements at indices `i+1` and `i+2` by subtracting `2 * b[i]` and `b[i]` respectively from `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`, and sets `b[i]` to `0`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are both zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Inaccurate Operation Application:**
   - The program incorrectly modifies the array elements. Instead of reducing the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by `1`, `2`, and `1` respectively, it incorrectly reduces `b[i+1]` by `2 * b[i]` and `b[i+2]` by `b[i]`. This does not reflect the correct operation described in the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Feasibility:**
   - The program only checks if the last two elements are zero after processing the array. This is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the described operation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
