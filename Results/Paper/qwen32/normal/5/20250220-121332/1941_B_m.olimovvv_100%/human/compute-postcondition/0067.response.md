Output State: **`a` is greater than 3, `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` has been updated to `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` has been updated to `b[2] - b[0] - 2 * (b[1] - 2 * b[0])`, and `b[3]` has been updated to `b[3] - 2 * (b[1] - 2 * b[0])` if it exists. `i` remains 1.**

In simpler terms: `a` is still greater than 3, `b[0]` remains 0, `b[1]` has been updated to `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` has been updated to `b[2] - (b[1] - 2 * b[0])`, and if `b[3]` exists, it has been updated to `b[3] - 2 * (b[1] - 2 * b[0])`. The value of `i` remains 1.
