You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be transformed to all zeros by repeatedly subtracting twice the current element from the next element and the current element from the element after next, starting from the first element. If the transformation is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The main issue is that the program incorrectly modifies the array elements in a way that does not align with the allowed operation. Specifically, the operation defined in the problem can only be applied to indices \(i\) such that \(2 \le i \le n - 1\), and it modifies \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The provided code, however, iterates over the array starting from index 0 and incorrectly applies the operation in a way that does not preserve the original constraints.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Correct Operation:**
- Start with the array: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
- Apply the operation at \(i = 2\): `[0, 2, 3, 3, 2]`
- Apply the operation at \(i = 3\): `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2]`
- Apply the operation at \(i = 2\): `[0, 0, -1, 2, 2]` (Invalid, as it results in a negative number)

However, the provided code will incorrectly attempt to apply the operation starting from index 0, leading to invalid modifications.

**Incorrect Modification in the Code:**
- The code iterates from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3` and modifies the array elements as follows:
  - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
  - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
  - `b[i] -= b[i]`

This does not align with the allowed operation and can lead to incorrect results or negative values in the array, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
