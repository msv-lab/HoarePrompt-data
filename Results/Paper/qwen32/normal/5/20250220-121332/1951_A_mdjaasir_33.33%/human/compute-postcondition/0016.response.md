Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value provided by the user input; `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `count` is exactly 2. If the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not immediately followed by another '1', then the first occurrence of '1' is not immediately followed by another '1'. Otherwise, the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is either at index 0 or the element immediately following the first '1' is also '1'.**
