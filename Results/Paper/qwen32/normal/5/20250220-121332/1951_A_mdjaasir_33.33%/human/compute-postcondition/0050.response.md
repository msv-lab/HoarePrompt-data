Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `a`. It then counts the number of '1's in the string `a` and prints 'YES' if the count is 0, greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 with the '1's not adjacent; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.**
