Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string input by the user; `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 2 and the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1', the if part executes; otherwise, the else part executes. In both cases, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged.**
