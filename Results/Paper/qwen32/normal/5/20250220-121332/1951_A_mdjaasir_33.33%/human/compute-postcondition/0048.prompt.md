Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value provided by the user input; `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If `count` is 0, no changes are made to `count`. If `count` is greater than 0, it is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, it is even. If `count` is exactly 2, the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is either not immediately followed by another '1', or the first occurrence of '1' is at index 0 and the element immediately following the first '1' is also '1'. If `count` is not 2, then `count` is greater than 0 and either `count` is less than or equal to 2, or `count` is not an even number.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new value provided by the user input; `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `a`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the program executes the if block (the specific actions within the if block are not detailed in the postcondition). Otherwise, the program executes the else block, and the variables retain their described values with `i` incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string input by the user; `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, the if part executes. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, or if `count` is 2 and the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1', the if part executes. Otherwise, the else part executes. In all cases, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
