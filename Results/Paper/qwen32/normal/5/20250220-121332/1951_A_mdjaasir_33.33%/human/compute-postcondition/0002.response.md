`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `start` and `end` remain non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, and `t` remains greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**
