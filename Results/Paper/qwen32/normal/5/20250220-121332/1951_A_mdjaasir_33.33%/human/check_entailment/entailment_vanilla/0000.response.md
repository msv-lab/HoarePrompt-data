Reasoning:
The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates specific files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subdirectories of the current directory, where the subdirectory names are within a specified numeric range. However, the given program defines a function `func()` that reads input values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of '1's in a string and their positions. This is completely unrelated to the task described in the problem.

Given these discrepancies, the program is incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
