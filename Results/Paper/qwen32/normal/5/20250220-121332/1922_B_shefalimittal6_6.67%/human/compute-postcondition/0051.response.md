Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
