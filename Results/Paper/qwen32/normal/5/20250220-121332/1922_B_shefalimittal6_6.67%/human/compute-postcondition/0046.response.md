The code snippet provided resets the variable `res` to 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique integer `x` from `nums` has a count of how many times it appears; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is 0.**
