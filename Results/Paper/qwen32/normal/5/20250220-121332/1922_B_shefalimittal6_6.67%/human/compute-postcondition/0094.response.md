The code snippet provided adds to the variable `res` by multiplying the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time (`math.comb(cnt, 2)`) with `total_sum`. This means `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

Given the initial state, `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. After the code snippet executes, `res` will have this additional value added to it.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, `total_sum`) remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is `next_cnt`, `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum` and then increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `next_cnt`.**
