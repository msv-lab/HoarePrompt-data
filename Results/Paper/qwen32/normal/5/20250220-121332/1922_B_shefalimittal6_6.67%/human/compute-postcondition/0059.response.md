The given code snippet updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Given that:
- `res` is initially calculated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum`.
- The code snippet modifies `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + 2 * math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
