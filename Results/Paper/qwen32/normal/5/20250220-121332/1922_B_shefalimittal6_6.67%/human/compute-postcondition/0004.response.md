The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` retain their initial values, and `num_of_lens` remains an empty dictionary as it is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
