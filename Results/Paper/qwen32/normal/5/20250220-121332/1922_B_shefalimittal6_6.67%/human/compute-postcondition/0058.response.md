The code snippet calculates `total_sum` by summing all the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary except for the value that is equal to `cnt`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `total_sum` is recalculated to exclude `cnt`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `res`) remain unchanged unless `cnt` is used in the calculation of `res`, which is not directly modified in this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
