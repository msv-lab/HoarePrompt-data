The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when the variable itself is not used inside the loop). The loop will execute as long as the range specified by `t` is not exhausted. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it does not need to be adjusted in terms of its value, but the loop will continue to execute as long as the iteration count is less than `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the loop has just completed one iteration, we need to adjust the iteration count. The loop variable `_` itself is not relevant to the state we need to describe, but we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for the next iteration to reflect that one iteration has completed.

However, since the loop uses `range(t)`, the loop control is handled by the `range` function, and we don't need to manually adjust `t`. Instead, we recognize that the loop will automatically handle the iteration count.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same with respect to the variables provided, except that one iteration has been completed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.** 

Note: The value of `t` will be effectively reduced by 1 by the `range(t)` mechanism, but we do not need to explicitly state this in the provided format.
