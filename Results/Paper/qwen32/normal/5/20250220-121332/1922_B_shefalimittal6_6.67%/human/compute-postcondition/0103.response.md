To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and understand the state of the program before the `print(res)` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`t` is `n - 1`:**
   - `t` is calculated based on the input integer `n`. Specifically, `t` is one less than `n`.

2. **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `nums`:**
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from the list `nums`, and the corresponding value is the count of that element in `nums`.

3. **`nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided as input to the program.

4. **`res` is the final calculated sum of combinations:**
   - `res` is a variable that holds the final result, which is the sum of some combinations calculated based on the elements in `nums` and their counts in `num_of_lens`.

### Analysis

Given that `res` is described as "the final calculated sum of combinations," the exact value of `res` depends on the logic used to calculate it, which is not provided in the initial state. However, based on the precondition, we know that `res` is the result of some computation involving `nums` and `num_of_lens`.

### Conclusion

Since the exact computation to determine `res` is not detailed in the initial state, we can only describe `res` in terms of what it represents.

### Final Output

Output: **res (where res is the final calculated sum of combinations based on the elements in nums and their counts in num_of_lens)**
