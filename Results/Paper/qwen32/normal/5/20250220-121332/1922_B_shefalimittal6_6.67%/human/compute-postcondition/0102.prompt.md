Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `n - 1`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with counts of each unique element in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one unique element. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is exactly 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is `next_cnt`, `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `next_cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` after `next_cnt`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
