The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more value in `num_of_lens` that `cnt` can take.

At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` has taken on one of the values from `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` should be the next value from `num_of_lens`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; if `cnt` is 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
