The code snippet increments the value of `res` by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This means that if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, the value of `res` will increase by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time. If `cnt` is less than 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` will be 0, and `res` will remain unchanged. 

All other variables and their states remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
