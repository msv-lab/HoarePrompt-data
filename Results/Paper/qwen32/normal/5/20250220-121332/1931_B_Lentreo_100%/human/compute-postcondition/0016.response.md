The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers.
- `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0.
- `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`.
- `mean` is `total // n`.
- `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`.
- If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` remains greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` in each test case is divisible by `n`. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` remains greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we need to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration, we increment `i` by 1:
State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` in each test case is divisible by `n`. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i-1] - mean`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` remains greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`**

To make it clear for the next iteration:
State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` in each test case is divisible by `n`. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is the value after the previous iteration's calculation. `i` is `i + 1`**

Since the exact value of `curr` is not specified to be adjusted and only `i` is relevant for the loop condition:
State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` in each test case is divisible by `n`. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` remains greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`**

For the start of the next iteration:
State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` in each test case is divisible by `n`. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is the value after the previous iteration's calculation. `i` is `i + 1`**

Simplified for the loop head variable `i`:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`**
