The given code snippet modifies the variable `curr` by adding the difference between `nums[i]` and `mean` to it. The value of `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, indicating that `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line is executed. Therefore, the value of `curr` will be updated based on the current value of `nums` at index `i` and the value of `mean`.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`**

In natural language: The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as it was already incremented. The value of `curr` is updated to be its current value plus the difference between `nums[i]` and `mean`.
