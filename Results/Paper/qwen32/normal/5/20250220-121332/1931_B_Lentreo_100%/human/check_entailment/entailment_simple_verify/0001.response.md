Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.

### Key Points:
1. The total amount of water is divisible by `n`.
2. The operation only allows transferring water from a container to a container with a higher index.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads multiple test cases and processes each one using the function `func_1`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Calculate Total and Mean:**
   - `total = sum(nums)`: Calculates the total amount of water in the containers.
   - `mean = total // n`: Calculates the mean amount of water each container should have if equalized.

2. **Check Cumulative Difference:**
   - `curr = 0`: Initializes a running total of the difference between the current amount of water and the mean.
   - Iterates through each container:
     - `curr += nums[i] - mean`: Updates the running total with the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
     - If `curr < 0` at any point, it returns 'NO', indicating it's not possible to equalize the water using the given operation.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns 'YES', indicating equalization is possible.

### Annotations

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call: `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts in the containers.
- Inside `func_1`:
  - `total` is the sum of the water amounts in `nums`.
  - `mean` is the mean amount of water each container should have.
  - `curr` is the running total of the difference between the current amount of water and the mean.

### Issues in the Annotations

There is a critical issue in the annotations and the logic of the program:
- The annotations state that `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. However, in the code, `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts in a single test case.
- The annotations also incorrectly state that `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`, which is not accurate. `total` is correctly calculated as the sum of the integers in `nums`.

### Correctness of the Program

The core logic of the program is flawed:
- The program checks if the cumulative difference `curr` ever goes negative. While this check is valid in certain scenarios, it does not fully capture the problem constraints.
- Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of transferring water from containers with excess water to containers with less water in a way that might require intermediate steps where `curr` temporarily becomes negative but ultimately balances out.

### Counterexample

Consider the following test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
- Total water: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
- Mean water per container: `6 // 3 = 2`
- Iteration:
  - `i = 0`: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (should return 'NO' according to the program, but it's not correct)

However, it is possible to equalize the water:
- Pour 1 unit from container 2 to container 0: `[2, 1, 3]`
- Pour 1 unit from container 3 to container 1: `[2, 2, 2]`

### Conclusion

The program's logic is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the possibility of intermediate water transfers that might temporarily make `curr` negative but ultimately lead to a balanced distribution.

**Final: False**

The program does not correctly determine if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers using the specified operation.
