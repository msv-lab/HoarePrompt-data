Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1, 0, or the value of `num` if `num > cur`, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num > cur`, `M[cur]` is set to `1` and `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. If `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is further updated to either 0 or 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `num <= cur`, the value at key `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1.**
