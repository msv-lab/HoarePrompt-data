Output State: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either 0 or 1, and `num` is the next element in `N`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `M`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
