The code snippet provided is:

```
S = int(input())
```

This code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `S`. The initial state provided does not mention any specific value for `S` or any other variable it might affect. Therefore, only `S` will be updated in the output state.

Output State: **The smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i`, or `cur` if no such `i` exists; `S` is an input integer.**
