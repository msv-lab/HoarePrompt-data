The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `cur`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` must be greater than 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `cur` should remain unchanged since it is determined by the condition inside the loop body and not by the loop head.

State: **`cur` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
