In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(T):`. This means that the loop will execute `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. However, `T` must be such that the loop can execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `T` is an input integer.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`.
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be at least 1.

State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5**.
