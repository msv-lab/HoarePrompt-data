The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `N`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `S` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the new list `N`, which is populated with integers from the input.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
