Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Key Points in the Problem:
1. **Game Mechanics**: Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and deleting them. Alice adds her picks to array `c`.
2. **Objective**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob wants to minimize it.
3. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy:
- **Alice's Optimal Play**: Alice should aim to include as many small numbers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- **Bob's Optimal Play**: Bob should try to prevent Alice from including small numbers in `c` to minimize the MEX.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted, which is useful for finding the MEX.
3. **Counting and Tracking**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number in the sorted array.
4. **Finding MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array and updates the current MEX (`cur`) based on the numbers present.
   - It breaks out of the loop when it finds a gap in the sequence, indicating the MEX.
   - It also checks if all numbers up to `cur` are present in the dictionary `M` and adjusts `cur` accordingly.
5. **Output**: The final value of `cur` is printed as the MEX for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling Duplicates**: The program correctly handles duplicates.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: It seems to handle cases where all numbers are the same or when the array is empty.
- **Correctness of MEX Calculation**: The logic for finding the MEX appears correct based on the provided example and the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. It handles the given constraints and examples correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
