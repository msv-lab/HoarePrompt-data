The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, `num` iterates over each integer in the sorted list `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `S` is an input integer (though `S` does not affect the loop directly).
- `cur` is either -1, equal to the previous `num`, or updated to `num - 1` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
- `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next integer in the list `N`. Since `N` is a sorted list and `num` is the next integer after the previous `num`, we increment `num` to the next integer in the list.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either -1, equal to the previous `num`, or updated to `num - 1` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num`**.

To be more specific, if the previous `num` was `N[k]`, then the new `num` should be `N[k+1]`. However, since we don't have the exact index, we just denote it as the next integer in the list.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either -1, equal to the previous `num`, or updated to `num - 1` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`**.
