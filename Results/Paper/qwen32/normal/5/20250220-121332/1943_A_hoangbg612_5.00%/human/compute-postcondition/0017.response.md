Postcondition: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is updated to contain the entry {`cur`: 1}. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is updated to contain the entry {-1: 1}.**
