The code snippet provided sets the variable `cur` to -1. This change affects the value of `cur` while the other variables (`S` and `N`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i`, or `cur` if no such `i` exists; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `cur` is -1.**

In plain terms, the value of `cur` is now -1, and the conditions for finding the smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i` or `cur` if no such `i` exists, along with the values of `S` and `N`, remain as they were initially.
