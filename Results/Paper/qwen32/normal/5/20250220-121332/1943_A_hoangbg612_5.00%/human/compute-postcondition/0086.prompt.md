Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `M` is an empty dictionary; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `cur` is -1; The smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i`, or `cur` if no such `i` exists.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `cur` is either -1 or 0, and `num` is a value that determines `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` contains `cur` as the key with a value of 1. Otherwise, `M` contains the entry {-1: 1} and `cur` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1, 0, or the value of `num` if `num > cur`, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num > cur`, `M[cur]` is set to `1` and `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. If `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is further updated to either 0 or 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `num <= cur`, the value at key `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, and `cur` is either -1, 0, or the value of `num` if `num > cur`, and `num` is the next element in `N` (i.e., `num_next`). If `num > cur`, `M[cur]` is assigned the value `1` and `cur` is updated to `num`. If `num <= cur`, the value at key `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
