Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1 or 0, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to either 0 or 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
