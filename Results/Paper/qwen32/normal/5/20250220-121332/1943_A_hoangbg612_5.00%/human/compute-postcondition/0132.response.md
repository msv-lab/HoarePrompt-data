Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is now `cur + 1`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language explanation: The values of `N`, `S`, `cur`, and `num` remain as specified in the initial state, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
