The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. This means that after the execution, `M` will have an entry where the key is `cur` and the value is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **T is greater than or equal to 1, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; S is an input integer; N is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; cur is `num`; M is a dictionary with the entry {cur: 1}; num is greater than cur. If num is greater than cur + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
