Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the variable `S` has been assigned the value of an input integer, while all other variables (`T`, `t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
