### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the described game scenario.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted, which is not strictly necessary for the problem's solution but does not affect correctness.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The code initializes an empty dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in the array.
   - It iterates over the sorted array and updates the count of each number in `M`.

4. **Determining MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1 and is used to track the current MEX.
   - The code iterates over the sorted array and updates `cur` based on the count of each number.
   - If a number `num` in the array is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop and sets `cur` to `cur + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and increments the count in `M`.

5. **Adjusting MEX**:
   - After the loop, the code checks if the sum of the counts in `M` matches `n` (the size of the array).
   - If it does, it increments `cur` by 1, which is not necessary as the loop should already have found the correct MEX.

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The code then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any number `i` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - This step ensures that `cur` is the smallest integer such that the number of occurrences of each integer from 0 to `cur-1` in the list `a` is at least as large as the integer itself.

7. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cur` for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:

- The main logic of the code is correct in determining the MEX by ensuring that the number of occurrences of each integer from 0 to `cur-1` is at least as large as the integer itself.
- The final adjustment step is somewhat redundant but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the solution for the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
