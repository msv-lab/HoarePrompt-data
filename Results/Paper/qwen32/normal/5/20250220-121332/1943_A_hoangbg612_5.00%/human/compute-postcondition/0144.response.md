The code snippet provided is `cur = i`. This means the variable `cur` is being assigned the value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `cur` must be greater than 0, but since `cur` is now being set to `i`, the new value of `cur` will be whatever the value of `i` is at the time of execution. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and the condition `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is equal to `i`, and `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**
