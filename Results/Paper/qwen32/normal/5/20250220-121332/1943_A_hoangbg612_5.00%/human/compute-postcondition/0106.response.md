The code snippet `S = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `S`. This means the value of `S` changes based on the user's input, but the values of `M`, `N`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`; `S` is an input integer; `N` remains unchanged; `cur` is the smallest `i` such that `M[i] <= i`.**
