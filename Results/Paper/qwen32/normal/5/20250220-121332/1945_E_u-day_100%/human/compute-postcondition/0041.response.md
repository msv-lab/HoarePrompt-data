Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `low` and `high` are consecutive integers.
- `st` contains all the midpoints used in the binary search.
- `pos` and `arr` are unchanged.
- `n` and `k` are unchanged.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`low` and `high` are consecutive integers**:
   - This means `high = low + 1` or `low = high + 1`. Since `low` and `high` are used in a binary search context, it's more likely that `high = low + 1`.

2. **`st` contains all the midpoints used in the binary search**:
   - This doesn't directly affect the values of `low` or `pos` for this print statement, but it's part of the context of the binary search.

3. **`pos` and `arr` are unchanged**:
   - `pos` is likely the position of the element `k` in the array `arr` if found, or some indicator if not found. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `pos` might be an indicator of not found or some other value.

4. **`n` and `k` are unchanged**:
   - `n` is probably the length of the array `arr`.
   - `k` is the key we are searching for in the array `arr`.

5. **`arr[low]` is not equal to `k`**:
   - This tells us that the element at index `low` in the array `arr` is not the key `k` we are searching for.

### Print Statement Analysis:
- `low + 1`: Since `low` and `high` are consecutive, and `high = low + 1`, `low + 1` would be `high`.
- `pos + 1`: The value of `pos` is not specified, but it could be an index or a flag. Given the context, if `pos` is an index where `k` is not found, `pos + 1` would be `pos + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output `high` and `pos + 1`.

Output: **high, pos + 1 (where high is the integer consecutive to low and pos is the position indicator in the binary search)**
