The code sets `low` to the value of `mid`. Therefore, `low` will now have the value `n // 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `k` is still the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is still the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is still the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `high` is still `n`.
- `st` is still a set containing `mid`.
- `mid` is still `n // 2`.
- `arr[mid]` is still less than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is `n // 2`, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
