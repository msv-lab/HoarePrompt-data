The code snippet `arr = func_2()` assigns the value returned by `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`. After executing the code, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, while `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.**
