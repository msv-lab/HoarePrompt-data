The code snippet provided updates the value of `mid` to be the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. This change does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The preconditions that `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, and `high` must be at least `low + 2` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` must be at least `low + 2`.**
