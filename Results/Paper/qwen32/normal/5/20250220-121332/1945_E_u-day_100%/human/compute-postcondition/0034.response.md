The code snippet `low = mid` updates the value of `low` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `(low + high) // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` must be at least `low + 2`, `low` is equal to `mid`.**
