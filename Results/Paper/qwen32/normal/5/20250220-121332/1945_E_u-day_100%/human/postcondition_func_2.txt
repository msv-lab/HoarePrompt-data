The function finds the position of a given integer `k` in a permutation `arr` of length `n`. It then performs a binary search to determine a specific condition related to `k` in the permutation. If `k` is found at the position indicated by the binary search (`low`), it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by `low + 1` and the position of `k` in the permutation (`pos + 1`).
