To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop behaves and converges.

The loop is a binary search loop that continues to narrow down the range `[low, high)` until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. This means the loop will terminate when `low` and `high` are consecutive indices, i.e., `high` is `low + 1`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `low = 0`
   - `high = n`
   - `st` is an empty set.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - `while low + 1 < high`: This loop will run until `low` and `high` are consecutive.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - `mid = (low + high) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the current range.
   - `st.add(mid)`: This adds the midpoint to the set `st`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high = mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low = mid`.

### Convergence:
- The loop effectively halves the range `[low, high)` in each iteration.
- The loop terminates when `low` and `high` are consecutive, meaning the search space has been reduced to a single element.

### Final State:
- After the loop terminates, `low` will be the index where the binary search would place `k` if it were in the array, or the largest index such that all elements before it are less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` will be `low + 1`.
- The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were considered during the search.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:

- `low` and `high` will be consecutive.
- `st` will contain all the midpoints that were used in the binary search.
- `pos` and `arr` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `n` and `k` will remain unchanged as they are initial values.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`low` and `high` are consecutive, `st` contains all the midpoints used in the binary search, `pos` and `arr` are unchanged, `n` and `k` are unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop will stop when `low` and `high` are next to each other.
- The set `st` will have all the indices that were checked during the binary search.
- The values of `pos`, `arr`, `n`, and `k` will remain the same as they were initially.
