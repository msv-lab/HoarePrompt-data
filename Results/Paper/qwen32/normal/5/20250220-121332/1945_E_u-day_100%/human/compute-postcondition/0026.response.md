The code snippet `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Initially, `st` contains only `mid`. After adding `mid` again, the set `st` will still contain `mid` but will not have any duplicate entries since sets do not allow duplicates. Therefore, the set `st` will remain unchanged in terms of its contents.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `mid`, `low`, `high`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is `0` or `n // 2`, `high` is `n // 2` or `n`.**
