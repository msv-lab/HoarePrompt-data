After the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have taken on every value from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `pos` will either remain `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, or it will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `pos` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that matches `k`, or `-1` if no such element exists. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial values.
