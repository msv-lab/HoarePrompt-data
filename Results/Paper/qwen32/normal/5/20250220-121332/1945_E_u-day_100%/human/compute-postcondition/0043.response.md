Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), `k` (a positive integer representing the number to be found such that 1 <= k <= n), and `arr` (a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly once). The function returns the k-th smallest element in the permutation `arr`.**
