Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is `0` or `n // 2` and `high` is `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n // 2` or `n`.**
