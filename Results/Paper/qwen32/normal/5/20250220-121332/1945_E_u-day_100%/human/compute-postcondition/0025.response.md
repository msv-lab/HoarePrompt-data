Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is `0` or `n // 2`, `high` is `n // 2` or `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is recalculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The values of `low` and `high` depend on the condition whether `arr[mid]` is greater than `k` or not, which was set before the code snippet. The other variables remain unchanged.
