The given initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the provided print statement. The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This variable is not referenced in the print statement.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is an integer read from the input.
3. **Variable `m`**: It is an integer read from the input, and it is given that \(n \geq m\) and the difference \(n - m\) is even. This variable is also not referenced in the print statement.

Since the print statement does not use any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
