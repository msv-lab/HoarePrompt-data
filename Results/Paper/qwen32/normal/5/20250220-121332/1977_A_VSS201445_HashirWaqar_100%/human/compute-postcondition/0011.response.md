Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is either true or false, but in either case, `n` and `m` maintain their original values and the relationship between them remains the same as described in the precondition. If `n >= m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even.**
