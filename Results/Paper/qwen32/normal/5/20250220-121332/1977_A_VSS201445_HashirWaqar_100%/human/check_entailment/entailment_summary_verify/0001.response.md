Reasoning: 
The original assessment provides a clear and accurate explanation of the logic behind the problem. Let's break down the conditions and the function summary to ensure that the program correctly implements this logic.

1. **Condition `n < m`**: 
   - If the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it is impossible for Nikita to build a tower with `m` cubes because he can only add one cube per move. Therefore, the program correctly identifies this scenario and outputs "NO".

2. **Condition `n >= m`**:
   - When `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes if and only if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) does not change the number of cubes in the tower. Hence, any remaining moves must be additions to reach the desired number of cubes. 
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` correctly checks if the difference is even, ensuring that the remaining moves can be used to add the exact number of cubes needed to reach `m`.

The function summary accurately describes the logic of the program, which aligns with the reasoning provided in the original assessment. The program iterates through each test case, reads the values of `n` and `m`, and applies the conditions to determine if it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program correctly implements the required logic.

Final: **True**
