Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `n` and `m` were integers read from the input, and the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` was evaluated. If the condition was true, "YES" was printed; otherwise, "NO" was printed. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` from the input remain unchanged in the context of the precondition, and no further iterations are left to execute.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.
