### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.

Let's break down the logic used in the program:
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Possible Moves**: In each move, either a cube is added or removed from the tower.
3. **Final State**: We need to check if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

For the final state to be achievable:
- The total number of moves `n` must be sufficient to reach `m` cubes, i.e., `n` should be at least `m` because we can only add cubes up to `n` times.
- The difference between `n` and `m` should be even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube. To reach a specific number of cubes `m` from 0, the number of additions and subtractions must balance out in such a way that the net effect is `m` cubes. If `n - m` is even, it means we can have an equal number of additions and subtractions (plus or minus the necessary moves to reach `m`).

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if `n >= m` to ensure there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
- It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to ensure the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the moves to balance out correctly.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
