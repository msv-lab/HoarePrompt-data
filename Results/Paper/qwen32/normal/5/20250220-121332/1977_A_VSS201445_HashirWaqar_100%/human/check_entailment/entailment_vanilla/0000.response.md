Reasoning:  
To determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, we need to consider the nature of the operations available to him: he can either add one cube or remove one cube per move.

Let's break down the conditions:
1. If `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves he has.
2. If `n >= m`, it is possible to end up with m cubes if and only if the difference between the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) leaves the number of cubes unchanged, and any remaining moves must be additions to reach the desired number of cubes.

The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference is even, which means that the remaining moves (after accounting for pairs of additions and removals) can be used to add the exact number of cubes needed to reach m.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
