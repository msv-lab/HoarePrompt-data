You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, we need to consider the nature of the operations available to him: he can either add one cube or remove one cube per move.

Let's break down the conditions:
1. If `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves he has.
2. If `n >= m`, it is possible to end up with m cubes if and only if the difference between the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) leaves the number of cubes unchanged, and any remaining moves must be additions to reach the desired number of cubes.

The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference is even, which means that the remaining moves (after accounting for pairs of additions and removals) can be used to add the exact number of cubes needed to reach m.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
