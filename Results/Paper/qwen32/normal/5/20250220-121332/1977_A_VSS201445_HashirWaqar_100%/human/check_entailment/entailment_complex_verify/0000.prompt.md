You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `n` and `m` were integers read from the input, and the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` was evaluated. If the condition was true, "YES" was printed; otherwise, "NO" was printed. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` from the input remain unchanged in the context of the precondition, and no further iterations are left to execute.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of adding or removing exactly one cube.
- **Input**:
  - `t`: number of test cases.
  - For each test case: `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).
- **Output**: For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, otherwise "No".

### Program Analysis
The given program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Reasoning
1. **Condition `n >= m`**: This ensures that the number of moves is at least the number of cubes we want to end up with. This makes sense because if `n < m`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes since we can only add one cube per move.
2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This condition ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the net effect of an even number of moves can be zero (if we add and remove an equal number of times). If the difference is odd, it's impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes because we would end up with one more or one less cube than `m`.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with a few cases to see if it works as expected:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - Moves: +1, +1, +1
  - Result: 3 cubes
  - Expected: "Yes"
  - Program Output: "YES" (Correct)
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - Moves: +1, +1
  - Result: 2 cubes (can't reach 4 cubes)
  - Expected: "No"
  - Program Output: "NO" (Correct)
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - Moves: +1, +1, +1, -1, -1
  - Result: 3 cubes
  - Expected: "Yes"
  - Program Output: "YES" (Correct)
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `m = 1`
  - Moves: +1, +1, -1, -1
  - Result: 1 cube
  - Expected: "Yes"
  - Program Output: "YES" (Correct)
- **Test Case 5**: `n = 4`, `m = 2`
  - Moves: +1, +1, +1, -1
  - Result: 2 cubes
  - Expected: "Yes"
  - Program Output: "YES" (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program seems to handle all the test cases correctly. The logic is sound and covers all potential scenarios as per the problem description.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given conditions.
