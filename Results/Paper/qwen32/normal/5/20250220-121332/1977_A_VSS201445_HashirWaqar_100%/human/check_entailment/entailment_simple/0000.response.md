### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic in the program correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem is to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower. The key observation here is that:

1. If `n` (the number of moves) is less than `m` (the desired number of cubes), it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes because we can only add cubes, and we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
2. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because we can make `m` moves to add cubes and then use the remaining `n - m` moves to balance out by adding and removing cubes in pairs, which will only be possible if `n - m` is even (since each pair of moves cancels each other out).

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

### Answer:
Correctness: **True**
