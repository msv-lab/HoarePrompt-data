Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is either true or false based on the new values of `n` and `m`; `iterations_left` is the number of iterations left to execute, which is `int(input()) - 1`. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` determines whether the if or else part was executed, but the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `iterations_left` remain as specified in the precondition regardless of the condition outcome.**
