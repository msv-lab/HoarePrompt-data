Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the next character in the `password` string, `letters` is a list that includes `ch` as its last element, `digits` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the character `ch` to the `letters` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `password`, and `ch` remain unchanged. The `digits` list is not affected by this operation.
