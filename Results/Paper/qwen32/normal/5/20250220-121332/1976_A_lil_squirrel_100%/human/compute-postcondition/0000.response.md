The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `letters`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `password`. Therefore, the state of `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `password` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list.**
