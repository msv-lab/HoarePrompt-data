The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `password`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `password`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that `i < len(password) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `len(password) - 1`.

Given that `i` was the last valid index for which `i < len(password) - 1` in the previous iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration. The length of `password` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. The list `letters` is sorted, and the list `digits` is sorted. Additionally, either `password[i]` and `password[i + 1]` are not both such that `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, or `i` is out of bounds for the string `password`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` was 3 in the previous iteration and the loop condition is `i < len(password) - 1`, `i` should now be 4 (assuming the previous `i` was 3).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. The list `letters` is sorted, and the list `digits` is sorted. Additionally, either `password[i]` and `password[i + 1]` are not both such that `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, or `i` is out of bounds for the string `password`, `i` is 4**.
