### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to verify if a password meets certain criteria to be considered strong. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (length of the password) and the password string itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Separation of Letters and Digits**: The function iterates through the password string and separates the letters and digits into two different lists (`letters` and `digits`).
   - **Sorting Check**:
     - It checks if the list of letters is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
     - It checks if the list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - **Digit Following Letter Check**:
     - It iterates through the password string and checks if any digit comes immediately after a letter. If such a pair is found, it returns `'NO'`.
   - If all the above checks are passed, it returns `'YES'`.

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly separates letters and digits.
   - It verifies that both the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that no digit comes immediately after a letter.
   - The provided example cases match the expected output, indicating that the logic correctly implements the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given password is strong according to the specified conditions.

**Correctness: True**
