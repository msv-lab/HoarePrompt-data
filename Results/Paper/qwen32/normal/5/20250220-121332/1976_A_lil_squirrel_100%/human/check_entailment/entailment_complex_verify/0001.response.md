### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly meets all the problem conditions.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.
   - The password string is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Function `func_1(n, password)`:**
   - Two lists, `letters` and `digits`, are initialized to store letters and digits from the password, respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - Otherwise, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - The program then checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Next, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - After that, the program iterates over the password string to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, the program returns 'YES'.

3. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** The problem statement assumes valid inputs, so the program does not need to explicitly check for invalid characters.
   - **Condition 2:** The program correctly checks that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking each character against the next one.
   - **Condition 3:** The program correctly checks if the digits are sorted by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version.
   - **Condition 4:** The program correctly checks if the letters are sorted by comparing the `letters` list to its sorted version.

### Annotations:
The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points, and they align with the expected behavior of the program. Specifically:
- The `letters` and `digits` lists are correctly populated.
- The program checks if both lists are sorted.
- The program correctly checks for a digit following a letter.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the provided annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
