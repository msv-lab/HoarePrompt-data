You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 for each testcase, and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. The list `letters` is sorted.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. The list `letters` is sorted, and the list `digits` is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 20, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from password, and digits is a list containing all the digits from password. The list letters is sorted, and the list digits is sorted. The loop has completed all iterations without finding a pair where the first character is a lowercase Latin letter and the second is a digit.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of the password, and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function checks the password against specific criteria and returns 'NO' in five different cases and 'YES' in one specific case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'NO'

Case_6: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
