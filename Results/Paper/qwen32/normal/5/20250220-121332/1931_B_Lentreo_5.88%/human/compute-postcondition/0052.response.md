The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If there are more elements in the `nums` list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is updated based on the value of `i` and `last`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to take the next value from the `nums` list. Since the previous iteration used the current value of `i`, the next iteration should use the next element in the list.

Let's denote the next element in the list as `next_i`. The state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is `next_i`, and if `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.**

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we only need to update `i`:

State: **`i` is `next_i`**
