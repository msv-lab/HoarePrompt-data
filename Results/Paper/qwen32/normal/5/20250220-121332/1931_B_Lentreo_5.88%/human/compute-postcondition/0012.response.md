Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `nums` after the last one considered. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.**
