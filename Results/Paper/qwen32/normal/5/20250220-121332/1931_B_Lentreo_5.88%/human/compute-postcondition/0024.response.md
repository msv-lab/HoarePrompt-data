The provided code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `nums`. This means the previous `nums` list is overwritten with the new input list. The variables `last` and `curr` are no longer valid as they were calculated based on the previous `nums` list. The value of `n` (the new input integer) is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input, `last` is no longer valid, `curr` is no longer valid.**
