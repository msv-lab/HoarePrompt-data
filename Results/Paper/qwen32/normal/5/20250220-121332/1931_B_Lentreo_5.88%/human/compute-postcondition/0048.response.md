The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. Therefore, the state of `nums` is the only one we can adjust to ensure the loop can execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `nums` must contain at least one element. The states of the other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `last`, and `curr`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this, the state should be adjusted to ensure `nums` has at least one element.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is 0**
