Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `last` is the last element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.**
