### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if it is possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the specified operation. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect.

Here's why:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to check if the water in all containers can be made equal by pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.

2. **Condition for Equalization**: For equalization to be possible, the total amount of water must be divisible by the number of containers `n`. This condition is already satisfied as per the problem statement, so we don't need to check it again.

3. **Operation Analysis**: The operation allows us to pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`. This means we can always move water from left to right, and the key observation is that if the sum of the first `k` containers is less than the average, we can pour water from the remaining containers to balance it out.

4. **Incorrect Logic in the Program**: The program calculates `curr` as the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`. This logic does not correctly determine if the water can be equalized. The program does not consider the cumulative sum and whether it can be balanced out by the subsequent containers.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve checking if the cumulative sum of the containers can be adjusted to match the target value (which is the total sum divided by `n`). This can be done by iterating through the list and ensuring that the cumulative sum can be balanced out by the remaining containers.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be equalized in all containers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
