The value of `curr` is updated by adding the result of `i - last` to its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is `curr + i - last`**.
