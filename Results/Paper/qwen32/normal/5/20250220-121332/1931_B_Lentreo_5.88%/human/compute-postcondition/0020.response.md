Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

Here's the breakdown of the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from input.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- `curr` is the sum of (i - last) for all i in `nums` except the last element, where i is not 0, and `curr` is not equal to 0.

However, the `print` statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, or `curr`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
