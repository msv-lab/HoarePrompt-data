In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used inside the loop body. The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range it iterates over is `t`. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only thing we need to consider for the loop to execute. 

The provided state already specifies that `t` is an integer read from input such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. This means that for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. 

The other variables `n`, `a`, and the conditions related to them are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They are relevant to what happens inside the loop body, not to whether the loop starts executing.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted (though it already satisfies the condition) is that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
