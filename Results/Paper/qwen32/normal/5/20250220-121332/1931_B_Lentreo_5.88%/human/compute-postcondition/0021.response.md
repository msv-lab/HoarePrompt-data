Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is the sum of (i - last) for all i in nums except the last element, where i is not 0. If `curr` is 0, then no further changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged and is not equal to 0.**
