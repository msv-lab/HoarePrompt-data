test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers (sum of n over all test cases) does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
