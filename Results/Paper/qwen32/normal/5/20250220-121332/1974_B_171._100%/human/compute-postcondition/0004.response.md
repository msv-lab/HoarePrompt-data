The code snippet assigns a value to the `char_map` dictionary by mapping each character in `unique_chars` to another character from the end of the `unique_chars` list. Specifically, `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` is set to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.

This means that the first character in `unique_chars` will be mapped to the last character, the second character to the second-to-last character, and so on.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0.**
