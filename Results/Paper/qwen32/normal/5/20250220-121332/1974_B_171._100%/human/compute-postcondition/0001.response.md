The provided code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `char_map`. This action does not affect the values of `encoded` or `unique_chars`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
