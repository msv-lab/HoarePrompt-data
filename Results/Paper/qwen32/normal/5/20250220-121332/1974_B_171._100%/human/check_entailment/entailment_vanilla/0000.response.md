### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure it correctly implements the decoding process as described.

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - From the string `s`, a new string `r` is constructed which contains all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given the encoded string `b`, we need to reverse the encoding process to get back the original string `s`.
   - To do this, we need to construct the string `r` from `b` by identifying all unique characters in `b` and sorting them alphabetically.
   - We then create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - Finally, we replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character according to this mapping to get the original string `s`.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - The code reads the input, processes each test case, and applies the `func_1` function to decode each encoded string.
   - The `func_1` function correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `b`, sorts them, and creates the mapping from each character to its symmetric character.
   - It then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - Let's verify the code with the provided example.
   - For the encoded string "serofedsoc", the unique characters are "cdefors". The mapping is: c -> s, d -> r, e -> o, f -> e, o -> e, r -> d, s -> c.
   - Applying this mapping to "serofedsoc" gives us "codeforces", which is the correct original string.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the decoding process described in the problem statement. It accurately reconstructs the original string `s` from the encoded string `b` for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
