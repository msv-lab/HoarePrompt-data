Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `char_map` dictionary is constructed and used.

The code creates a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters of the encoded string to its symmetric character in the reverse order. However, this mapping is incorrect for decoding because it does not map the encoded characters back to their original characters. Instead, it maps the characters in the encoded string to their symmetric counterparts in the unique characters list, which is not what the problem requires.

To correctly decode the string, we need to reverse the mapping process. We should map each character in the unique characters list to its symmetric counterpart in the reverse order and then use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
abcba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
abcba
```

**Actual Output from the program:**
```
ababa
```

The program incorrectly decodes the string because it does not map the encoded characters back to their original characters correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should construct the `char_map` dictionary such that each character in the unique characters list is mapped to its symmetric counterpart, and then use this mapping to decode the encoded string correctly.
