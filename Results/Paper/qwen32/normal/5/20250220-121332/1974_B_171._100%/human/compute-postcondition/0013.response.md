Functionality: **The function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains an integer and a string. It returns a single string formed by mapping each character in the input strings to a corresponding character based on a mapping derived from the unique characters present in all input strings. The mapping pairs the first unique character with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on.**
