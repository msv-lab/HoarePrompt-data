To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop iterates over the range of `len_unique`, which is the length of the list `unique_chars`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len_unique` is set appropriately for the loop to execute.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for i in range(len_unique):`. This means the loop will execute `len_unique` times, with `i` taking values from 0 to `len_unique - 1`.

2. **Dependencies**: The loop execution depends on `len_unique`. If `len_unique` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. If `len_unique` is 0, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjustments**: 
   - `len_unique` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts and will be incremented automatically during each iteration.
   - `unique_chars` is already described as a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded`. The length of this list is `len_unique`, so we need to ensure it has at least one element.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- `len_unique` must be greater than 0.
- `unique_chars` must be a list with at least one element (since its length is `len_unique`).

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0**.
