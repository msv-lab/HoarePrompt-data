The code snippet modifies the `char_map` dictionary by updating the mapping of the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` to the character at the mirrored index from the end of `unique_chars`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the mapping of `unique_chars[0]` will be updated to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1]`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` except `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is `'b'` and `char_map[unique_chars[0]]` is now `unique_chars[len_unique - 1]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the character at the first position of `unique_chars` is now mapped to the character at the last position of `unique_chars` in `char_map`. All other mappings remain unchanged except for the mapping of `unique_chars[1]` which is still `'b'`.
