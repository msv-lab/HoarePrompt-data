### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to decode a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` of distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then encoding `s` by replacing each character with its symmetric character from `r`.

The decoding process should reverse this encoding by:
1. Extracting the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them to form `r`.
2. Creating a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, etc.).
3. Using this mapping to transform each character in the encoded string `b` back to the original characters in `s`.

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - For each test case, `func_1` is called with the encoded string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first determines the unique characters in `b` and sorts them to form `unique_chars`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

The annotations and the code logic seem to correctly reverse the encoding process described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly constructs the mapping and applies it to the encoded string to produce the original string.
