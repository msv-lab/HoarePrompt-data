The code modifies the `char_map` dictionary by setting the value of `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`. Given that `i` is initially set to `len_unique`, the expression `unique_chars[i]` is out of bounds since list indices in Python are zero-based. This will result in an `IndexError`.

However, if we assume there might be a typo or a misunderstanding in the problem statement and that `i` should be within the valid range (0 to `len_unique - 1`), we can proceed with the assumption that `i` is a valid index. 

Given this assumption, the output state would be:

- `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` is now mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

For the sake of providing a valid output state, let's assume `i` is within the valid range, and let's use a specific example to illustrate this.

Let's assume:
- `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`
- `len_unique` is `3`
- `i` is `1` (a valid index within the range)

Then `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` (which is `char_map['b']`) will be set to `unique_chars[3 - 1 - 1]` (which is `unique_chars[1]` or `'b'`).

However, since the problem states `i` is `len_unique`, this would be out of bounds, and if we strictly follow the problem statement, an error would occur. But for the sake of providing a valid output state, we can assume `i` is within bounds.

Assuming `i` is `1`:
- `char_map['b']` is set to `'b'`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` except `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is now `'b'`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `len_unique`**

If `i` is indeed `len_unique`, the code would raise an `IndexError`, and the output state would not be well-defined in the context of the given problem constraints. Therefore, the output state based on the assumption that `i` is within bounds is provided above.
