Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `len_unique`. `char_map` is fully populated such that the first character in `unique_chars` maps to the last character in `unique_chars`, the second character maps to the second-to-last character, and so on.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, each unique character in `unique_chars` will be mapped to its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in the `char_map` dictionary. The `encoded` list and `unique_chars` list remain unchanged, and `len_unique` retains its value as the length of `unique_chars`. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `len_unique` once the loop has completed all its iterations.
