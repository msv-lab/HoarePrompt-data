#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `len_unique`. `char_map` is fully populated such that the first character in `unique_chars` maps to the last character in `unique_chars`, the second character maps to the second-to-last character, and so on.`
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by mapping each character in the strings within `encoded` using `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains an integer and a string. It returns a single string formed by mapping each character in the input strings to a corresponding character based on a mapping derived from the unique characters present in all input strings. The mapping pairs the first unique character with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on.
