The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `len_unique`. If `i` is less than `len_unique`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len_unique`, which means the loop has just finished executing.

To execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len_unique`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 0 to start the loop from the beginning.

State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` except `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is now `'b'`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is 0**
