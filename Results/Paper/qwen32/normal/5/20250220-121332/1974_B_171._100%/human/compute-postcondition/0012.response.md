Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n`, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by mapping each character in the strings within `encoded` using `char_map`.**
