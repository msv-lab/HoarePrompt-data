The `input()` function in the provided code snippet reads a line of input from the user but does not assign it to any variable. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `m` is 1, and this value is preserved.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. The current value of `m` is 1.**
