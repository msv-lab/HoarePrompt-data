Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains at least one more tuple `(a3_new, l3_new)`, `l` is updated based on the last iteration's conditions. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further action is taken regarding the loop or if statement.**
