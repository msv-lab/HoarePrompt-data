The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that `val` will now contain an additional element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` is updated based on conditions, `l22` is updated based on conditions, `idx1` is updated based on conditions, `idx2` is updated based on conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on conditions, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**

In simple terms, `val` now includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previously described conditions.
