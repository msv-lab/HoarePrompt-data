Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is `i`; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of due to the `break` statement.
