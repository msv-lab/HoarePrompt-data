Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input, decreased by 1 if `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3` or `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3` or `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early; `idx1` and `idx2` are the indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` or `-1` if no such pair is found; `p1` and `p2` are `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`; `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` for each of the `m-2` iterations; `a3` is the first integer from the input of each iteration; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input of each iteration; `l` is a list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`; `_` is `0` indicating all iterations have completed; the loop has either printed 'yes' if `l3` was equal to `l` with all instances of `a3` removed for all iterations, or 'no' if it broke out early due to a mismatch.`**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state includes all the variables as defined initially, but the loop variable `_` is now `0`, indicating that all iterations have been completed. The loop will have printed either 'yes' if `l3` matched `l` with all instances of `a3` removed for all iterations, or 'no' if it broke out early due to a mismatch.
