Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 5, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, `i` is 4, `idx1` is set to 4 or `idx2` is set to 4, `p1` is set to 1 or `p2` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `idx1` and `idx2` are set to 4, and either `p1` or `p2` is set to 1 based on the condition checked. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
