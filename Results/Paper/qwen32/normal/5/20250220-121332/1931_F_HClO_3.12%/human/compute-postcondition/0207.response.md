The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Given the initial state, none of the variables are modified by the `continue` statement. The loop simply proceeds to its next iteration without changing the values of any variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is 2; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is an empty list; `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`; `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`; `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet.**
