Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 6, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, `i` is 5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In plain terms, the values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
