The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program other than skipping the remaining code in the current iteration and moving to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change any variable values or states. It merely indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from the input; `m` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 3; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early; `idx1` and `idx2` are the indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` or `-1` if no such pair is found; `p1` and `p2` are `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`; `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` for each of the `m-2` iterations; `a3` is the first integer from the input of each iteration; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input of each iteration; `l` is a list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`; `_` is `m-2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet; `m-3` additional input lines have been consumed.**
