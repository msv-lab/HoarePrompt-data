The code snippet appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The initial state indicates that `_` is incremented by 1, but since `_` is not used in the code snippet, it remains unchanged. The values of `a3` and `l3` are taken from the input and are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input; `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)`**.
