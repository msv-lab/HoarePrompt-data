Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless `m` was 2 in which case `m` becomes 1, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` remain the same unless `a2` was inserted into `l2` in the else part, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise they are -1, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` were encountered, otherwise they are 0, `val` is an empty list if `idx1 <= idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers. If `idx1 > idx2`, `idx1` is incremented by 1, and `l` becomes `l1`. If `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2` and `l` becomes `l1`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1` and `l` becomes `l2`.**
