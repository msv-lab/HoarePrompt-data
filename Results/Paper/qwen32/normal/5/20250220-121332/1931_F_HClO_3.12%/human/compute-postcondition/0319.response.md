The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the index `idx1` in the list `l2`. This operation will shift all elements to the right of `idx1` one position to the right.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the same
- `m` is the same
- `a1` is the same
- `a2` is the same
- `l2` is the same
- `l22` is the same
- `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise they are -1
- `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` were encountered, otherwise they are 0
- `val` is an empty list
- `idx1` is less than `idx2`

After the insertion:
- The list `l2` will have `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`, and all subsequent elements will be shifted.
- The value of `idx1` remains the same, but the value of `idx2` will increase by 1 because the insertion shifts elements to the right.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the same, `m` is the same, `a1` is the same, `a2` is the same, `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, `l22` is the same, `idx1` is the same, `idx2` is `idx2 + 1`, `p1` is the same, `p2` is the same, `val` is an empty list**
