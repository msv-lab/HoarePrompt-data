Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer greater than 2; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at `idx2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a2` in `l3` is less than or equal to the index of `a1` in `l3`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2` (before the insertion); `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to the previous contents of `val`; `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from `l2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, or `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `_` is `m-3` if `l11 != l22`, otherwise `_` is `0`; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `idx1` was less than `idx2` initially, otherwise `idx1` is not less than `idx2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3`**.

In simpler terms, the `val` list now includes an additional tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to its previous contents. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
