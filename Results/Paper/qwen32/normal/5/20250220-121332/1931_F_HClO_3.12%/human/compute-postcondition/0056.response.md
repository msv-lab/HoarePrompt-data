Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is equal to `i` and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is equal to `i` and `p2` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. The only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
