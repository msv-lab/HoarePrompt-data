The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is at least 5. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to 5, provided that `n` is at least 6 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 6, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, and `i` is 5.**
