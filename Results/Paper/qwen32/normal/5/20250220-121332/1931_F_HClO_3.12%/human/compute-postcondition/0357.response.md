The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a3` and `l3`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. If there are more tuples in `val`, the loop will execute again with the next tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `val` contains at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must contain at least one more tuple.

Let's denote the next tuple in `val` as `(a3_new, l3_new)`.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains at least one more tuple `(a3_new, l3_new)`, `l` is updated based on the last iteration's conditions. If `l3_new` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3_new` removed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**
