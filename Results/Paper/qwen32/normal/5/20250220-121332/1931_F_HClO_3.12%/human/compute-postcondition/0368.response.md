Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of screenshots and their respective authors. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to reorder the screenshots such that the specified authors are at the top of their respective lists and the order of other authors is consistent across all lists. The function outputs "yes" if such a reordering is possible, otherwise "no".**
