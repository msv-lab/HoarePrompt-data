Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input, decreased by 1 if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` is not 2; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at `idx2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a2` in `l3` is less than or equal to the index of `a1` in `l3`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2` (before the insertion); `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is an empty list if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` is not 2; `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from `l2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, or `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `idx1` was less than `idx2` initially, otherwise `idx1` is not less than `idx2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` is not 2; `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` is not 2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer greater than 2; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at `idx2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a2` in `l3` is less than or equal to the index of `a1` in `l3`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2` (before the insertion); `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` is not 2; `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from `l2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, or `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `_` is 1 if `l11 == l22`, otherwise `_` is `m-2`; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `idx1` was less than `idx2` initially, otherwise `idx1` is not less than `idx2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3`; `val` is now a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to the previous contents of `val`.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
