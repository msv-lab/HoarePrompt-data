Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the condition holds true, otherwise, no specific action is taken regarding `l11` and `l22`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is at least 5, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, and `i` is 4. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to the variables. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 4 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to 4, and either `p1` or `p2` is set to 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is at least 6, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, and `i` is 5. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the state remains unchanged. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
