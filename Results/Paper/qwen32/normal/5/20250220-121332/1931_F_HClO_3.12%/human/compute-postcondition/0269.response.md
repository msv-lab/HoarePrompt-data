The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or if statement that it is contained within. However, since there is no loop or if statement explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, we can assume that the `break` statement is part of a larger context not provided here. Given the context and the variables provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it will exit the innermost loop or if statement.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
