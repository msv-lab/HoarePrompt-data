The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state only mentions `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000. Since `t` is not affected by the code snippet, it remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `m` are introduced and assigned specific integer values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.**
