Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly identifies the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each password, the function `func_1(password)` is called.
   - This function initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates over each character in the password, appending digits to `digits` and letters to `letters`.

3. **Password Validation in `func_1`**:
   - The function tracks the last index where a digit is found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (`last_digit_index` is not -1), it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
   - If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **Condition 1**: The program correctly checks that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` method to separate characters into `digits` and `letters` lists.
- **Condition 2**: The program correctly checks that no digit comes after a letter by keeping track of the last digit's index and ensuring no letters are found after this index.
- **Condition 3**: The program correctly checks that all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4**: The program correctly checks that all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list to its sorted version.

### Annotations Evaluation:

- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The annotations indicate that the program correctly identifies when a letter follows a digit and returns 'NO' in such cases.
- The annotations also correctly state that the program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted and returns 'NO' if they are not.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions. The annotations support this conclusion by showing the correct behavior at key points in the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
