The only variable in the loop head is `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in the `password` string, the loop will execute again for the next character.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last processed character of the `password` string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in the `password` string to process. Therefore, `char` should be the next character in the `password` string.

Since we do not know the exact characters in the `password` string, we can only state that `char` will be the next character in the sequence. However, we can update the state of `char` to reflect that it will be the next character in `password`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `char` is the next character in the `password` string. If the current character `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If the current character `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing `char`.**
