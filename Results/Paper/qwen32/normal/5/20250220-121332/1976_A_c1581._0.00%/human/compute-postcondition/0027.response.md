The code `last_digit_index = i` sets the value of `last_digit_index` to the current value of `i`, which is 1. The values of other variables (`password`, `n`, `char`, `digits`, and `letters`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 1; otherwise, `last_digit_index` is 1. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.**
