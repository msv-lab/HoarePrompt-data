Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to 2 and the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` remains -1. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.**
