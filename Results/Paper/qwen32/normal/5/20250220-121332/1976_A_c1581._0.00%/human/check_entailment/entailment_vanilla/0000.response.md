Let's go through the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
    - The first element in this list is the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each password, it calls the function `func_1(password)` which evaluates if the password meets the criteria for being a strong password.
    - The results of these evaluations are stored in a list called `results`.

3. **Password Validation in `func_1`**:
    - It initializes two empty lists: `digits` and `letters`.
    - It iterates over each character in the password:
        - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
        - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
    - It then checks for the condition that no digit comes after a letter:
        - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found (`last_digit_index`).
        - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), it immediately returns 'NO'.
    - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    - If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Output**:
    - After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each test case, each on a new line.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Condition 1**: The program correctly checks that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` method to separate characters into `digits` and `letters` lists.
- **Condition 2**: The program correctly checks that no digit comes after a letter by keeping track of the last digit's index and ensuring no letters are found after this index.
- **Condition 3**: The program correctly checks that all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4**: The program correctly checks that all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list to its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
