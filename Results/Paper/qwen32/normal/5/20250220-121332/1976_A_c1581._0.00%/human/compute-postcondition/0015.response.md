Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `char` is the next unprocessed character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list that includes `char` as its last element. Otherwise, `letters` is a list that includes `char` as its last element.**
