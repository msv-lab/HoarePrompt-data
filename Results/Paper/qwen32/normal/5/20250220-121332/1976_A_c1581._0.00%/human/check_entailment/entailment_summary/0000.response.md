### Reasoning:

1. **Condition Parsing**:
   - The program checks for three main conditions:
     1. All digits must appear before any letters.
     2. Digits must be in non-decreasing order.
     3. Letters must be in non-decreasing order.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program reads the input and processes each password separately.
   - It separates the digits and letters into two different lists.
   - It then checks if there are any letters that appear before a digit, which would violate the first condition.
   - It checks if the digits list and the letters list are sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The program iterates through the password to find the last occurrence of a digit. If a letter is found after this last digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It then checks if the digits and letters are sorted. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases match the expected behavior:
     - For the password "12ac", digits are before letters, and both are sorted, so the output is 'YES'.
     - For the password "123wa", the letters are not sorted, so the output is 'NO'.
     - For the password "allllmost", there are no digits, and letters are sorted, so the output is 'YES'.
     - For the password "ac123", a digit appears after a letter, so the output is 'NO'.
     - For the password "011679", there are no letters, and digits are sorted, so the output is 'YES'.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. It checks for the order of digits and letters and whether each group is sorted. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
