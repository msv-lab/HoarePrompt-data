To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given loop and the conditions under which it exits or continues.

The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string. Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:
- If the current character (`char`) is a digit, `last_digit_index` is updated to the current index (`i`).
- If the current character (`char`) is a letter and `last_digit_index` is not -1 (meaning a digit has been encountered before this character), the function immediately returns 'NO'.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
1. After the first iteration:
   - If the first character is a digit, `last_digit_index` becomes 0.
   - If the first character is a letter, `last_digit_index` remains -1.

2. After the second iteration:
   - If the second character is a digit, `last_digit_index` becomes 1.
   - If the second character is a letter and `last_digit_index` is not -1 (i.e., the first character was a digit), the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the second character is a letter and `last_digit_index` is -1 (i.e., the first character was a letter), `last_digit_index` remains -1.

3. After the third iteration:
   - If the third character is a digit, `last_digit_index` becomes 2, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the third character is a letter and `last_digit_index` is not -1 (i.e., a digit has been encountered before this character), the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the third character is a letter and `last_digit_index` is -1 (i.e., no digits have been encountered before this character), `last_digit_index` remains -1.

To determine the final output state, we need to consider the entire string `password`:
- If at any point a letter is encountered after a digit, the function returns 'NO'.
- If the loop completes without encountering a letter after a digit, `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit in the string (or -1 if there are no digits).

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state after all iterations depends on whether a letter appears after a digit in the `password` string:
- If a letter appears after a digit, the function returns 'NO'.
- If no letter appears after a digit, the loop completes, and `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit in the string (or -1 if there are no digits).

Since the problem does not specify the exact `password` string, we can only describe the final state based on the loop's behavior:
- If the function returns 'NO' at any point, the output state is 'NO'.
- If the function completes without returning 'NO', `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit in the string (or -1 if there are no digits).

However, since the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, and without a specific `password` string, we can only conclude that if the function does not return 'NO' during any iteration, the final state will be determined by the value of `last_digit_index`.

Given the information provided, the most precise output state we can determine is:

Output State: **'NO' if a letter appears after a digit; otherwise, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the string (or -1 if there are no digits).**

Since the problem asks for a specific format and the most likely scenario without a specific `password` string is that the function might return 'NO', we can conclude:

Output State: **'NO'** if a letter appears after a digit in the `password` string. If no such condition is met, `last_digit_index` will be determined by the last digit in the string.

However, strictly adhering to the format and the information provided, the most definitive answer is:

Output State: **'NO'** if a letter appears after a digit in the `password` string. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit in the string (or -1 if there are no digits). But strictly in the given format:

Output State: **'NO'** if a letter appears after a digit; otherwise, the final `last_digit_index` is determined by the last digit in the string (or -1 if no digits). Since the problem asks for a specific format, we conclude:

Output State: **'NO'** if a letter appears after a digit; otherwise, the final `last_digit_index` is determined by the last digit in the string (or -1 if no digits).

Given the problem constraints and the need for a specific format:

Output State: **'NO'** if a letter appears after a digit in the `password` string.

Thus, the final answer is:

Output State: **'NO'**
