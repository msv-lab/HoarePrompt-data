Let's systematically evaluate the given program against the problem description using the function summary and the original assessment. We will verify if the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the provided conditions.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and processes it accordingly. It handles multiple test cases and reads the length of each password and the password string itself correctly.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each password to determine if it meets the criteria for being a strong password.
   - The results of these evaluations are stored in a list called `results`.

3. **Password Validation in `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two empty lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - The function then checks for the condition that no digit comes after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found (`last_digit_index`).
     - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **Condition 1**: The program correctly checks that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` method to separate characters into `digits` and `letters` lists.
- **Condition 2**: The program correctly checks that no digit comes after a letter by keeping track of the last digit's index and ensuring no letters are found after this index.
- **Condition 3**: The program correctly checks that all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4**: The program correctly checks that all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list to its sorted version.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`, and the original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets all the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
