Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, all the digits from the `password` will be collected in the `digits` list, and all the lowercase letters will be collected in the `letters` list, both in the order they appear in the `password`.
