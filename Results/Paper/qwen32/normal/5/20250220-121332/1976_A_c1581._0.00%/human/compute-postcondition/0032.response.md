The code snippet provided updates the value of `last_digit_index` to the current value of `i`, which is 2. This change does not affect the values of `password`, `n`, `char`, `digits`, or `letters`. Since the code does not include a return statement, the function does not terminate early. The condition that `char` being a digit results in a 'NO' return is not evaluated or changed by this code snippet.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to 2; otherwise, `last_digit_index` remains -1. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear. `last_digit_index` is 2.**
