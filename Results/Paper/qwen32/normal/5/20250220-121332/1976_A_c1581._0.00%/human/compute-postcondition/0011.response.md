Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `char` is the next character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing `char` and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing `char`.**
