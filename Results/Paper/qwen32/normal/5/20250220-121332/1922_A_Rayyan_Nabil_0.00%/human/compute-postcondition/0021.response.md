The code snippet `a = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `a`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string.**
