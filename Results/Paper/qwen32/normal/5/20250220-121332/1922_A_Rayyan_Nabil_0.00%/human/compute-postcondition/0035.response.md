To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the condition under which the variable `l` is set to 'YES' or 'NO'. According to the initial state, `l` is set to 'YES' if there is at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) where both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If no such index exists, `l` is set to 'NO'.

Given the information, we don't have specific values for the lists `a`, `b`, and `c`, nor do we know the value of `n`. Therefore, we can only describe the output based on the condition provided.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check the condition**: For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, check if both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
2. **Determine `l`**:
   - If there is at least one index `i` where both conditions are true, `l` is set to 'YES'.
   - If no such index exists, `l` is set to 'NO'.
3. **Print `l`**: The value of `l` will be printed.

Since we don't have the specific lists `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can't determine the exact value of `l`. However, we can describe the output based on the given condition.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO')**
