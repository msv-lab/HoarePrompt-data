Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new input strings, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` remains 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'YES'.**

Since the `else` part is not specified and the `l` variable remains 'YES' in both the `if` part and the implicit `else` part, the overall postcondition can be simplified to just stating that `l` remains 'YES' after the execution of the if-else block. Here is the revised postcondition:
