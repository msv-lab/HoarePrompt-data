The code snippet `c = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `c`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO', `i` is `x + 1`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input, `c` is the user's input.**
