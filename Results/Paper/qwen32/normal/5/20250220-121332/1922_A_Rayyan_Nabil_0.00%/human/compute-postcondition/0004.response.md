The code snippet `a = input()` assigns the value of the new input to the variable `a`. This means that the previous value of `a`, which was a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, is replaced by whatever the new input is.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `l` is 'YES'**.
