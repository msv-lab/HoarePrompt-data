Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 20, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
