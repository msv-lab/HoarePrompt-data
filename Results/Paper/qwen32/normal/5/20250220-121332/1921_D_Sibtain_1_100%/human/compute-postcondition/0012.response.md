The `continue` statement in Python is used within loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop structure. Therefore, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, and the length of `a` is 1; `c` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order. If the first (and only) element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then all elements in `a` and `c` are the same. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and `a` is sorted.**
