Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0; `k` is `len(a) - 1`; `i` is 0; `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` have been explicitly assigned new values in the provided code snippet. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code.
