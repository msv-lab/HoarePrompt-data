The value of `t1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between the `i`-th elements of `a` and `c`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t2`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `t1` was initially `abs(a[0] - c[0])` or `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])` depending on the comparison between `t1` and `t2`. Now, `t1` is specifically set to `abs(a[i] - c[i])`.

If `t2` is greater than `t1` initially, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, making `t1` now equal to `abs(a[0] - c[0])`. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, making `t1` now equal to `abs(a[1] - c[1])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` is 1 and the first (and only) element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then all elements in `a` and `c` are the same. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and `a` is sorted. `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**
