Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is 0, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`, and `t2` is greater than `t1`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
