Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `c` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order. If the length of `a` is 1 and the first (and only) element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then all elements in `a` and `c` are the same. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and `a` is sorted.**
