The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables or perform any calculations. Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged after the `continue` statement is executed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for all iterations, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` and `j` are updated based on the comparisons in each iteration. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the specific actions described in the if part are performed. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
