Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is 0, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**
