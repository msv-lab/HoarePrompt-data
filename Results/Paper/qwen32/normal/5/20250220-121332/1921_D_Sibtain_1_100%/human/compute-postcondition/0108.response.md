The code calculates the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of the sorted list `a` and the `i`-th element of the sorted list `c` in descending order, and assigns this value to `t1`. This calculation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, or `k`; only `t1` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is the previous `ans` plus `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`.**
