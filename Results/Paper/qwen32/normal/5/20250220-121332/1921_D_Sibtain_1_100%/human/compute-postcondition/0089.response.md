Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for all iterations, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` and `j` are updated based on the comparisons in each iteration. If `len(a) == 1` and all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the specific actions described in the if part are performed. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
