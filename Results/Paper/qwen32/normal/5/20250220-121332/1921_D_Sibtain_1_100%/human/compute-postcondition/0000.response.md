To determine the state before the for loop starts such that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The loop will execute based on the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. 

Here, the integer value is derived from `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is at least 1. Given that `1 <= t <= 100`, the loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be within this range.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only involves the input value `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is an integer within the specified range. 

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
