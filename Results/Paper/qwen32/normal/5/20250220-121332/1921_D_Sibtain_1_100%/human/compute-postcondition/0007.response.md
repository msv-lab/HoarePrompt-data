Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `c` is a list of integers read from the input. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and no changes are made to the variables.**
