Output State: **`i` is `x - 2`; `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1` and `num` equals 1; `count` is the number of times `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` was 1 for `i` from `0` to `x - 2` plus 1.**

This means that `count` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `i` and `num` remain the same as in the initial state.
