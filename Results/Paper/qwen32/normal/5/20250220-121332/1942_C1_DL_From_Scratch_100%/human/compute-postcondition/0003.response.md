The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `list0`. This means that `list0` will now hold the `x` distinct integers that were read from the input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input, `y` is the third integer read from the input, The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `list0` is a list containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
