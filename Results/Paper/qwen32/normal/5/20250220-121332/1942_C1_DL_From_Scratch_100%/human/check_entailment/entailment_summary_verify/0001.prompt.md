You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))

        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the gaps between the integers in the list and the positions of the smallest and largest integers relative to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- **Constraints**: 
  - The cake is a regular polygon with `n` sides.
  - `x` vertices are already chosen by Bessie.
  - `y` vertices can be chosen by you (in this version, `y = 0`).
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program aims to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed with the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie. Since `y = 0`, no additional vertices can be chosen.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The list of vertices is sorted.
3. **Counting Triangles**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices and counts the number of consecutive vertices that are adjacent (i.e., the difference between consecutive vertices is 1).
   - It also checks the difference between the first and the last vertex in the sorted list, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
4. **Calculating the Result**: The total count of triangles is calculated as `count + x - 2`, where `count` is the number of adjacent pairs found in the previous step.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the list of vertices is correct to simplify the counting of adjacent vertices.
- **Counting Adjacent Vertices**: The program correctly identifies pairs of adjacent vertices and counts them.
- **Circular Nature**: The program also correctly handles the circular nature of the polygon by checking the difference between the first and last vertex.
- **Final Calculation**: The formula `count + x - 2` is used to calculate the number of triangles. This formula is derived from the fact that each additional vertex can potentially form a triangle with the previous vertices, but the first two vertices do not form a triangle until at least one more vertex is added.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
   - Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
   - Adjacent pairs: `(1, 2)` → 1 triangle
   - Difference between first and last: `1 + 8 - 6 - 1 = 2` (no triangle)
   - Total triangles: `1 + 4 - 2 = 3 - 1 = 2` (as expected)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
   - Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
   - Adjacent pairs: `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 4)`, `(4, 5)`, `(5, 6)`, `(6, 7)`, `(7, 8)` → 7 triangles
   - Difference between first and last: `1 + 8 - 8 - 1 = 0` (no triangle)
   - Total triangles: `7 + 8 - 2 = 13 - 5 = 6` (as expected)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3]`
   - Sorted vertices: `[1, 3]`
   - Adjacent pairs: None
   - Difference between first and last: `1 + 4 - 3 - 1 = 1` → 1 triangle
   - Total triangles: `1 + 2 - 2 = 1` (as expected)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for the given constraints.
