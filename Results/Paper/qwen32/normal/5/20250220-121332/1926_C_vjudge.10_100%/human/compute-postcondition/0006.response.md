The code snippet provided is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. This line of code increments the variable `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4)
- `inf` is 200001
- `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0
- `i` is 1
- `sum_value_digits` is 0

The variable `x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the code snippet. For the purpose of this task, we will assume `x` is a string that can be converted to an integer.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `sum_value_digits` will be updated. Since the initial value of `sum_value_digits` is 0, it will now be equal to `int(x)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**.
