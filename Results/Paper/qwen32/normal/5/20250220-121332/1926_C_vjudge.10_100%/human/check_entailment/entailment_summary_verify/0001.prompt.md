You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to a given number `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `2 * 10^5 + 1` to store cumulative sums of the digit sums up to each integer from 1 to `2 * 10^5`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - It iterates through each integer `i` from 1 to `2 * 10^5`.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`).
   - It updates the `values` array such that `values[i]` contains the cumulative sum of digit sums from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and outputs `values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Preprocessing**:
  - The preprocessing step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers up to `2 * 10^5`. This ensures that for any test case, the program can quickly look up the required cumulative sum.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The preprocessing step runs in `O(k * m)` time, where `k` is the maximum value of `n` (i.e., `2 * 10^5`) and `m` is the average number of digits in the numbers from 1 to `k`. Given `k` is `2 * 10^5`, `m` is at most 6 (since `2 * 10^5` has 6 digits). Thus, the preprocessing step runs in `O(1.2 * 10^6)` operations, which is within the time limit of 0.5 seconds.
  - Each test case is processed in constant time `O(1)` by simply looking up the precomputed value in the `values` array.

- **Correctness of Output**:
  - The program correctly outputs the sum of the digit sums for each test case by leveraging the precomputed cumulative sums.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient given the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
