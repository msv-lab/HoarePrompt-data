The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable iterating over the characters in the string representation of `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current iteration's progress.

Given:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4),
- `inf` is 200001,
- `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0,
- `i` is `t + 2`,
- `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`,
- `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the last character of the string representation of `i`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be the next character in the string representation of `i`, if there are any more characters.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `str(i)`, and we are at the end of the previous iteration, `x` should be set to the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Convert `i` to its string representation.
2. Determine the current position of `x` in the string representation of `i`.
3. Set `x` to the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact position of `x` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume that `x` has completed its iteration over the string representation of `i`. Therefore, there are no more characters left in the string representation of `i` for `x` to iterate over, and the loop will not execute again.

However, if we assume that the previous iteration was not the last one, `x` would be set to the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Let's assume the string representation of `i` has more than one character and `x` was the second last character in the previous iteration. Then, `x` should be set to the last character in the string representation of `i`.

For example, if `i` is 123 and `x` was '2' in the previous iteration, then `x` should be '3' in the current iteration.

Given the problem statement, we need to adjust `x` to the next character in the string representation of `i`. Since the problem does not specify the exact position, we assume `x` is set to the next character.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`, `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`**

Since we don't have the exact position of `x` in the string representation of `i`, we can't determine the exact value of `x` without more information. However, we can generalize that `x` should be set to the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration, assuming there are more characters to iterate over, would be:
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`, `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`**

Since we need to provide a concrete example, let's assume `i` is 123 and `x` was '1' in the previous iteration. Then, `x` should be '2' in the current iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`, `x` is '2'**

However, without more specific information, the most general answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`, `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`**
