The code snippet updates the `values` list at index `i` by adding `sum_value_digits` to the value at index `i - 1`. Given the initial state, `values[i - 1]` is 0 because all elements in `values` are initialized to 0. Therefore, `values[i]` will be equal to `sum_value_digits`. 

The other variables (`t`, `inf`, `i`, and `sum_value_digits`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 1`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `t`.**
