Let's go through the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `2 * 10^5 + 1` to store cumulative sums of the digit sums up to each integer from 1 to `2 * 10^5`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - It iterates through each integer `i` from 1 to `2 * 10^5`.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`).
   - It updates the `values` array such that `values[i]` contains the cumulative sum of digit sums from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and outputs `values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Preprocessing**:
  - The preprocessing step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers up to `2 * 10^5`. This ensures that for any test case, the program can quickly look up the required cumulative sum.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The preprocessing step runs in `O(k * m)` time, where `k` is the maximum value of `n` (i.e., `2 * 10^5`) and `m` is the average number of digits in the numbers from 1 to `k`. Given `k` is `2 * 10^5`, `m` is at most 6 (since `2 * 10^5` has 6 digits). Thus, the preprocessing step runs in `O(1.2 * 10^6)` operations, which is within the time limit of 0.5 seconds.
  - Each test case is processed in constant time `O(1)` by simply looking up the precomputed value in the `values` array.

- **Correctness of Output**:
  - The program correctly outputs the sum of the digit sums for each test case by leveraging the precomputed cumulative sums.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient given the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
