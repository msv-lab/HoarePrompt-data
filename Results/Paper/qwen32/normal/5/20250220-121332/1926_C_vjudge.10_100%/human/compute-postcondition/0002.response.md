The code snippet creates a list named `values` with a length of `inf` (which is 200001), and initializes all elements of this list to 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it has already been assigned the value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0.**
