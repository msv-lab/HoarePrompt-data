The provided code initializes a new variable `sum_value_digits` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `inf`, or `i`. The value of `i` is already defined as `t + 3`, and `inf` remains 200,001. 

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200,001, `i` is `t + 3`, `sum_value_digits` is 0**.
