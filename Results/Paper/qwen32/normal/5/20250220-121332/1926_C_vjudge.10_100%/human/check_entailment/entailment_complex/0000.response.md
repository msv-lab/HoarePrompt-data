### Reasoning:
The provided program `func_1` correctly solves the problem by first precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to 200,000 and storing these cumulative sums in the `values` list. For each test case, it simply looks up the precomputed cumulative sum for the given `n` and prints it. This approach ensures that each test case is handled efficiently, even with up to 10,000 test cases, as each lookup operation is O(1).

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `values` of size 200,001 (to accommodate indices from 0 to 200,000) with all elements set to 0.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to 200,000, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - It then updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i-1]` and the digit sum of `i`. This effectively stores the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

This method ensures that the program can handle the upper limits of the problem constraints efficiently, as the precomputation is done once and each test case is processed in constant time.
