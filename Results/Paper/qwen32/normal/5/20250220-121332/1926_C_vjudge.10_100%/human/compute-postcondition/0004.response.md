The code snippet initializes a variable `sum_value_digits` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `inf`, `values`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this new initialization.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0**.
