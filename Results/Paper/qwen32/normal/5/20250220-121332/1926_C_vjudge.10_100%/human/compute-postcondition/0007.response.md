The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `i`. Since `x` is derived from `str(i)` in each iteration, the only variable we can directly adjust to change the state for the next iteration is `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for x in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next value of `i` that would make the loop execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. The string representation of `i` is "1", and the loop has already processed this single character. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented to a value that results in a string with at least one character.

Since `i` is currently 1, the next logical value for `i` that would allow the loop to execute again is 2 (as "2" has one character).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**

However, note that `sum_value_digits` is dependent on the loop body, which is omitted. Since we are only adjusting variables in the loop head, we do not change `sum_value_digits` directly. The value of `sum_value_digits` would be recalculated based on the loop body when the loop executes with the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the final adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0, `i` is 2**
