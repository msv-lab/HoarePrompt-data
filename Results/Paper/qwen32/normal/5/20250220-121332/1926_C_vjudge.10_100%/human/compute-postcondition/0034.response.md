The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, it seems that `t` is already in a valid state to ensure the loop executes. However, to adhere strictly to the requirement of adjusting the state based on the loop head, we can explicitly state that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000, `i` is 200001**
