The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state where `right` is 2, it will now be 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `s[right]` is not '0'. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightOne` is -2. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is -1.**
