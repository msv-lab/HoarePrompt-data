Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 1, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is either -1 or -2, `rightZero` is 3, `rightOne` is 1, `leftOne` is -1`**

Natural language explanation: The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `leftZero` was initially 0, it is now -1. If `leftZero` was initially -1, it is now -2. All other variables remain unchanged.
