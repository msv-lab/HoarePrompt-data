Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 2`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is less than `n // 2`, `rightZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`. If the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rightZero` remains unchanged. `leftOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`. If the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is decremented by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` remains unchanged. `rightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 2) // 2`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `leftMove` is 0.**
