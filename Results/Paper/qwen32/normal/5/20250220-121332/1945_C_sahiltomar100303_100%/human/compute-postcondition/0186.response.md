The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' else 3.

After the increment:
- If `s[i]` is '0', `trightOne` was 1 and becomes 2.
- If `s[i]` is not '0', `trightOne` was 3 and becomes 4.

Therefore, the updated value of `trightOne` is either 2 or 4 based on the value of `s[i]`.

Output State: **`left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `mid + 1`; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' else 1; `rightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' else 0; `rightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' else 3; `trightOne` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0' else 4.**
