The code snippet provided is `trightOne -= 1`, which decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. Given the initial state, `trightOne` is initially 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `trightOne` will be -1.

Output State: **`left` is 0; `right` is 2; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `s[right]` is not '0'; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightOne` is -1; `tleftOne` is 1**.
