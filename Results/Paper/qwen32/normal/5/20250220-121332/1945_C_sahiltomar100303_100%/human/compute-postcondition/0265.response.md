Given the initial state provided, we need to determine the value of `right` that will be printed. Here's the relevant part of the initial state:

- `right` is 3
- `n` is 3
- `right is not equal to n` (though this seems contradictory since `right` is 3 and `n` is 3, we will proceed with the given value of `right`)

The print statement is:
```python
print(right)
```

From the initial state, we know that `right` is explicitly set to 3. There are no operations or conditions that modify the value of `right` before the print statement.

Thus, the output will be the value of `right`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
