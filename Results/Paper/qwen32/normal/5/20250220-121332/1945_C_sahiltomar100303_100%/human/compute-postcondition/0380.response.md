Given the initial state:
- `left` is 0
- `right` is 8
- `t` is 2
- `a` is 3
- `n` is 8
- `s` is "11001100"
- `mid` is 4
- `leftMove` is 0
- `leftZero` is 0
- `tleftZero` is 4
- `rightZero` is 5
- `rightOne` is 3
- `trightZero` is 3
- `trightOne` is 2
- `leftOne` is 3
- `tleftOne` is 3`

The task is to determine what will be printed when the `print(left)` statement is executed.

From the initial state, we see that the variable `left` is explicitly given a value of 0.

Therefore, the `print(left)` statement will output the value of `left`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
