Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are 3 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 2, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[0]` is not '0'. Otherwise, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are 2 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 1, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are 2 or 3 depending on whether `s[0]` is not '0'.**
