The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`. The string `a` contains only '0' and '1', representing residents' preferences for living on the left or right side, respectively. For each test case, the function determines and prints the optimal split point in the string such that the number of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side is as balanced as possible.
