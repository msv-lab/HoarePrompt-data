Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The initial state of the string `a` and the integer `n` are not affected.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 0 or `left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`. If `left` is 0 and `right` equals `n`, the condition `rightOne` being greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` determines whether the condition in the if part holds. If `left` is not 0 and `right` equals `n`, the condition `left != 0` is true. If `right` does not equal `n` and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, the condition in the else part holds. If `left` is 0, `tleftZero` is compared to the threshold `(n + 1) // 2`, which is 2. If `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to 2, it meets or exceeds the threshold; otherwise, it is less than the threshold.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: left is 0, right is 3, t is 3, a is 3, n is 3, s is the input string, mid is 1, leftMove is 0, leftZero is 0, tleftZero depends on s[1] and s[2], rightZero is 2, rightOne is 0, trightZero depends on s[1] and s[2], trightOne depends on s[1] and s[2], leftOne is 1, tleftOne depends on s[1] and s[2]. If right is not equal to n, then the condition right != n is true. If right is equal to n, then rightOne is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or less than (n + 1) // 2. If left is not 0, and right equals n, the values of the variables remain unchanged. If left is not 0 and right is not equal to n, the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right, or the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` is 0 or `left` is not 0, `right` is 8, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is 8, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 4, `rightZero` is 5, `rightOne` is 3, `trightZero` is 3, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 3, `tleftOne` is 3`. If `left` is 0, the current value of `right` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` (which is 4.5), then `rightOne` is at least 5. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` (which is 4.5). If `left` is not 0, and `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
