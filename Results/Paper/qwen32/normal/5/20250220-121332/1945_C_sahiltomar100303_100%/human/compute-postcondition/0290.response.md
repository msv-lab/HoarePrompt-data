The code snippet `leftZero += 1` increments the value of the variable `leftZero` by 1. According to the initial state provided, `leftZero` is not explicitly mentioned, so we can infer that it is being initialized to 0 for the first time or it was 0 before this operation. After this operation, `leftZero` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is 1, `leftZero` is 1**.
