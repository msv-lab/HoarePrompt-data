The given Python code snippet sets `trightZero` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` depends on `s[1]` and `s[2]`, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftOne` depends on `s[1]` and `s[2]`.**
