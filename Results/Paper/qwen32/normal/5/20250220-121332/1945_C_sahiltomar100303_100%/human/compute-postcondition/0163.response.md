The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged. The precondition that `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0 still holds. The only change is in the value of `tleftZero`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is increased by 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 1**.
