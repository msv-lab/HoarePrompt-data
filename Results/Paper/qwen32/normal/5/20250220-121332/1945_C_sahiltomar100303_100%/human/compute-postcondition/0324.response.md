The code snippet `leftMove = 0` sets the variable `leftMove` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` is 4, `right` is 3, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is 8, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first 4 characters of "11001100", `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first 4 characters of "11001100", `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 2, `trightZero` is 2, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first 4 characters of "11001100", `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first 4 characters of "11001100"**.

In simpler terms, `leftMove` is set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
