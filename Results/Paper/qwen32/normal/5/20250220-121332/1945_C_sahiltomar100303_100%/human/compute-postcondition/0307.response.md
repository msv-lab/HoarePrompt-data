The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial value of `rightOne` is 0, so after the increment, it becomes 1.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, and `s[i]` is not '0'**.
