Postcondition: **`left` must be greater than 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is either 4 or 2, `rightOne` is either 0 or 1, `trightZero` is 1, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is either -1, -2, or 0, `rightOne` is either 1 or 2, `leftOne` is either -1 or -2`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 4, `rightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is either -1 or -2, and `rightOne` is 1. Otherwise, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or -1, and `rightOne` is 2.**
