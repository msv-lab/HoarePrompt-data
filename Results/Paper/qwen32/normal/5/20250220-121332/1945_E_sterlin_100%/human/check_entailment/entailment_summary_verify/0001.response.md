### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in its evaluation of the provided code. The code snippet only includes functions to read input (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`) and does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically:

1. **Input Reading**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are correctly defined to read different types of input, but they do not process or use this input to solve the problem.

2. **Logic to Solve the Problem**: The core logic required to manipulate the permutation and perform the binary search is entirely absent. The problem requires strategic swapping of elements to ensure that the binary search ends with `p_l` being `x`. This logic is not implemented in the provided code.

3. **Output**: The code does not output the number of swaps or the indices of the elements that were swapped, which is a requirement for the problem.

Given the above points, the provided code is indeed incomplete and cannot be considered correct for solving the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
