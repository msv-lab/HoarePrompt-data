The code snippet provided reassigns values to `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`. Here's the breakdown of the changes:

- `dist` is reassigned to `abs(n / 2)`, which is the same as its initial value.
- `ans` is reassigned to `0`.
- `pos` is reassigned to `0`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o_r` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0; `b_d` is the minimum distance from `n / 2` where the condition was met.**
