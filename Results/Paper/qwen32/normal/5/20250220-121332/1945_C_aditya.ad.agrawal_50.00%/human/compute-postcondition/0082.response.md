The code snippet `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `i`, `pos`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and contains at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and has at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is increased by 1; `z_l` is increased by 1.**
