The variable `o` is assigned the count of the digit `1` in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the input provided by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`, `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`, and `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`.**
