The code snippet provided only takes an input string and assigns it to the variable `input_string`. None of the other variables are affected by this input operation. Therefore, the values of `pos`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, `b_d`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **After all iterations, `pos` will be equal to the length of `arr` (i.e., `n`). `z_l` will be equal to the number of 0s in `arr`. `o_l` will be equal to the number of 1s in `arr`. `z_r` will be 0. `o_r` will be 0. `ans` will be the position where the condition was last met, indicating the position closest to the middle of the array that satisfies the balance condition. `b_d` will be the minimum distance from the middle that satisfied the condition. `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer. `input_string` is the input provided.**
