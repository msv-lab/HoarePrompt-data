The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1 before the decrement.

State: **After all iterations, `pos` will be equal to the length of `arr` (i.e., `n`). `z_l` will be equal to the number of 0s in `arr`. `o_l` will be equal to the number of 1s in `arr`. `z_r` will be 0. `o_r` will be 0. `ans` will be the position where the condition was last met, indicating the position closest to the middle of the array that satisfies the balance condition. `b_d` will be the minimum distance from the middle that satisfied the condition. `t` must be greater than 0**
