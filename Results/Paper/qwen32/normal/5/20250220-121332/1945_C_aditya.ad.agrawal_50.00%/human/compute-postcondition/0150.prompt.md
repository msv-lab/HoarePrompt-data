Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations, `pos` will be equal to the length of `arr` (i.e., `n`). `z_l` will be 0. `o_l` will be 0. `z_r` will be equal to the number of 0s in `arr`. `o_r` will be equal to the number of 1s in `arr`. `ans` will be 0. `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer. `input_string` is the input provided. `arr` is a list of integers converted from `input_string`. `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`. `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`. `dist` is equal to `abs(n / 2)`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, then `b_d` will be equal to `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` will be 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, then `ans` is set to the current value of `pos`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to the current value of `pos` and `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. The conditions involving `o_r`, `z_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` remain as they were, and the changes to `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r` based on the value of `i` are still valid.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is increased by 1 if `i == 0` and decreased by 1 if `i != 0`, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i == 0` and increased by 1 if `i != 0`, `o_l` is increased by 1 if `i != 0` and decreased by 1 if `i == 0`, `o_r` is decreased by 1 if `i != 0` and increased by 1 if `i == 0`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. The conditions involving `o_r`, `z_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` remain as they were, and the changes to `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r` based on the value of `i` are still valid.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
