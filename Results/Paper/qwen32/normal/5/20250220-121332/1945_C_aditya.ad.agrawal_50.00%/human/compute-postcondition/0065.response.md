The code snippet provided sets the variable `b_d` to the value 30001. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, `pos`, and the previous value of `b_d` are all unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o_r` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0; `b_d` is 30001.**
