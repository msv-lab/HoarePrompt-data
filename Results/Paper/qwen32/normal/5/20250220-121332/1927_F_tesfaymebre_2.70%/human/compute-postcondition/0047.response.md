The only objects in the loop head are the variables `w`, `u`, and `v`, which are unpacked from the tuples in the `edges` list. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `edges` list. If the list has at least one more tuple, the loop will execute again for the next tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `edges` was a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight. Since we have just completed one iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are now working with the next tuple in the list.

Given that `edges` must contain at least one tuple, after the first iteration, `edges` will still contain at least one more tuple. We need to update `w`, `u`, and `v` to the next tuple in the list.

State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times. `edges` is a list of `m-2` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple. `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the next tuple in `edges`. `dsu` is a DSU object with an updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the previous iteration. `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight found so far, and `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge` if `_min_edge` was updated in the previous iteration, otherwise, they remain `-1`. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent pointers after the union in the previous iteration.**
