### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure to identify cycles and keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each set (component).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`.
   - It then reads the edges, each consisting of two vertices and a weight.

2. **Union-Find Data Structure:**
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `find` method is used to find the root of a vertex.
   - The `union` method is used to merge two components and update the minimum edge weight in the resulting component.

3. **Finding Cycles:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of weight.
   - The program iterates through the edges in this order, attempting to union the vertices of each edge.
   - If the vertices of an edge are already in the same component (i.e., a cycle is detected), the edge is considered as part of the cycle, and the minimum edge weight in the cycle is updated.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Once a cycle is detected, the program uses DFS starting from one of the vertices in the cycle to find the actual cycle.
   - The DFS function (`dfs`) is used to traverse the graph and identify the cycle.
   - The `colors` array is used to keep track of visited nodes during the DFS.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also outputs the vertices of the cycle in the order they were visited during the DFS.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **DFS Function (`dfs`):**
  - The `dfs` function is not defined within the provided code snippet, which is a critical issue.
  - The `dfs` function is essential for identifying the cycle after a cycle is detected using the Union-Find structure.
  - The `dfs` function should be defined properly to ensure the correct cycle is found and printed.

- **Graph Definition:**
  - The `graph` variable is defined within the `func_6` function but is used in the `dfs` function, which is not defined in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError` if the `dfs` function is implemented outside `func_6`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the `dfs` function not being defined and the `graph` variable not being accessible in the `dfs` function, the program is **incorrect** as it will not run as intended.

**Correctness: False**
