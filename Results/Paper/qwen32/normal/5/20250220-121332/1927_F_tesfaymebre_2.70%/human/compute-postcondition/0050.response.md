The code `dsu.union(u, v, w)` updates the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to union the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` with the weight `w`. This operation affects the internal state of `dsu` but does not change the values of `graph`, `edges`, `w`, `u`, `v`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, `node_v`, `parent_u`, or `parent_v` directly.

The internal state of `dsu` reflects the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`. The exact values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` after the union operation depend on the internal implementation of the `DSU` class, but for the purposes of this task, we assume that `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` will reflect the new union state.

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-2` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the next tuple in `edges`; `dsu` is a DSU object with an updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the current iteration; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight found so far, and `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge` if `_min_edge` was updated in the previous iteration, otherwise, they remain `-1`; `parent_u` is the root parent of `u` as found by `dsu.find(u)` after the current iteration; `parent_v` is the root parent of `v` as found by `dsu.find(v)` after the current iteration.**
