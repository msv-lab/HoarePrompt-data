The only variables in the loop head are `w`, `u`, and `v`, which are derived from the `edges` list. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the `edges` list must still have at least one tuple remaining.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `edges` must have contained at least one tuple, and after the previous iteration, one tuple has been processed. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `edges` must still have at least one tuple left.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `w`, `u`, and `v` will take the values of the next tuple in the `edges` list.
- `edges` will have one less tuple than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the exact values of `w`, `u`, and `v` depend on the contents of `edges`, we can't specify their exact values without knowing the contents of `edges`. However, we know that `edges` must still have at least one tuple.

State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times, `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively. Otherwise, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, then the sets containing `u` and `v` are merged in `dsu`, `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')`, and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of the merged set.**

Note: The exact values of `w`, `u`, and `v` are not specified because they depend on the next tuple in `edges`.
