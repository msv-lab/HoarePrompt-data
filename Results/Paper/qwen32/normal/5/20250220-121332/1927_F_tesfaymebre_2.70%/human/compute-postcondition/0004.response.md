To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of calling `func_6()`. However, the function `func_6()` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables or the program state. Given the lack of definition for `func_6()`, the only information we can confidently include in the output state is the precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 1, as no other changes are specified.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1**.
