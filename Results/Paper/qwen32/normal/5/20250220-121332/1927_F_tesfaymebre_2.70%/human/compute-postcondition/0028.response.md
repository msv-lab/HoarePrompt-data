Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr` (an integer representing the current vertex), `parent` (an integer representing the parent vertex to avoid revisiting), and `path` (a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal). The function performs a depth-first search and returns the current path `path` if no further recursion is needed. If a recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)` is made, it returns the result of that call, which could be a non-empty list containing elements including `node_v` or simply the result of the recursive call stored in `res`. If no valid path is found, it returns an empty list.**
