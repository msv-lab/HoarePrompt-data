You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Implementation Missing**: The code references a `DSU` class, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This class is essential for the union-find operations required to detect cycles in the graph.

2. **DFS Implementation Issues**: The `dfs` function is supposed to find a cycle starting from a given node, but it does not correctly handle the backtracking and cycle detection logic. Specifically, the `path` is not correctly managed and the cycle detection logic can fail in certain scenarios.

3. **Edge Handling**: The code sorts edges in descending order, which is not necessary for finding the cycle with the minimum weight edge. Instead, it should process edges in ascending order to ensure that the lightest edge is considered first.

4. **Cycle Detection Logic**: The logic for detecting a cycle and finding the correct cycle with the minimum weight edge is flawed. The code does not correctly identify the cycle after detecting a repeated node in the DFS traversal.

5. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using a dictionary of lists, but the `dfs` function does not correctly use this representation to find cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys
import threading

class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n
        self.min_edge = [float('inf')] * n

    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v, w):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.min_edge[root_u] = min(self.min_edge[root_u], w)
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
                self.min_edge[root_v] = min(self.min_edge[root_v], w)
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1
                self.min_edge[root_u] = min(self.min_edge[root_u], w)

def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())

def func_6():
    (n, m) = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        (u, v, w) = func_3()
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
        edges.append((w, u, v))
    edges.sort()

    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        if dsu.find(u) != dsu.find(v):
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        else:
            min_weight = w
            cycle = find_cycle(graph, u, v)
            print(min_weight, len(cycle))
            print(*cycle)
            return

def find_cycle(graph, start, end):
    visited = set()
    path = []
    def dfs(node, parent):
        if node in visited:
            return path[path.index(node):]
        visited.add(node)
        path.append(node)
        for nei, _ in graph[node]:
            if nei != parent:
                cycle = dfs(nei, node)
                if cycle:
                    return cycle
        path.pop()
        return []

    return dfs(start, -1)

def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()

threading.Thread(target=func_7).start()
```

This corrected version includes a proper `DSU` class, sorts edges in ascending order, and correctly finds the cycle with the minimum weight edge. It also includes a `find_cycle` function that performs a DFS to detect and return the cycle.
