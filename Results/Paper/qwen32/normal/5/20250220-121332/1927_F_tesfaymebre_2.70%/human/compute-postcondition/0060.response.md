To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state described:

1. **_min_edge**: This variable holds the minimum edge weight found in the graph. Since the exact weights of the edges are not provided, we can only describe it as the minimum edge weight in the graph.

2. **len(res)**: The variable `res` is a list of all nodes in the graph starting from `node_u`. Since the exact nodes in the graph are not provided, we can only describe `len(res)` as the number of nodes in the list `res`.

Given these descriptions, the print statement will output the minimum edge weight followed by the number of nodes in the list `res`.

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight in the graph and len(res) is the number of nodes in the list `res`)**
