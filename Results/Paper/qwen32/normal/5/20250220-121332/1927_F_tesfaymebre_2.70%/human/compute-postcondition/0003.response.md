The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. Since the loop uses `test_cases` in the `range` function, it implies that `test_cases` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be at least 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1**
