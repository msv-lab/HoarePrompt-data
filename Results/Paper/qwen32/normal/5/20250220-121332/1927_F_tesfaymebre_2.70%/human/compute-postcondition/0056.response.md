Postcondition: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-2` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the next tuple in `edges`; `dsu` is a DSU object with an updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the current iteration; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight found so far, and `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge` if `_min_edge` was updated in the current iteration, otherwise, they remain as they were before the iteration. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` and `node_u` and `node_v` are updated if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`. If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root parents of `u` and `v` as found by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` after the current iteration.**
