Given the initial state:

- `graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times.
- `edges` is an empty list, as all edges have been processed.
- `dsu` is a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) object with an internal state reflecting the union of all sets containing the nodes, indicating a single connected component.
- `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight found in the graph.
- `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge`.
- `colors` is a list of `n + 1` elements, where the elements corresponding to the visited nodes are `1` and the rest are `0`.
- `res` is a list of all nodes in the graph starting from `node_u`.

The `print(*res)` statement will print all the elements of the `res` list, which contains all the nodes in the graph starting from `node_u`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact nodes in the graph or the value of `node_u`, we cannot provide the exact numerical values of the nodes. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `res` list contains all the nodes in a connected component starting from `node_u`, and the graph is fully connected as per the DSU object state.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of node identifiers starting from `node_u` and including all nodes in the graph.

Output: **node_u, node_v, ... (where node_u is the starting node and the sequence includes all nodes in the graph)**
