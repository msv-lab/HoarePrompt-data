Functionality: **The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from the current vertex `curr`. It avoids revisiting the `parent` vertex and tracks the current path in `path`. The function returns the path if it reaches a vertex with a specific color, or if it finds a path containing `node_v` through recursive calls. If no such path is found, it returns an empty list.**
