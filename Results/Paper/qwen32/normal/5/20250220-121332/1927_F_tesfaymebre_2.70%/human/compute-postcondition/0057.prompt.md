Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight; `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements; `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`; `node_u` is `-1`; `node_v` is `-1`.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively. Otherwise, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, then the sets containing `u` and `v` are merged in `dsu`, `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')`, and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of the merged set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times. `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, otherwise `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`, `_min_edge` is updated to the weight of the edge between `u` and `v`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent pointers after the union.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-2` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the next tuple in `edges`; `dsu` is a DSU object with an updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the current iteration; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight found so far, and `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes corresponding to `_min_edge` if `_min_edge` was updated in the current iteration, otherwise, they remain as they were before the iteration. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` and `node_u` and `node_v` are updated if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`. If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root parents of `u` and `v` as found by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` after the current iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
