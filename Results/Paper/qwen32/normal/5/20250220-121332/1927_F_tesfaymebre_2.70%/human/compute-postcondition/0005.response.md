The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` was greater than 1, so we need to decrement it by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
