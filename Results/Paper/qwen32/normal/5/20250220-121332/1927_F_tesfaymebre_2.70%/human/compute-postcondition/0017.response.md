Postcondition: **`res` is the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `curr` is an integer, `parent` is an integer, `path` is a list of integers, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` is a list with at least one element, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[curr]`, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the program returns `res`. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues with the next statements.**
