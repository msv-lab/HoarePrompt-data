Postcondition: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is `-1`, `node_v` is `-1`, `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)`, `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)`, and `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`**
