The code snippet `node_u = u` assigns the value of `u` to the variable `node_u`. This change affects only the variable `node_u`, and all other variables retain their previous values and states.

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent pointers after the union; `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; `node_u` is `u`; `node_v` is set to `v` respectively if `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v`, otherwise it remains `-1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `node_u` now holds the value of `u`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
