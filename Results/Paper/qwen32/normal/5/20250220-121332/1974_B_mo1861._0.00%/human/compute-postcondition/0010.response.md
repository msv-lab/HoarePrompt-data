In the given for loop, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `b`. The only variable in the loop head is `c`, and the loop will execute for each character in `b`. 

The state before the loop starts includes `char_map` and `s`. However, according to the task, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head. Since the only object in the loop head is `c`, and `c` is simply an iteration variable that takes on the value of each character in `b` during each iteration, we cannot directly adjust `c`. Instead, we need to ensure that `b` contains at least one character to make the loop execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `b` is a string with at least one character.

State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is a key, and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted set of `b`; `s` is an empty string; `b` must be a string with at least one character**
