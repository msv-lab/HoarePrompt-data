The provided code snippet is only a function definition and a docstring, and it does not contain any executable code that would change the initial state. The function `func_1` is expected to decode a string `b` but the actual implementation details are missing. Therefore, no changes are made to the initial state.

Output State: **b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case provides a string `b` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The sum of the lengths of all strings `b` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
