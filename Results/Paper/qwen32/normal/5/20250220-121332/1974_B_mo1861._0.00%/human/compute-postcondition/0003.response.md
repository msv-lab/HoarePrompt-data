The code snippet assigns a value to `char_map[c]` based on the length of the string `b` and an index `i`. Given that `char_map` is initially an empty dictionary, after executing the code, `char_map` will have a new key-value pair. The key is `c`, and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. This means the value is a character in the alphabet, determined by the position calculated from the length of `b` and the index `i`.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of at least one lowercase Latin letter, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.**
