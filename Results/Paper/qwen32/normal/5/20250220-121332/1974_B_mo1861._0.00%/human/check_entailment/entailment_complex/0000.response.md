Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to decode a string `b` that has been encoded according to a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a mapping from each unique character in `b` to its symmetric character in the alphabetically sorted set of unique characters from `b`. The decoding process reverses this mapping.

However, there is a critical flaw in the provided code. The code incorrectly calculates the symmetric character for each unique character in `b`. Specifically, the line:

```python
char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
```

is incorrect. This line attempts to map each character to a character in the range 'a' to 'z' based on the length of `b`, which is incorrect. Instead, the symmetric character should be determined based on the length of the set of unique characters in `b`, not the length of `b` itself.

The correct mapping should be:

```python
unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
char_map = {c: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i, c in enumerate(unique_chars)}
```

This line correctly maps each unique character `c` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters from `b`.

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
