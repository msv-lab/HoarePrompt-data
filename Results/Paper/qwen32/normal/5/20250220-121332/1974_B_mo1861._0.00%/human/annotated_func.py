#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case provides a string `b` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The sum of the lengths of all strings `b` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a corresponding letter from 'a' to 'z', maintaining the original order of characters in `b`. The replacement is based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`, with the smallest character being replaced by 'z', the second smallest by 'y', and so on.
