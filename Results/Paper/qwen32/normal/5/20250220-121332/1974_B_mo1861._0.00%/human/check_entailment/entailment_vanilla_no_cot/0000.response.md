Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the string `b` to get the original string `s`. The main issue lies in the construction of the `char_map` dictionary. The program maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in the reverse order of the alphabet, which is incorrect. Instead, it should map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of `b`.

Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

With this correction, the program will correctly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.
