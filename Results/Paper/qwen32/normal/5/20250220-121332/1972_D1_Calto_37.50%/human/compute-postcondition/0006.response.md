The value of `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `i` is `i + 1` as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**.
