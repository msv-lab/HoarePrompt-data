n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function gcd(a, b) is a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The input consists of multiple test cases, with the first line containing the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each subsequent line contains two integers n and m for each test case. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
