In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m` (exclusive). This means the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1, because the range function `range(1, m)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `m`. If `m` is 1 or less, the range will be empty and the loop will not execute.

The variables `n` and `cnt` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `m`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 1. The value of `i` is determined by the loop itself and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is 0**
