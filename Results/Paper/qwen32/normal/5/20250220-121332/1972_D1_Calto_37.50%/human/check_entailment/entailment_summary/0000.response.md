### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - This function is not directly used in the current implementation of `func_2`, but it is provided as part of the solution, which might be a hint for an alternative or more correct approach.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement.
   - The implementation of `func_2` involves a loop that iterates from 1 to m-1 and calculates `cnt` based on a specific formula.
   - The formula used in `func_2` does not seem to directly relate to the problem statement. It calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then adds `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`.
   - If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated value of `cnt`.

#### Verification:
The provided implementation of `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement. The formula used in `func_2` does not match the conditions given in the problem.

Let's consider a correct approach to solve the problem:
- For each pair (a, b), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- This would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking the condition, which is computationally expensive given the constraints.

However, the provided code does not follow this approach, and the formula used does not seem to be a valid transformation of the problem statement.

#### Conclusion:
Given the provided code and its execution summary, it is clear that the implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
