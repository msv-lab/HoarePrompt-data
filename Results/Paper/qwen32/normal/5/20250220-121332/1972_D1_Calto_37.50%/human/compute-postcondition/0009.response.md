The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `m`, `n`, and implicitly `cnt` since it's modified in the loop body. However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we will focus on `i`, `m`, and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.
- `y` is `i * i`.
- `cnt` is `cnt + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + 1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1` (which is the current value of `i` plus 1).
- `m` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` and `y` are not adjusted here; `cnt` is not adjusted here.** 

However, to make it more precise and clear in terms of the next iteration's starting point:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.**
