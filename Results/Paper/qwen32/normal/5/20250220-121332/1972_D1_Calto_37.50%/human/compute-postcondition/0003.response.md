The given code snippet assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `y`. The values of `n`, `m`, `cnt`, and `x` are not affected by this assignment. The output state should reflect the new value of `y` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is 0; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**
