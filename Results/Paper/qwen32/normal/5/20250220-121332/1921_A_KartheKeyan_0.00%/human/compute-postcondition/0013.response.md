The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Therefore, the length of `coord` increases by one. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new state of `coord` will be the original list with the new tuple appended to it.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input.**
