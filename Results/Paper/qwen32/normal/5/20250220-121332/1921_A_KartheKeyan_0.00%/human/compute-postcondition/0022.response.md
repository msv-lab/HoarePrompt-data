The code snippet `coord = []` sets the `coord` variable to an empty list. This means the previous sorted list of coordinates is no longer stored in `coord`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `coord` is [], `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `i` is 3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**.

In natural language: The variable `coord` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their previous values.
