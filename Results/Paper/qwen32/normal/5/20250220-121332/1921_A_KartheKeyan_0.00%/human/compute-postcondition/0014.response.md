Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `coord` will contain four tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` obtained from four separate inputs. The variable `res` remains 0, and the loop index `i` will have reached its final value of 3. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the last input.
