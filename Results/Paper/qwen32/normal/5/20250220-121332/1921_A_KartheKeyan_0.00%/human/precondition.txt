test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 \le t \le 100.
