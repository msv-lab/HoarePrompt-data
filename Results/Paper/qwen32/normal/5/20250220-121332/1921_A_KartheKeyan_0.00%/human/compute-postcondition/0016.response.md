Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `p1` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the first two points in the sorted list `coord`. The other variables remain unchanged.
