The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are already assigned values from the last input, but these values are overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `coord` is [], `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**.
