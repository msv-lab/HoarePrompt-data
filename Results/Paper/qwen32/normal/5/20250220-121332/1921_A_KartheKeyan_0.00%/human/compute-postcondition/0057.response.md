To determine what will be printed, we need to break down the given initial state and the calculations involved in the `res` variable.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `n` is greater than 1.
2. `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), (a4, b4)]`.
3. `res` is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
4. `i` is 4.
5. `x` and `y` are the two integers from the last input.
6. `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
7. `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

### Calculation Breakdown:
1. **p1 Calculation:**
   - `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinate of the second tuple and the x-coordinate of the first tuple in the `coord` list.
   - `p1 = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]`

2. **p2 Calculation:**
   - `p2` is the difference between the x-coordinate of the fourth tuple and the x-coordinate of the third tuple in the `coord` list.
   - `p2 = coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`

3. **res Calculation:**
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`
   - Since `p1` and `p2` are differences of x-coordinates, they are non-negative. Therefore, `abs` is not necessary in this context, but it is used in the given formula.

### Output:
The `print(res)` statement will output the calculated value of `res` based on the differences in the x-coordinates of the tuples in the `coord` list.

**Output:**
Output: **abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))**
