The code modifies the value of `start_year`. Given that `start_year` is initially 0, the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` simplifies to `nums[x]` because `start_year // nums[x]` will be 0 for any positive `nums[x]`. Therefore, `start_year` becomes `nums[x]`. The values of `t`, `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`, `start_year` is `nums[x]`**.
