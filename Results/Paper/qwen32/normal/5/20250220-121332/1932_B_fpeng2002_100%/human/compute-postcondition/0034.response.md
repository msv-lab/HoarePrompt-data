Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `nums[0]`, `x` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is recalculated to be `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given `start_year` is initially 0 and `x` is 0, this simplifies to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which is `1 * nums[0]` or simply `nums[0]`. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.
