The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range parameters `0` and `len(nums)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the range function will produce at least one value for `x` to make the loop execute. This means `len(nums)` must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces. For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one integer.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0**
