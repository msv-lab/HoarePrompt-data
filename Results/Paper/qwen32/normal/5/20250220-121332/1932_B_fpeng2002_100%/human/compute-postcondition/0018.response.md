The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`. The variables `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new list `nums` and the unchanged values of `num_tests` and `n`.

Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.**
