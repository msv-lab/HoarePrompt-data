The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the loop statement `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`, the loop variable `i` starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1 (the loop will not execute if `i` becomes 0).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value greater than 1, and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and `m` remains unchanged.

Let's consider the state at the end of the previous iteration where `i` is some value `k` (where `2 <= k <= m - 1`). For the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `2 <= k <= m - 1`**

However, to provide a more concrete example, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` is 5. Then for the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2**
