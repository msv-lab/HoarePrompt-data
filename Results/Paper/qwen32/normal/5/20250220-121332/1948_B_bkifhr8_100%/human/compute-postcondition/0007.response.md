The code snippet takes the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, converts it to a string, then to a list of its individual digits, and finally concatenates the current element `arr[i]` to this list. The variable `nums` is updated with this new list.

Given the initial state, the value of `nums` will be the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is True, and the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
