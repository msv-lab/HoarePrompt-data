To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the context and the variables involved.

Here's the breakdown of the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `n`: Initially an integer greater than 0, but it is now `n-1`. This means `n` is the length of the list `a` minus one.
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.
   - `m`: An integer greater than or equal to 2. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `arr`: A list of integers where `arr[i-1]` is updated based on loop conditions. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `i`: An integer initialized to 0. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `ans`: A boolean value that is True if all `nums` were sorted; otherwise, False. This variable is used in the `print` statement.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
   ```
   This statement uses a list `['NO', 'YES']` and accesses an element based on the value of `ans`. If `ans` is `True`, it will print `'YES'`. If `ans` is `False`, it will print `'NO'`.

3. **Determining the output:**
   - The output depends on the value of `ans`.
   - If `ans` is `True`, the print statement will output `'YES'`.
   - If `ans` is `False`, the print statement will output `'NO'`.

Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output based on the possible values of `ans`.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where 'YES' is printed if ans is True, and 'NO' is printed if ans is False)**

However, following the format you provided, we can simplify this to:

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans]**
