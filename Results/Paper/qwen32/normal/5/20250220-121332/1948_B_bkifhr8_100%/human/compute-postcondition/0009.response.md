Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is False, and the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `nums` is not equal to the sorted version of `nums`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
