The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` starts at `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `m - 3`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `i` is `m - 3`.**
