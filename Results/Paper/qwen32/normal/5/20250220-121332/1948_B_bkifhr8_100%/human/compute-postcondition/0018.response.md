Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 3]` followed by `arr[m - 2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.**
