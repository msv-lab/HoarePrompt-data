The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variables `t` and `a` are not in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99**
