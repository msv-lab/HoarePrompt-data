To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the variables involved.

The loop iterates from `m-1` down to `1`. For each iteration `i`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`. If this condition is true, it constructs a new list `nums` that contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. It then checks if `nums` is sorted. If `nums` is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. If `nums` is sorted, it updates `arr[i-1]` to `nums[0]`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches `1`.
- If at any point `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]` and `nums` is not sorted, `ans` will be set to `False` and the loop will terminate early.
- If `nums` is sorted, `arr[i-1]` will be updated, and the loop will continue to the next iteration.

### Final Output State Analysis:
1. **Loop Completion**: The loop will run from `m-1` down to `1`. If `ans` remains `True` after all iterations, it means that for every `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, the list `nums` was sorted, and `arr[i-1]` was updated accordingly.

2. **Values of Variables**:
   - `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `i` are not modified within the loop body and remain the same as in the initial state.
   - `arr` will have its elements updated based on the conditions described.
   - `ans` will be `True` if the list `nums` was sorted for every `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`. Otherwise, `ans` will be `False` if any `nums` was not sorted.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `arr` will have its elements updated based on the loop conditions.
- `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.
- `ans` will be `True` if all `nums` were sorted; otherwise, `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[i-1]` is updated based on the loop conditions, `i` is 0, and `ans` is True if all `nums` were sorted; otherwise, False.**
