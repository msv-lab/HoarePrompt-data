To determine the state needed for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters `m - 1`, `0`, and `-1`.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute as long as the range `(m - 1, 0, -1)` is valid. The range function in Python generates numbers starting from the first argument down to the second argument (exclusive) with a step defined by the third argument. 

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `m - 1` should be greater than `0` (since the range is exclusive of the stop value).
- The step `-1` indicates that the loop will decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1` (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `m` is the integer read from the input.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `i` is 1 (this is the initial value of `i` before the loop starts, but it will be overwritten by the loop).
- `ans` is True (irrelevant to the loop execution).

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need `m - 1` to be greater than `0`. Therefore, `m` must be at least `2`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is at least `2`. The value of `i` is set by the loop and does not need adjustment before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True**
