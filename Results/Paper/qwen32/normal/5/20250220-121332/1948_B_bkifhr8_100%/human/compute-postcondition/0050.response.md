The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `m - 1`, `0`, and `-1`. Since the loop is iterating from `m - 1` down to `1` with a step of `-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be decremented by `1` to become `1`.

Here's the state at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1**.
