The code snippet provided is:
```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```
This line of code takes the integer at `arr[i - 1]`, converts it to a string, then iterates over each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and creates a list from these integers. It then appends the integer at `arr[i]` to this list.

Let's break down the changes to the variables:
- `nums` is updated to be a list where the first part is the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`) are not directly modified by this line of code, so they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[0]` updated to `nums[0]`, `i` is `m-2`, and `ans` is False if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. `nums` is a list where the first part is the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**
