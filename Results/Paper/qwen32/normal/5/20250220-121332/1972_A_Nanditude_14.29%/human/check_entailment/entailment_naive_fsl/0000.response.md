Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

1. **Logic Error**:
   - The code attempts to insert elements from `b` into `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`, but it does not sort `a` after inserting `b[j]` and it incorrectly assumes that the problem with the highest difficulty will be at the end after insertion. This is not the case as the problem requires sorting `a` in non-decreasing order after each insertion.
   - The code also incorrectly handles the removal of the highest difficulty problem and the insertion of a new problem. It should be removing the last element after sorting, not just popping the last element and inserting `b[j]` at position `i`.

2. **Example Where the Program Fails**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3
     1 3 5
     2 4 6
     ```
   - The correct approach would be to:
     - Compare `a[0]` (1) with `b[0]` (2). Since `a[0]` is less, no insertion is needed.
     - Compare `a[1]` (3) with `b[1]` (4). Since `a[1]` is less, no insertion is needed.
     - Compare `a[2]` (5) with `b[2]` (6). Since `a[2]` is less, no insertion is needed.
     - However, since `a[0]` (1) is less than `b[0]` (2), we should insert 2 into `a` and sort `a` to get `[1, 2, 3, 5]` and remove the last element to get `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Then, compare `a[2]` (3) with `b[2]` (6). Since `a[2]` is less than `b[2]` (6), we should insert 6 into `a` and sort `a` to get `[1, 2, 3, 6]` and remove the last element to get `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - The correct number of insertions is 2.
   - The code does not handle this correctly and will likely output an incorrect result.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach should involve maintaining a sorted list `a` and inserting elements from `b` into `a` whenever necessary, ensuring that `a` is always sorted after each insertion and the highest difficulty problem is removed.

Since the code does not correctly implement the required logic, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and fails for at least one potential case. Therefore, the correctness is False.
