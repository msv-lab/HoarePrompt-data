Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, and `results` is ['NO']. The character at index `j` in `row1` is not '>'. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and the character at index `j` in `row2` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` is False.**
