To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior step-by-step based on the given initial state and the loop's conditions.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 1
- `test_cases` is `[(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")]`
- `n` is 2
- `row1` is "<>"
- `row2` is "<>"
- `reachable_first_row` is True
- `reachable_second_row` is False
- `results` is `['NO']`

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs for `n` iterations, where `n` is 2. Therefore, the loop will run 2 times.

#### Iteration 1 (j = 0):
- `reachable_first_row` is True.
- `row1[0]` is "<", so `reachable_first_row` becomes False.
- Since `reachable_first_row` became False, the condition `if reachable_first_row` is not met, and `reachable_second_row` remains False.
- `reachable_second_row` remains False because the condition `if reachable_second_row` is not met.

State after Iteration 1:
- `reachable_first_row` is False
- `reachable_second_row` is False

#### Iteration 2 (j = 1):
- `reachable_first_row` is False.
- Since `reachable_first_row` is False, the condition `if reachable_first_row` is not met, and neither `reachable_first_row` nor `reachable_second_row` changes.
- `reachable_second_row` remains False because the condition `if reachable_second_row` is not met.

State after Iteration 2:
- `reachable_first_row` is False
- `reachable_second_row` is False

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all 2 iterations, the final state is:

Output State: **t is 1, test_cases is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], n is 2, row1 is "<>", row2 is "<>", reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is False, and results is ['NO'].**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False, and all other variables retain their initial values.
