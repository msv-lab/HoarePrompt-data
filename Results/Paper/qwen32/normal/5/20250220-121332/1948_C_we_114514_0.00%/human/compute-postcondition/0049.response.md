To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial state and the provided outputs after the first three iterations.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 1
- `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")]
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is 2
- `row1` is "<>"
- `row2` is "<>"
- `reachable_first_row` is True
- `reachable_second_row` is False

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs for `n` iterations (2 iterations in this case). Let's analyze each iteration:

#### First Iteration (j = 0):
- `reachable_first_row` is True.
- `row1[0]` is '<', so `reachable_first_row` becomes False.
- `row2[0]` is '<', so `reachable_second_row` remains False.
- **After First Iteration**: `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False.

#### Second Iteration (j = 1):
- `reachable_first_row` is False, so the first `if` block is skipped.
- `reachable_second_row` is False, so the second `if` block is skipped.
- **After Second Iteration**: `reachable_first_row` remains False, `reachable_second_row` remains False.

### Final Output State:
- `t` is 1 (unchanged)
- `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], (unchanged)
- `results` is an empty list (unchanged)
- `n` is 2 (unchanged)
- `row1` is "<>" (unchanged)
- `row2` is "<>" (unchanged)
- `reachable_first_row` is False (changed from True to False)
- `reachable_second_row` is False (changed from True to False in the first iteration and remained False)

### Output State:
Output State: **t is 1, test_cases is [(2, "<>", "<>")], results is an empty list, n is 2, row1 is "<>", row2 is "<>", reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is False.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are both False, while all other variables remain unchanged.
