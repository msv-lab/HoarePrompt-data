Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True if `j` was less than `n - 1` and `row1[j]` was not '>' and `row2[j]` was not '>', or if `j` equals `n - 1`; otherwise, `reachable_first_row` is False. `reachable_second_row` remains True.**
