Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `j` is 3. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions provided.**
