The code snippet `reachable_second_row = True` sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `row2[j]` is '>', `results` is ['NO']. The current value of `j` is `n - 1`, which is 1.**
