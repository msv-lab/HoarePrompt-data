The code snippet provided sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True**.

In simple terms: The value of `reachable_second_row` is explicitly set to `True`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
