Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.**
