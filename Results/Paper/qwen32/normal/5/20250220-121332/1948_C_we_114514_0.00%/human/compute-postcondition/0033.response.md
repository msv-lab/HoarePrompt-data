The code snippet provided sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This change affects only the variable `reachable_second_row`, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` retains its value, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `reachable_second_row` is now `True`. All other variables and conditions remain as they were initially described.
