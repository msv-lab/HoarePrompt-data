Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either `n - 1` or less than `n - 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", and `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j == n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains True. If `j < n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains True if `row1[j]` was '>', otherwise it becomes False. If `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` remains True; otherwise, `reachable_second_row` becomes False.**
