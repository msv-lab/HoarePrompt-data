Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_first_row` has been changed to `False`, while all other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
