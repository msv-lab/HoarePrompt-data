Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn]**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `prefix` list will contain `n+1` elements. The first element is `0`, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point. Specifically, the `i-th` element of `prefix` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) will be the XOR of all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`.
