Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `i` is `n`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 2. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[2]` is [0, 3] if it was initially [0, 2], or [1, 2] if it was initially [1, 1]. Otherwise, the 2-th sublist of `suf` is [1, 2] if it was initially [0, 2] or [1, 1], or [1, 0] if it was initially [0, 0].**
