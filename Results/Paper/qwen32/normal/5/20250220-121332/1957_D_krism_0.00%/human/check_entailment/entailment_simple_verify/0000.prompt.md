You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n and f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z).

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined correctly**: The main logic for solving the problem should be inside `func_1`, but the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the required tuples.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array is correctly computed, but the subsequent logic to count the valid tuples is flawed.

3. **Logic for Counting Tuples**: The logic to count the valid tuples using bit manipulation and prefix/suffix counts is incorrect. The program does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem statement.

4. **Output**: The program prints debug statements (`print` statements) instead of outputting the correct result for each test case.

To illustrate the incorrectness, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
6 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce the correct output due to the flawed logic.

Here's a corrected version of the program that should meet the problem description:

```python
def count_tuples(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] ^ arr[i]
    
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(x, n + 1):
            fx_y = prefix[y] ^ prefix[x - 1]
            for z in range(y, n + 1):
                fy_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[y - 1]
                fx_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[x - 1]
                if fx_y ^ fy_z > fx_z:
                    count += 1
    return count

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = count_tuples(arr)
    print(result)
```

This corrected version uses a straightforward approach to compute the required tuples by iterating through all possible (x, y, z) combinations and checking the condition. While this approach may not be optimized for very large inputs, it correctly implements the problem logic. For the given constraints, a more optimized approach would be necessary, but the core logic should be correct.
