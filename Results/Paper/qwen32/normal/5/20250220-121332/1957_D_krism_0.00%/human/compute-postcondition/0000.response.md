The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a string of dashes. The initial state describes the context of the program, which involves multiple test cases, each with a list of integers, but this context is irrelevant to the specific `print` statement provided.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the structure of the input data for a program, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of integers `n` in each test case, and the list of integers `a`. However, none of these variables are used in the provided `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is straightforward and only outputs the string `'-----------------'`.

Since there are no variables or conditions affecting the output of the `print` statement, the output is simply the string `'-----------------'`.

Output: **-----------------**
