The code snippet `c = prefix[i]` updates the variable `c` to the value of `prefix[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `c` is updated to `prefix[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, with `pre[j]` being `[1, 2]` if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `[2, 1]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, with `suf[j]` being `[1, 1]` for all `j` from 0 to 31, `i` is 3, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[3]`.**
