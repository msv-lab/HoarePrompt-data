The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range `32`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `32`. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by `1`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0, and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 2. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[2][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[2][0]` is incremented by 1.**
