The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the range itself. According to the loop statement, `i` is initialized to `n` and decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1 (since the range is `range(n, 0, -1)`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` should be `n - 2`.

The variables `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `suf`, `cur`, and `j` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0, and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 32**
