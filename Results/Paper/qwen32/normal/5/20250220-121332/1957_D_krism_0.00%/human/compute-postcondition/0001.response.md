Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to be the integer input by the user, while the other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
