The code snippet `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the first element of the `j`-th sublist in the `suf` list by 1. Given that `j` is 1, this means the first element of the second sublist in `suf` will be incremented by 1. 

The initial state of `suf` is described as a list of 32 sublists, where the 0-th sublist is [0, 1] if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise [1, 0]. However, the specific values of the other sublists are not provided, so we can only update the specific sublist that is affected.

The initial state of `suf[1]` is [1, 0] (as per the general description, but the exact value isn't given, so we assume the general form). After the increment, `suf[1]` becomes [2, 0].

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `i`, `cur`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where the 0-th sublist is [0, 1] if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise [1, 0], and the 1-th sublist is [2, 0], `i` is `n`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 1.**
