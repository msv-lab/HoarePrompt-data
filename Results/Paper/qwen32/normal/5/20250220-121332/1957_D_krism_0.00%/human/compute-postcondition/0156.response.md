To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the calculations involved in determining the value of `ans`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], where `v_i` is the `i-th` element of `arr`.
- `pre` is a list of 32 sublists with counts of 0s and 1s for each bit across all `prefix[i]` from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists with counts of 0s and 1s for each bit across all `prefix[i]` from `i = 1` to `i = n` in reverse order.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `cur` is `prefix[0]` (which is 0).
- `j` is 32.
- `y` is `arr[n - 1]`.
- `k` is `arr[n - 1].bit_length() - 1`.
- `c` is `prefix[n]` (which is the XOR of all elements in `arr`).
- `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each `k` corresponding to the bit length of each `arr[i - 1]`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is calculated as the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each `k` corresponding to the bit length of each `arr[i - 1]`. Here's what this means:
- For each bit position `k` (ranging from 0 to 31), we calculate the product of the counts of 0s in the prefix (`pre[k][0]`) and the counts of 0s in the suffix (`suf[k][0]`), and the product of the counts of 1s in the prefix (`pre[k][1]`) and the counts of 1s in the suffix (`suf[k][1]`).
- We sum these products for all bit positions `k` that are relevant to the bit lengths of the elements in `arr`.

### Output:
The value of `ans` is the result of the described summation and will be an integer.

Since the exact values of `pre` and `suf` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for each k corresponding to the bit length of each arr[i - 1])**
