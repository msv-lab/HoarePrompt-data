Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]` for some `j`, otherwise `s` is an empty string; `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was found, otherwise, it remains unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))` followed by `'b'`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 1. If a match was found (`char_count[j] == a[i]`), `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` followed by `'c'` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))` followed by `'b'`, followed by `'c'`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. Now, `char_count[2]` is incremented by 1. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 2. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
