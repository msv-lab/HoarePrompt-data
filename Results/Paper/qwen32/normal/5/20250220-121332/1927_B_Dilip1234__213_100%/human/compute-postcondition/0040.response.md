Postcondition: **`s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', char_count = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], i = i, n = unchanged, char_count[j] equals a[i]`**

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and includes the additional information that `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, which is the condition for entering the if statement.
