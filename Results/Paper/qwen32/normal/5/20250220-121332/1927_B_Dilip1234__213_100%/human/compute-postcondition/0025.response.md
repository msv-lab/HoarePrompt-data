The `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `s`, `char_count`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 2 at index `j`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 0.**
