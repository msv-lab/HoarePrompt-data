The code appends the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 1, the character added to `s` is `chr(1 + ord('a'))`, which is `'b'`. 

The other variables (`char_count`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged in their described states.

Output State: **`s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))` followed by `'b'`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 1.**
