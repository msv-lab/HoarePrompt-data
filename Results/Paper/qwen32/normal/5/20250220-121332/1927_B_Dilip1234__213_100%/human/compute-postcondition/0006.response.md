Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string containing the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers, where `char_count[j]` is now equal to `a[i] + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `char_count[j]` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
