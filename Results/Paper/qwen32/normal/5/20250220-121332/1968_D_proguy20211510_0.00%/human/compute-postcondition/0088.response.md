Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `foundb` is True, `b` has an additional element `maxa` appended to it. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to them, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is set to True and `b` has an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` has an additional element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true after these changes, `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to them, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s`. `s` has an additional element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it.** 

The value of `ps` has been updated to `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
