Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * s[len(pres) - 1]]`; `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list; `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list; if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`; if `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly less than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is equal to `maxb`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. `founds` is `True`. If `foundb` is `True`, then `b` is a list with one additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `s` is a list with one element `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. If `foundb` is `False`, then `b` includes `maxa` as its last element and `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then `foundb` is `False` and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. `founds` is `True` and retains its initial value.**
