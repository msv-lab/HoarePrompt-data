The code calculates the maximum values in the `ptss` and `ptsb` lists and assigns them to `maxs` and `maxb` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.**
