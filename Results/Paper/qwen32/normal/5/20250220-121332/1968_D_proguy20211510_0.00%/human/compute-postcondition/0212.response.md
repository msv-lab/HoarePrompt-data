The code snippet provided appends the element at index `ps - 1` of the list `a` to the list `s`. This affects only the list `s` by adding a new element to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres) + 1` elements if `foundb` and `founds` are True; otherwise, `ptsb` retains its initial length, `founds` is True, `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. The loop or if statement is broken out of if `foundb` and `founds` are True.**
