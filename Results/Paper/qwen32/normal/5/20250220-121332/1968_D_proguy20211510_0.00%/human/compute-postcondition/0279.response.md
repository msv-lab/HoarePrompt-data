The code snippet `b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` appends a new element to the list `b`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Since `b` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `b` will contain one element.

The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by the code snippet. Since `preb` and `ptsb` are dependent on `b`, their states will not be updated in this code snippet. Similarly, `sb` and `maxb` will not be updated as they depend on the cumulative sums of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` (now 0), `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, and the conditions on `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` remain as stated; `b` is a list containing one element `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `True`. Since `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, the condition `(foundb and founds)` is satisfied.**
