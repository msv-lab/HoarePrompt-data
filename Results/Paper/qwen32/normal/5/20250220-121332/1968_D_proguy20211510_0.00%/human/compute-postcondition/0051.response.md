Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `founds` is True and `s` is a list containing `maxa`; otherwise, `founds` is False and `s` is a list containing the value `a[ps - 1]`. `b` contains the value `a[pb - 1]`.**
