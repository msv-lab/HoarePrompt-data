### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and compare it to the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. It also reads the permutation `p` and the score array `a`.

2. **Immediate Decision Based on Maximum Score:**
   - The program first checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are equal to the maximum score in the array `a`. If both are equal to the maximum score, it immediately returns "Draw".
   - If only Bodya's score is the maximum, it returns "Bodya".
   - If only Sasha's score is the maximum, it returns "Sasha".

3. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The program then simulates the game for `k` turns. It keeps track of the scores and positions of both players.
   - If either player reaches a position with the maximum score, they stay there for the remaining turns and their score increases by the maximum score for each remaining turn.
   - If a player does not reach the maximum score position, they move according to the permutation `p`.

4. **Calculating Final Scores:**
   - The program calculates the total scores for Bodya and Sasha by summing up their scores for each turn.
   - It also considers the scenario where a player stays at the maximum score position for the remaining turns after reaching it.

5. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - Finally, it compares the total scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Issues:
- **Handling of Large `k`:** The program simulates the game for `k` turns, which could be up to \(10^9\). This is inefficient and would result in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error for large values of `k`.
- **Cycle Detection:** The program does not handle cycles in the permutation. If the players enter a cycle, the simulation would be incorrect because it does not account for the fact that once a cycle is detected, the scores will repeat every `cycle_length` turns.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where `pb` and `ps` are the same or where the maximum score is not unique.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to inefficiency and lack of cycle detection, which are crucial for handling large `k` and correct simulation of the game.

Correctness: **False**
