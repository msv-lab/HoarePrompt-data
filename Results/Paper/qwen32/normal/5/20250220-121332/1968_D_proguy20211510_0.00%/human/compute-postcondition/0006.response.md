The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list to the variable `p`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
