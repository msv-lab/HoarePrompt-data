The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Here, `rem` is given as `k - (i + 1)`. The lists `ptsb` and `ptss` remain unchanged except for the new element added to `ptsb`. The variable `pres` still must have at least one element, and the value of `rem` is still `k - (i + 1)`.

Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with one additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is an empty list, `pres` must have at least one element, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**.
