The code snippet appends a new element to the list `s`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0
- `pb` is an integer
- `ps` is an integer
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input
- `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `b` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it

The code appends `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`; `b` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it; `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it.**
