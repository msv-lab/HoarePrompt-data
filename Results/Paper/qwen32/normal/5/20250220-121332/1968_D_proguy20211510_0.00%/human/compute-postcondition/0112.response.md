The value of `rem` is calculated as `k - (i + 1)`. The values of `ptsb`, `ptss`, and `pres` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `pres` must have at least one element, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**.
