The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes a series of variables and their relationships, but none of these variables or their values are directly used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Draw'`.

Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Variables and their roles**:
   - `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`: These are integers.
   - `preb`, `pres`: Lists of cumulative sums of `b` and `s` respectively.
   - `sb`, `ss`: Sums of all elements in `b` and `s` respectively.
   - `ptsb`, `ptss`: Lists calculated based on `preb`, `pres`, `b`, `s`, and `k`.
   - `maxs`, `maxb`: Maximum values in `ptss` and `ptsb` respectively.
   - `p`, `a`: Lists of integers read from input.
   - `maxa`: Maximum value in `a`.

2. **Logic based on the initial state**:
   - There is a comparison between `maxs` and `maxb` to determine if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`.
   - However, this comparison is not used in the `print` statement.

3. **The `print` statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('Draw')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state, the output is simply the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
