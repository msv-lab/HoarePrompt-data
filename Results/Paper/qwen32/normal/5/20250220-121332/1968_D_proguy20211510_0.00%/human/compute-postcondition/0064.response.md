Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `foundb` is True, `b` has a new element appended which is `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, and `b` has a new element appended which is `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s` except as described.**
