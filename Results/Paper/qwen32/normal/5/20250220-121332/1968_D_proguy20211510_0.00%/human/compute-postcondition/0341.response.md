Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` and `pres` are empty lists, `sb` and `ss` are 0, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` and `maxb` are undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. `s` now includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to `True`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
