The provided code snippet only defines a constant `MOD` and does not affect any of the other variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the addition of the `MOD` variable.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each element p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `YES` is `'YES'`, `NO` is `'NO'`, `MOD` is 1000000007.**
