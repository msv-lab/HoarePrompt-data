The code snippet provided reads four input values and splits them into four separate variables: `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. None of the existing variables (`ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`) are affected by this input operation. The new variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are assigned the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * s[len(pres) - 1]]`; `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list; `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list; if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`; if `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly less than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is equal to `maxb`; `n` is the first value from the input; `k` is the second value from the input; `pb` is the third value from the input; `ps` is the fourth value from the input.**
