Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, and the conditions on `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` remain as stated. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, then `b` is a list containing one element `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, `s` is a list containing one element `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `b` and `s` remain empty lists, and no other variables are modified.**
