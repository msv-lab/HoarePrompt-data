The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `rem` is `k - 2`, and `preb` and `b` are lists, the new element added to `ptsb` is `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 2 elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `rem` is `k - 2`, `i` is 1**.
