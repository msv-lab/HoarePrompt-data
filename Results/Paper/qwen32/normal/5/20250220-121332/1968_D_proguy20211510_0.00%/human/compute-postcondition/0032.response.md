The code snippet `b.append(maxa)` adds the value of `maxa` to the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `b` will now contain the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` followed by `maxa`. The variable `foundb` remains True, and `founds` remains either True or False as it was before the if statement. The lists `p` and `a` remain unchanged, and `maxa` remains the maximum value in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to `maxa`, then no changes are made to the values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[pb - 1]`. Similarly, if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, it remains `maxa`; if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no changes are made to `a[ps - 1]`. `foundb` is True, and `founds` can be either True or False. If `founds` is True, then `b` is a list containing the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` followed by `maxa`, and `s` is a list containing the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `founds` is False, then `b` is a list containing the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` followed by `maxa`, and `s` is an empty list.**
