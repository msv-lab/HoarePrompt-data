The code snippet splits the input string into four parts and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the `input().split()` function returns a list of strings, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` will be strings after this operation. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and this value is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is a string, `k` is a string, `pb` is a string, `ps` is a string.**
