The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Bodya'. The precondition describes a variety of variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It directly outputs the string 'Bodya' to the console.

Here's the breakdown:

- `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, and `s` are all defined in the initial state, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string 'Bodya' as is.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'Bodya'.

Output: **Bodya**
