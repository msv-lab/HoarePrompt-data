The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given that `i` is `new_i + 1` and `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, the new element can be expressed as `pres[new_i + 1] + (k - (new_i + 1 + 1)) * s[new_i + 1]`, which simplifies to `pres[new_i + 1] + (k - new_i - 2) * s[new_i + 1]`.

The other lists and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with three elements `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `preb[new_i + 1] + rem * b[new_i + 1]`, and `preb[new_i + 1] + (k - new_i - 2) * b[new_i + 1]`; `ptss` is a list with three elements `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `pres[new_i] + rem * s[new_i]`, and `pres[new_i + 1] + (k - new_i - 2) * s[new_i + 1]`; `pres` must have at least `new_i + 2` elements; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`; `i` is `new_i + 1`.**
