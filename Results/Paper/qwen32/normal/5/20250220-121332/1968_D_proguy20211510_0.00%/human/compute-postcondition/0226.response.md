The code appends `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given that `sb` is already `b[i]`, the expression `sb + b[i]` effectively becomes `b[i] + b[i]` or `2 * b[i]`. Therefore, `preb` will now include this new value.

Here are the updated values:
- `preb` will have an additional element `2 * b[i]` appended to it.
- `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is [previous elements of `preb`, `sb + b[i]`, `2 * b[i]`], `pres` is `[s[i]]`, `sb` is `b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`, `s` must be a list with at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is `i + 1`**.
