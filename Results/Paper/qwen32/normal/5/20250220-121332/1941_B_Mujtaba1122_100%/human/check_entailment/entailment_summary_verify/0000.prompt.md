You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a list of integers by modifying its elements based on specific rules. It checks if the list can be transformed into a sequence of 1s followed by 0s. If the transformation is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Implementation of the Operation**:
   - The operation specified in the problem description is:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - However, in the provided code, the operation is incorrectly implemented as:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This does not match the intended operation and will not correctly simulate the described behavior.

2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the logic to make all elements zero. It incorrectly modifies the array elements based on the wrong formula.
   - The logic for checking if all elements are zero is correct (`func_1`), but the main logic for performing the operations is flawed.

3. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     5
     1 3 5 5 2
     ```
   - The correct operations would be:
     - Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - However, the provided code does not perform these operations correctly and will likely output "NO" for this case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the array cannot be made zero, but it also fails to correctly handle cases where it can be made zero due to the incorrect implementation of the operation.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
