Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Here are some critical issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The operation in the code is not correctly implemented. The operation should reduce `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1. However, in the code, it incorrectly multiplies the values by `list[i-1]` which is not aligned with the problem description.

2. **Early Termination**: The code prints "no" and returns as soon as it encounters a non-zero element at `i-1` position after the loop. This is incorrect because the operations might still be applicable to other indices and could potentially make all elements zero.

3. **Checking All Elements**: The function `func_1` checks if all elements are zero, but it is only called after the main loop, which might not have performed enough operations.

4. **Output Handling**: The function `func_2` prints "YES" or "NO" directly, which is not suitable for a function that should return a result for each test case.

Here's a corrected version of the logic that should be implemented:

- Check if the sum of the array elements is divisible by 3. If not, it's impossible to make all elements zero.
- Verify if the array can be reduced to zero by ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements can be adjusted using the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_all_zero(a, n):
    # Sum of all elements must be divisible by 3
    if sum(a) % 3 != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Check if we can make all elements zero
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] -= a[i-1] // 3
        a[i-1] %= 3
    
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        a[i-1] -= a[i] // 3
        a[i] %= 3
    
    return "YES" if all(x == 0 for x in a) else "NO"

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    a = list(map(int, data[index + 1: index + 1 + n]))
    index += 1 + n
    results.append(can_make_all_zero(a, n))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and then tries to adjust the array elements to zero using the allowed operations.
