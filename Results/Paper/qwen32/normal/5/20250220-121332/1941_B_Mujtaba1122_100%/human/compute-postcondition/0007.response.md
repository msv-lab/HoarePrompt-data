The given Python code snippet modifies the `list` by subtracting twice the value of the previous element from the current element, specifically for the index `i`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Without a specific value for `i`, we can only describe the potential effect on the list if `i` were to be a specific index.

Given the initial state, let's assume `i` is a valid index in the range `[1, len(list) - 1]` and analyze the effect on the list for a general `i`.

For `i = 1`:
- `list[1] -= 2 * list[0]`
- `list[1] = 2 - 2 * 1 = 0`

For `i = 2`:
- `list[2] -= 2 * list[1]`
- `list[2] = 0 - 2 * 2 = -4` (if `i` was 1 before this, making `list[1]` zero)

Since `i` is not specified, we can only provide a general output state based on the possible values of `i`.

Output State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1]` is either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `i`, `list[2]` is either 0 or -4 depending on the value of `i`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.**
