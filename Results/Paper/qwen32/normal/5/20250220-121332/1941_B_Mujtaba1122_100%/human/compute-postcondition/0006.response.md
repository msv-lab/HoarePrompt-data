The provided code snippet is `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`. This line of code modifies the value of `list[i + 1]` by subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. 

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 2`, `list[2] = 1`
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`

The code does not specify the value of `i`, so we cannot determine the exact indices being modified without additional context. However, based on the provided initial state, we can analyze the possible changes if `i` were to take specific values.

Let's assume `i` is 1 for demonstration purposes (since `i` must be at least 1 to access `list[i - 1]`):

- If `i = 1`, then `list[i + 1]` is `list[2]` and `list[i - 1]` is `list[0]`.
- The operation becomes `list[2] -= list[0]`, which means `list[2] = list[2] - list[0]`.
- Given `list[2] = 1` and `list[0] = 1`, the operation results in `list[2] = 1 - 1 = 0`.

Since the problem does not specify a particular `i`, we can only infer the change if `i` were 1. If `i` were any other value, the specific indices and values would change accordingly.

However, since the problem asks for a specific output state and the value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the state assuming `i = 1` for demonstration.

Output State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 2`, `list[2] = 0`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.**
