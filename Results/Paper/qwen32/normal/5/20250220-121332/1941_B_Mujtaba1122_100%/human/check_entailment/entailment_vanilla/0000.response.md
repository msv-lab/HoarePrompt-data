Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Given an array `a` of `n` integers, we can perform an operation that selects an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`) and modifies the array as follows:
- `a[i - 1] = a[i - 1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i + 1] = a[i + 1] - 1`

The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by applying the described operation. However, there are issues with the logic and implementation.

#### Issues in `func_2`:
1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The operation in the loop is incorrect. The operation should decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by `1`, `2`, and `1` respectively, but the program incorrectly multiplies these decrements by `list[i - 1]`, which is not the intended operation.
2. **Premature Termination**: The program prints 'no' and returns as soon as it finds `list[i - 1]` is not zero, which is incorrect. It should continue to try other operations.
3. **Final Check**: The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the incorrect operation logic means the array may not be properly reduced to zeros.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
