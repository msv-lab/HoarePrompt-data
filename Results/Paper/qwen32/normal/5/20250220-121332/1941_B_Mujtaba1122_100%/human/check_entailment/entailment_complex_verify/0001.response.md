### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if we can make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation:
- Choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`).
- Perform the operation:
  - `a[i - 1] = a[i - 1] - 1`
  - `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
  - `a[i + 1] = a[i + 1] - 1`

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros.
   - It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
   - **Correctness**: This function works correctly as per its description.

2. **Function `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by applying the described operation.
   - **Logic Issues**:
     - **Incorrect Operation**: The operation inside the while loop is incorrect. The intended operation is to decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by `1`, `2`, and `1` respectively. However, the code incorrectly performs:
       - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
       - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
       - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
       This means the decrements are not consistent with the problem's requirements.
     - **Premature Termination**: The function prints "no" and returns as soon as it finds `list[i - 1]` is not zero after attempting to apply the operation. This is incorrect because it does not allow for further operations on other indices.
     - **Final Check**: The final check using `func_1` is correct, but due to the incorrect operation logic, the array may not be properly reduced to zeros.

#### Annotated Code:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not reflect the actual behavior due to the incorrect operation logic.
- The annotations mention that the state is `[1, 1, ..., 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]`, which is not necessarily true given the incorrect operation logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues described, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
