### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
- The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and modifying the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) as follows:
  - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
  - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
  - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements of the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented for its purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to process the list and determine if it can be transformed to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - The function iterates over the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (inclusive) and attempts to apply the operation while the conditions are met.
   - The operation in the code is incorrectly implemented:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This is not the intended operation as per the problem description. The correct operation should be:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
     - `list[i] -= 2`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
   - The function also includes a print statement that outputs "no" if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the while loop, which is not the correct logic for determining if the entire array can be zeroed out.
   - The function then calls `func_1` to check if the entire array is zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary states that `func_2` checks if the list can be transformed into a sequence of 1s followed by 0s, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement of making all elements zero.
- The summary also mentions that the function prints 'YES' or 'no' based on the transformation, which is partially correct but not entirely aligned with the problem's requirements.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the implementation of the operation is incorrect and that the logic for checking the transformation is flawed.
- The assessment points out that the function does not correctly simulate the described behavior, leading to incorrect outputs.

#### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect implementation of the operation and the flawed logic, the program does not correctly determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
