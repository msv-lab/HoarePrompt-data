You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.

    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])

        else:

    #State: `data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is `0`, `index` is `2 * t + 1` which is `1`, no further `n` or `s` are processed, and all test cases have been evaluated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their orientations ("U" for up, "D" for down). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd, and prints "YES" if it is, otherwise "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
1. There are `n` coins in a circle, each either facing up (`U`) or down (`D`).
2. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
3. In each turn, a player picks a facing-up coin, removes it, and flips the two adjacent coins.
4. If there are only two coins left, removing one doesn't flip the other.
5. If there is only one coin left, no coins are flipped.
6. If there are no facing-up coins, the player loses.
7. Determine if Alice wins if both play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`U`).
2. If the number of `U` coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
3. If the number of `U` coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it counts the number of `U` coins. If this count is odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins); otherwise, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

### Code Snippet
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        count_u = s.count('U')
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Verification
The program correctly implements the logic based on the key observation that the parity of the number of `U` coins determines the winner. Here's why:

1. It reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
2. For each test case, it counts the number of `U` coins.
3. It checks the parity of `count_u`:
   - If `count_u` is odd, it prints "YES" (Alice wins).
   - If `count_u` is even, it prints "NO" (Bob wins).

This aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements and the optimal strategy described.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles every potential case based on the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios that the program fails to address.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of `U` coins, which is the optimal strategy for both players. It handles multiple test cases and provides the correct output for each one.
