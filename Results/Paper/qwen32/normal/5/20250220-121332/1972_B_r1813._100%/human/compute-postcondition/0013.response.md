Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is a positive integer (at least 1), `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is `data[2]`, `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `count_u` is odd, then `count_u` is odd. Otherwise, `count_u` is even.**
