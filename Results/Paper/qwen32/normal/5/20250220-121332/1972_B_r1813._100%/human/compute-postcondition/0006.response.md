The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `s`. Given that `index` is 1, `s` will be assigned the value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is a positive integer (at least 1), `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is `data[2]`.**
