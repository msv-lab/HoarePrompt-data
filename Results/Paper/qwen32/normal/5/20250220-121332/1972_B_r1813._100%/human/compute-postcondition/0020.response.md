The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`data`, `index`, `n`, `s`, `count_u`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
