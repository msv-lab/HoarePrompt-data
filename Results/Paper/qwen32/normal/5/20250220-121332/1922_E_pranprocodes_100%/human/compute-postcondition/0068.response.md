The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999997 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999998 or 99999999 based on the input integer's parity, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the input integer's parity, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `max`] if `x` is even, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd, [-100000000, 100000000, `max`] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, `max`], `i` is incremented by 1. `x` is now `x // 2`.**
