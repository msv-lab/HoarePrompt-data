The value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of its previous value by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even and 99999999 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and -99999999 if `x` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even and [-100000000, 100000000] if `x` was odd, `i` is 1**.
