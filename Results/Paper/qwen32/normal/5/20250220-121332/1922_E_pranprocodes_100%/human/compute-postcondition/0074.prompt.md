Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [], `i` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `x` is the input integer divided by 2 if it is even, otherwise `x` is the input integer minus 1. `x` is not equal to 1 or 0. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 100000000. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000. `ans` is [100000000] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000]. `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `x` is updated based on the input integer's parity: if the input integer was even, `x` is the input integer divided by 4 if it was even, otherwise `x` is (input integer - 1) divided by 2; if the input integer was odd, `x` is `(input integer / 2) - 1` if `input integer` is even, otherwise `x` is `input integer - 2`. `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 based on the input integer's parity. `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the input integer's parity. `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, [100000000, -100000000] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd, [-100000000, 100000000] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999]. `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `x` must not be 1 or 0, `max` is 99999997 if `x` is even after division, otherwise `max` is 99999998 or 99999999 based on the new parity of `x`; `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd after division, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the new parity of `x`; `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `max`] if `x` is even after division, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd after division, [-100000000, 100000000, `max`] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even after division, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, `max`]; `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` was odd, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999 based on the parity of `x` before division, `min` is -99999998 or -100000000 based on the parity of `x` before division, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `min`], [100000000, -100000000, `min`], [-100000000, 100000000, `min`], or [-100000000, -99999999, `min`] based on the parities before and after division.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
