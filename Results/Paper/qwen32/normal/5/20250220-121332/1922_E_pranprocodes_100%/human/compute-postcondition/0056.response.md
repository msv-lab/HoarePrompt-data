The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is not equal to 1 or 0.

Since `x` is not equal to 1 or 0, we need to ensure that `x` remains not equal to 1 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is 1, `x` is the input integer divided by 2 if it is even, otherwise `x` is the input integer minus 1 and `x` is not equal to 1 or 0. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 100000000. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000. `ans` is [100000000] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000]. `i` is incremented by 1**
