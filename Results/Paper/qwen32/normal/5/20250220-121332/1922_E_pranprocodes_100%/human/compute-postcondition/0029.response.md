The code snippet `x = x // 2` will divide the current value of `x` by 2 and update `x` with the result of this integer division.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 2
- `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and is not equal to 1
- If the original `x` is even: `max` is 99999997, `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]`, `min` is 99999999
- If the original `x` is odd: `max` is -100000001, `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`, `min` is -99999998

After executing `x = x // 2`, the value of `x` will be further divided by 2, but the values of `t`, `max`, `ans`, and `min` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is the result of the current `x` divided by 2, `max` is 99999997 if the original `x` was even, otherwise `max` is -100000001; `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]` if the original `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`; `min` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, otherwise `min` is -99999998.**
