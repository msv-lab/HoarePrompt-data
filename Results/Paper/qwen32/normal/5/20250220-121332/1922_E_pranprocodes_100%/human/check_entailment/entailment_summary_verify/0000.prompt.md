You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Example

Input

    4
    
    2
    
    5
    
    13
    
    37

Output

    1
    0
    3
    0 1 0
    5
    2 2 3 4 2
    7
    -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a number of test cases, each consisting of an integer `X`. For each test case, it calculates the number of iterations required to reduce `X` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 if even or subtracting 1 if odd, and generates a sequence of values based on the operations performed. It outputs the number of iterations and the sequence for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences for every potential value of X within the given range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The program attempts to construct the array by appending either the maximum or minimum value based on whether X is even or odd, then adjusting X accordingly. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

### Example Case:
Input:
```
1
5
```

Expected Output:
```
3
0 1 0
```
or any other valid array of length at most 200 with exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

### Program Output:
The program will generate an array based on the logic provided, but it is unlikely to produce an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences. For example, it might produce:
```
2
100000000 99999999
```
which only has 3 increasing subsequences: [], [100000000], [100000000, 99999999].

### General Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Generating Subsequences**: The logic used in the program to generate the array does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will match the given X.
2. **Lack of Verification**: The program does not verify that the generated array has exactly X increasing subsequences.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases or larger values of X correctly.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work for all possible inputs within the specified range, making it incorrect.
