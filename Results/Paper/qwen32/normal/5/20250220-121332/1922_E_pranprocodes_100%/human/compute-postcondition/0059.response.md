Initial State: `t` is 1, `x` is the input integer divided by 2 if it is even, otherwise `x` is the input integer minus 1 and `x` is not equal to 1 or 0, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000], `i` is incremented by 1.

The code `x = x // 2` updates the value of `x` by performing integer division by 2. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is the input integer divided by 4 if it was even, otherwise `x` is (input integer - 1) divided by 2, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000], `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `x` is now half of its previous value, obtained through integer division. All other variables remain unchanged.
