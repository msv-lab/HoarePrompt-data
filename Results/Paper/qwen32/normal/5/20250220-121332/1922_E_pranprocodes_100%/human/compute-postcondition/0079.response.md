The value of `x` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of iterations, `x` is an input integer, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values of `x`, `ans` contains the accumulated `max` and `min` values in reversed order, `i` is `t + 1`.
