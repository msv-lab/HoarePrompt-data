The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `x` is an input integer minus 1 (and `x` must not be 1, meaning `x` was originally an odd number not equal to 1), `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is `t + 1` (which is 1).

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is 1**
