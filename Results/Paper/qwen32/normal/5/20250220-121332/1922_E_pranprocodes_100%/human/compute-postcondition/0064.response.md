Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is updated based on the input integer's parity: if the input integer was even, `x` is the input integer divided by 4 if it was even, otherwise `x` is (input integer - 1) divided by 2; if the input integer was odd, `x` is `(input integer / 2) - 1` if `input integer` is even, otherwise `x` is `input integer - 2`. `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 based on the input integer's parity. `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000 or -99999998 based on the input integer's parity. `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, [100000000, -100000000] if the input integer was even and `x` is odd, [-100000000, 100000000] if the input integer was odd and `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999]. `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
