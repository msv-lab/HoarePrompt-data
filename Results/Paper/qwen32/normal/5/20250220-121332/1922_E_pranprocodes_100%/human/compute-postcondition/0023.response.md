The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation `x -= 1`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` (original) is even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` (original) is odd, `ans` is `[100000000, -99999999]` if `x` (original) is odd, `ans` is `[100000000]` if `x` (original) is even.**
