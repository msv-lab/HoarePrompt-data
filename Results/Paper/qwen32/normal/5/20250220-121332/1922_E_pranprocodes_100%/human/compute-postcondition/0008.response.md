The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will now contain one element, which is `100000000`. The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and the precondition that `x` is an input integer, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is even remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], and `x` is even**.
