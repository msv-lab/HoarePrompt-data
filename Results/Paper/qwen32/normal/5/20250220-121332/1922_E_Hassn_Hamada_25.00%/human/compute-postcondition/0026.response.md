To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the changes observed in the first three iterations.

### Initial State:
- `size` is 9
- `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - 511, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])`

Let's denote `result` as `r` for simplicity.

### Changes After Each Iteration:
1. **After the 1st iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - The element at index `-r - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `r`.
   - This means `sequence[-r - 1] += r`.

2. **After the 2nd iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - The element at index `-r - 2` in `sequence` is incremented by `r`.
   - This means `sequence[-r - 2] += r`.

3. **After the 3rd iteration (`i = 2`)**:
   - The element at index `-r - 3` in `sequence` is incremented by `r`.
   - This means `sequence[-r - 3] += r`.

### General Pattern:
- For each iteration `i`, the element at index `-r - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `r`.

### Observations:
- The loop runs `size` times, which is 9 times in this case.
- `r` (the `result` from `func_1`) is a constant value throughout the loop.
- The indices being modified are `-r - 1`, `-r - 2`, ..., `-r - 9`.

### Final State Calculation:
- The loop will modify the last `size` (9) elements of the `sequence` list.
- Specifically, for `i` ranging from 0 to 8, `sequence[-r - i - 1]` will be incremented by `r`.

Let's denote the elements of `sequence` as `seq[0], seq[1], ..., seq[8]`.

- `seq[-r - 0 - 1] += r` → `seq[-r - 1] += r`
- `seq[-r - 1 - 1] += r` → `seq[-r - 2] += r`
- ...
- `seq[-r - 8 - 1] += r` → `seq[-r - 9] += r`

Since `r` is a constant, each of the last 9 elements of `sequence` will be incremented by `r`.

### Conclusion:
- The final `sequence` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` with the last 9 elements incremented by `r`.
- Since `r` is a constant, and the `sequence` has exactly 9 elements, all elements in `sequence` will be incremented by `r`.

### Final Output State:
- `size` remains 9.
- `sequence` becomes `[r, r+1, r+2, r+3, r+4, r+5, r+6, r+7, r+8]`.
- `result` remains `r`.

Given that we do not have the exact value of `r`, we can describe the final `sequence` in terms of `r`.

Output State: **size is 9, sequence is [r, r+1, r+2, r+3, r+4, r+5, r+6, r+7, r+8], result is r.**

In natural language: The final state is that `size` remains 9, each element in `sequence` is incremented by `result`, and `result` remains unchanged.
