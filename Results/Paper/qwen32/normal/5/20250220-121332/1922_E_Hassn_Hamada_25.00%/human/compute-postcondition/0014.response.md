The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `size` is 9. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 1. The value of `size` remains the same as long as there are more iterations to be executed, which is 9 in this case.

State: **`size` is 9, `i` is 1, `sequence` contains [0]**
