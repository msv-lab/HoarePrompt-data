To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables. The code snippet provided is:

```python
sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```

Given the initial state:
- `size` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

The code modifies the `sequence` list by adding the value of `result` to the element at the index `-result - i - 1`. Since `i` is 0, the index simplifies to `-result - 1`.

The value of `result` is not provided in the initial state, so we will keep it as is. The element at the index `-result - 1` in the `sequence` list is incremented by `result`.

Output State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `-result - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.**
