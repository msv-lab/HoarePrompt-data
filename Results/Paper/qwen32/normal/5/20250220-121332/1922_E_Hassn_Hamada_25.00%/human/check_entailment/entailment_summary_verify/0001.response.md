### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the algorithm and its implementation against the problem requirements. The problem requires generating an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program uses a recursive approach to construct this array based on the binary representation of `X`.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `X` and then calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence by finding the largest `size` such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` (which is `2^(size+1) - 1`) is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It appends integers from `0` to `size-1` to the sequence.
   - It then recursively processes the remaining number by subtracting `(1 << size) - 1` from `number`.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to the last `size` elements of the sequence.

3. **Output**:
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed.
   - The sequence itself is printed as space-separated integers.

#### Key Points to Verify:

- **Binary Representation and Subsequences**:
  - The core idea is that the binary representation of `X` helps in constructing a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
  - The function `func_1` recursively constructs the sequence by breaking down `X` into smaller parts and adjusting the sequence accordingly.

- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  - The relationship between the binary representation of `X` and the number of increasing subsequences is crucial.
  - For a sequence of length `n`, the number of increasing subsequences can be related to the binary representation of `X` by considering the number of ways to choose subsequences.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should handle edge cases such as when `X` is very large (close to `10^18`) or when `X` is a power of 2 minus 1.
  - The program should ensure that the length of the sequence does not exceed 200.

#### Evaluation Against Function Summary:

- The function summary describes the process of generating a sequence based on the binary representation of `X` and recursively adjusting the sequence.
- The summary aligns with the implementation in `func_1`, where the sequence is built by appending and adjusting elements based on the binary representation.

#### Conclusion:

The program's logic is based on a well-defined approach using binary representation and recursion. The function `func_1` correctly constructs the sequence by breaking down `X` and adjusting the sequence elements. The program handles multiple test cases and ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200.

Given the detailed analysis and the alignment between the function summary and the implementation, the program appears to be correct for the given problem constraints.

**Final: True**
