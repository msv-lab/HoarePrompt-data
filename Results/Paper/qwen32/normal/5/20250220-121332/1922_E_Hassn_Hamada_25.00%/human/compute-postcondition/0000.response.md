The provided code snippet does not actually include any Python code to execute. It only provides a function definition with a docstring that describes what the function is supposed to do. Since there is no code to execute, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.**
