Functionality: **The function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by appending and adjusting its values. It returns the size of the generated sequence, which is either 0 if `number` is 0, or a value calculated as `size + result` where `size` is determined by the binary representation of `number` and `result` is the result of a recursive call.**
