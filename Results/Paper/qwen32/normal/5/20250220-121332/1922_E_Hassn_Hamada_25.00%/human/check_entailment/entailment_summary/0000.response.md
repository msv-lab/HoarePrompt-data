### Reasoning:

The problem requires generating an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The provided program uses a recursive approach to generate such an array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, return 0. This means no further elements are needed to form the sequence.
2. **Determine Size**: The program calculates the largest `size` such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` (which is `2^(size+1) - 1`) is less than or equal to `number`. This is essentially finding the highest power of 2 that fits within `number`.
3. **Append Indices**: For the determined `size`, it appends indices from 0 to `size - 1` to the sequence.
4. **Recursive Call**: It then recursively calls `func_1` with `number - (1 << size) + 1` to handle the remaining part of `number`.
5. **Adjust Sequence**: After the recursive call, it adjusts the previously appended values in the sequence based on the result of the recursive call.

The key idea here is to use binary representation to determine the structure of the sequence. The number of increasing subsequences in a sequence like `[0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, ...]` can be calculated based on the binary representation of the input `number`.

However, there are a few points to consider:
- The program does not handle the case where `X` is 1, which is not mentioned in the problem constraints (since `X` is at least 2).
- The program assumes that the input `number` (which is `X - 1`) can always be represented in a way that forms a valid sequence. This seems to be correct based on the problem constraints and the nature of binary representation.

Given the execution summary and the logic of the program, it appears that the program is correctly generating sequences that have the required number of increasing subsequences based on the binary representation of `X - 1`.
