To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop condition involves the variables `number` and `size`. Specifically, it checks if `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `number` must be at least 7.
- `size` is 3.

First, let's calculate the value of `(1 << size + 1) - 1` with `size` being 3:
- `1 << (3 + 1)` is equivalent to `1 << 4`, which is `16`.
- `16 - 1` is `15`.

So the loop condition at this point is `15 <= number`. Since `number` must be at least 7, it is currently satisfying the condition because 7 is less than 15. However, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition is still true after the loop body executes.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that after the loop body executes, `number` is still greater than or equal to `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1`. If we assume the loop body does not change `size` and only changes `number`, we need to ensure that `number` remains at least 15.

Therefore, to make sure the loop can execute one more time, `number` must be adjusted to be at least 15.

State: **`number` must be at least 15, `size` is 3**
