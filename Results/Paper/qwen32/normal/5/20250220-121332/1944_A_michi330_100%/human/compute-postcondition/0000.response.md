The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `k` from the initial state are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is either 3 or 5; `k` is between 0 and \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).** 

However, since `n` and `k` are not modified in the provided code, the specific values of `n` and `k` remain as they were described in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of `t` as an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is either 3 or 5; `k` is between 0 and \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).** 

To clarify, the output state should reflect the fact that `t` has been assigned a value, while `n` and `k` retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is either 3 or 5, `k` is between 0 and \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).**
