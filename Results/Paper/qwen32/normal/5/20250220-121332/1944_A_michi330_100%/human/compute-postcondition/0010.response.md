The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or the initial state described. The value `1` is explicitly provided in the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state mentions several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Given this, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
