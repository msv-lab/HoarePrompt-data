Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The condition `k >= n - 1` is evaluated, but the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
