Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is less than `n - 1`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(n)
```

Since the code only involves printing the variable `n`, and `n` is defined as the first integer from the input, the output will be the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the input)**
