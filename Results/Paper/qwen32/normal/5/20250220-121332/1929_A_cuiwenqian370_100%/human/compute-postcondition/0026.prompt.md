Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input`; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(array)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `index` is `2 + int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1; `index` is `3 + int(data[1]) + n`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being `result` and the second being the newly appended `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is 1; `index` is `4 + int(data[1]) + n + n`; `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being `result`, the second being the newly appended `result`, and the third being the newly appended `result` again; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` and has been updated to the new value returned by `func_1(array)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
