The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, the loop iterates over `results`, and `result` takes on each value in `results` one by one.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` was the output of `func_1(array)` for the current iteration in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element that `result` can take on.

However, since the loop is defined as `for result in results:`, the state of `results` itself does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, as long as `results` already contains the necessary elements. The variable `result` will automatically take on the next value in the `results` list in the next iteration.

Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The state of `result` will naturally be the next element in `results`.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `int(data[0])` must be greater than 0; `t` is 0; `index` is `1 + sum(int(data[i]) for i in range(1, 1 + 3*int(data[0])) if i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1); `results` is a list containing `int(data[0])` elements, each being the output of `func_1(array)` for the corresponding iteration; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the next element in `results`**
