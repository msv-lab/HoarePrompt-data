Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `index` is `2 + int(data[1])`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.

In natural language: The state remains the same except that `result` is now assigned the value returned by `func_1(array)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
