To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement.

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after the array is sorted.
   - The task is to maximize this beauty by rearranging the elements of the array.

2. **Approach:**
   - The program sorts the array and then computes the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences will simply be the differences (no need for the absolute value function after sorting).

3. **Program Implementation:**
   - **func_1(array):**
     - Sorts the array.
     - Computes the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - **func_2():**
     - Reads input values.
     - For each test case, it reads the array, computes its beauty using `func_1`, and stores the result.
     - Finally, it prints the results.

4. **Verification:**
   - The approach is correct because sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
