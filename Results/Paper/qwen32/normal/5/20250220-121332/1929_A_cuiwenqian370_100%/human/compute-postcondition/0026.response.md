Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is 0; `index` is `1 + sum(int(data[i]) for i in range(1, 1 + 3*int(data[0])) if i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1); `results` is a list containing `int(data[0])` elements, each being the output of `func_1(array)` for the corresponding iteration; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `array` variable holds the last list of integers processed by the loop.
- The `data` list remains unchanged.
- The `t` variable is now 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
- The `index` variable points to the position right after the last processed `array`.
- The `results` list contains the output of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The `n` variable holds the length of the last processed `array`.
- The `result` variable holds the output of `func_1(array)` from the last iteration.
