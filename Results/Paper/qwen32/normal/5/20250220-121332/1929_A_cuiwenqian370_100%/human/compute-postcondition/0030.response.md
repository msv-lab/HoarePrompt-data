To determine what is printed by the `print(result)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`data`**: A list of strings where `int(data[0])` must be greater than 0.
2. **`t`**: Initialized to 0.
3. **`index`**: Calculated as `1 + sum(int(data[i]) for i in range(1, 1 + 3*int(data[0])) if i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1)`.
4. **`array`**: A list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
5. **`n`**: An integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`.
6. **`results`**: A list containing `int(data[0])` elements, each being the output of `func_1(array)` for the corresponding iteration.
7. **`result`**: The output of `func_1(array)` for the next iteration in `results`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Calculate `index`**:
   - `index` is determined by the sum of `int(data[i])` for specific indices `i` in the range `[1, 1 + 3*int(data[0])]` where `i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1`.

2. **Determine `n`**:
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.

3. **Form `array`**:
   - `array` is a sublist of `data` starting from `index` and containing `n` elements.

4. **Generate `results`**:
   - `results` is a list of length `int(data[0])` where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to `array` for each iteration.
   - `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` for the next iteration in `results`.

### Output Explanation

Since the exact values of `data`, `index`, `n`, `array`, and the function `func_1` are not specified, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe `result` as the output of `func_1(array)` for the next iteration in `results`.

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **result (where result is the output of `func_1(array)` for the next iteration in `results`)**
