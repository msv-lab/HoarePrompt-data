Let's analyze the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the maximum beauty of an array `a` by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:

1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array. Sorting the array in either ascending or descending order will maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, and these differences will be maximized when the array is sorted.

2. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting. This approach ensures that the differences are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. This matches the problem description which specifies multiple test cases.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements the Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, the beauty will be 0, as the differences between consecutive elements will be 0.
- **Two Elements**: For an array with only two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Largest and Smallest Elements**: The sorting ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at the extremes, maximizing the beauty.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program sorts the array to maximize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, which correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array as per the problem description. It also handles multiple test cases appropriately.
