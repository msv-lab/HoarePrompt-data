The code snippet converts the first element of the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `array` and the remaining elements of `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input`; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.**
