The code snippet provided updates the `array` variable by mapping the elements from the slice `data[index:index + n]` to integers. This means `array` will now contain integers instead of strings, based on the specified slice of `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `t` is 1
- `index` is `4 + int(data[1]) + n`
- `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being `result` and the second being the newly appended `result`
- `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`
- `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`

The line `array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` will change the `array` to contain integers from the specified slice of `data`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is 1; `index` is `4 + int(data[1]) + n`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being `result` and the second being the newly appended `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

In simpler terms, the `array` now consists of integers from the slice `data[index:index + n]`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
