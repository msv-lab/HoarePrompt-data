Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input`; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `results` has been initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
