### Reasoning:

The core of the problem is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The original assessment suggests that sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements will yield the maximum beauty. 

Let's break down the functions and the annotations to verify this:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **Input**: An array of integers.
   - **Process**: The function sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Output**: The beauty of the array.
   - **Annotation**: The annotation correctly states that the array is sorted and the beauty is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input**: Reads from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and the elements of each array.
   - **Process**: For each test case, it reads the number of elements and the elements themselves, calls `func_1` to compute the beauty, and stores the result.
   - **Output**: Prints the beauty for each test case.
   - **Annotation**: The annotation correctly describes the state of the program at various points, including the reading of input, the computation of the beauty, and the storage of results.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because, in a sorted array, the smallest element is at the start and the largest is at the end, thus maximizing the absolute differences.
  
- **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This is correct because, in a sorted array, the absolute difference between consecutive elements is simply the difference itself (since the array is in ascending order).

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input, processing each test case, and printing the results.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that sorting the array and calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements yields the maximum beauty. The program logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with this reasoning and correctly implements the solution.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
