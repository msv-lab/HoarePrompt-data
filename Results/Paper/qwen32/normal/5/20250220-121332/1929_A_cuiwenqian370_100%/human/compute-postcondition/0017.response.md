The code snippet provided is `result = func_1(array)`. This line updates the value of the variable `result` by assigning it the output of the function `func_1` when called with `array` as its argument.

Given the initial state, the values of `array`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `result`, which is now assigned the value returned by `func_1(array)`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1; `index` is `3 + int(data[1]) + n`; `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
