The code reads a line of input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This list of strings is then assigned to the variable `data`.

Initial State: `array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`.

After the code execution:
- `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a substring from the input line, split by whitespace.

The values of `array` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `data` is introduced and contains the split input.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input`.**
