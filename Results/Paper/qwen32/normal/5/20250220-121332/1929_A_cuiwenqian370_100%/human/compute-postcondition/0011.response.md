Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `index` is `2 + int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

In natural language: The `results` list now contains one element, which is the value of `result`. All other variables retain their initial values.
