The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0, we need to adjust `t` to be one less than its current value for the next iteration.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1, `index` is `2 + int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted and the loop will execute `t` times, we decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1, `index` is `2 + int(data[1])`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**
