The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers and `input` is the `sys.stdin.read` function. After executing the code, `data` will hold the split input as strings, but `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**
