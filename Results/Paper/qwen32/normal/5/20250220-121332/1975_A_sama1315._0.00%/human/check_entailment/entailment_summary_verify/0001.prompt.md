You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it processes the list using `func_1` and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results, one per line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The key observation is that if the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is non-decreasing and can be placed before the prefix to form a non-decreasing array, then the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it's "No".

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(arr)`**: This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns "Yes". If not, it simply checks if there is any pair of elements where the first is greater than the second (indicating the array is not sorted). If such a pair is found, it returns "No". However, this function does not correctly handle the scenario where the array can be split into two parts and swapped to form a sorted array. It only checks if the array is already sorted or not.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case. It collects the results in a list and prints them.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because `func_1` does not account for the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a sorted order. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient for the problem requirements.

### Example:
Consider the second test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `7 9 2 2 3`
- The correct output is "Yes" because the array can be split into `x=[7, 9]` and `y=[2, 2, 3]`, and swapping them results in `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.
- However, `func_1` will return "No" because the array is not initially sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic to check for the possibility of splitting and swapping the array parts to achieve a sorted order.

**Correctness: False**
