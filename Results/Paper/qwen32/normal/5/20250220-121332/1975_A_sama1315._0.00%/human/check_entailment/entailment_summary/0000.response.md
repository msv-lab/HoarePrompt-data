Reasoning: 
The provided program is designed to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix and then the two parts are swapped. The solution involves two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` is responsible for checking if a given array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by iterating through the array and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next one. If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. However, the implementation of `func_1` has a logical flaw. The function checks if the array is sorted and then checks if there are any elements out of order. The second check is unnecessary and does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation. Specifically, `func_1` does not account for the possibility of the array being sorted after a series of prefix-suffix swaps. For example, in the second test case provided, the array [7, 9, 2, 2, 3] is not sorted, but it can be sorted by performing the allowed operation.

`func_2` reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. Since `func_1` does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Given the logical flaw in `func_1`, the program as a whole does not meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
