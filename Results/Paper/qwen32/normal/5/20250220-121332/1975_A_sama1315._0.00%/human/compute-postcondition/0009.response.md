The given code snippet updates the `arr` variable by mapping a slice of the `data` list starting from `index` to `index + n` into integers. Here's the output state after the code has been executed:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index 2 to `2 + n`, where each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

In simpler terms, `arr` now contains the integers from the `data` list starting from the third element up to `n` elements, while all other variables retain their initial values.
