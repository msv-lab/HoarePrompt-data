### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, then the two parts are swapped.

The given program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr)`: This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element. If such an element exists, it returns 'No'. However, the second part of the return statement `else 'Yes'` is redundant because the first condition already checks if the array is sorted. If the array is not sorted, the function should return 'No' regardless of the second condition.

2. `func_2()`: This function reads input data, processes each test case, and prints the result for each test case by calling `func_1(arr)`.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1(arr)` is intended to check if the array can be sorted by the described operation. However, it incorrectly assumes that if the array is not already sorted, it cannot be sorted by the operation. This is not correct because the operation allows for rearranging the array in a way that might make it sorted, even if it is not initially sorted.

### Example:
For the input `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, the function `func_1(arr)` will return 'No' because the array is not initially sorted. However, as shown in the problem statement, it is possible to sort the array by performing the operation multiple times.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
