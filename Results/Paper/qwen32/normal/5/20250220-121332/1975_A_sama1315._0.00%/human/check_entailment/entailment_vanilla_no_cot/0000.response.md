Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or not, and it does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a sorted order.

To solve the problem, we need to determine if there exists a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped. This means finding a point where the array can be rotated to become sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:
            count += 1
        if count > 1:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

This function counts the number of "drops" (places where the current element is greater than the next element, considering the array circularly). If there is more than one drop, the array cannot be sorted by a single rotation. If there is zero or one drop, the array can be sorted by a rotation.
