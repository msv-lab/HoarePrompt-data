You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers with length n, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in arr is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `1 + t * (n + 1)` to `1 + t * (n + 1) + n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `1 + t * (n + 1) + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)` for all `t` iterations; `n` is the integer value of `data[1 + (t-1) * (n + 1)]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)` for the last iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result_1\nresult_2\n...\nresult_t (where result_i is the value returned by func_1(arr) for the i-th iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers with a length `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in `arr` is a positive integer between 1 and 1,000,000. The function returns the functionality based on the elements of the list, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
