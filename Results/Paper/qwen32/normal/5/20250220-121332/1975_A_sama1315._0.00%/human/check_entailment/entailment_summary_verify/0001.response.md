### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The key observation is that if the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is non-decreasing and can be placed before the prefix to form a non-decreasing array, then the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it's "No".

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(arr)`**: This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns "Yes". If not, it checks if there is any pair of elements where the first is greater than the second (indicating the array is not sorted). If such a pair is found, it returns "No". However, this function does not correctly handle the scenario where the array can be split into two parts and swapped to form a sorted array. It only checks if the array is already sorted or not.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case. It collects the results in a list and prints them.

#### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because `func_1` does not account for the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a sorted order. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient for the problem requirements.

#### Example:
Consider the second test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `7 9 2 2 3`
- The correct output is "Yes" because the array can be split into `x=[7, 9]` and `y=[2, 2, 3]`, and swapping them results in `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.
- However, `func_1` will return "No" because the array is not initially sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic to check for the possibility of splitting and swapping the array parts to achieve a sorted order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.
