### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The key point is that the operation allows us to rotate the array in any way we want.

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(arr)`**: This function checks if the given array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns "Yes", otherwise, it returns "No".
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

However, the logic in `func_1` is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly. The function only checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not consider the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a rotation of the array that results in a non-decreasing order. This can be done by checking if there is a point in the array where the sequence can be split and swapped to form a sorted array.

Here's a correct approach:
- Find the number of places where the array is not in non-decreasing order.
- If there is more than one such place, it is impossible to sort the array with the allowed operation.
- If there is exactly one such place, check if the array can be rotated to form a sorted array.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for these conditions and only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
