The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state. However, the loop depends on the variable `t` to determine how many times it will execute. Since the loop iterates `t` times, we need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1 in that iteration. Therefore, to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1 before the start of the next iteration.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index 2 to `2 + n`, where each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 2; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

Note: The value of `t` is incremented by 1 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
