The provided code snippet is:

```python
n = int(data[index])
```

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index 2 to `2 + n`, where each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `2 + n`.
- `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 2.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `result`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.

The code snippet reassigns the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[index]`.

Since `index` is `2 + n`, the new value of `n` will be `int(data[2 + n])`.

The other variables (`arr`, `data`, `t`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index 2 to `2 + n`, where each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 2; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**.
