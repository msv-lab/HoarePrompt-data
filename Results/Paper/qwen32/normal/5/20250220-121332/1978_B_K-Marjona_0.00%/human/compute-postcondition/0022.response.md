Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and prints a computed value based on these inputs. The computed value is determined by whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a`, using specific arithmetic operations to derive the result.**
