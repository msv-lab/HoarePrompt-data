### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided program to ensure accuracy.

#### Problem Recap

Bob sells `n` buns with a usual price of `a` coins each. He can offer a promotion where the first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` coins for the first bun down to `b - k + 1` coins for the `k`-th bun. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to maximize profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

#### Key Points

1. **Promotion Price Calculation:**
   - For the first `k` buns, the total price is the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) \cdot k / 2\).

2. **Usual Price Calculation:**
   - For the remaining `n - k` buns, the total price is \((n - k) \cdot a\).

3. **Choosing `k`:**
   - `k` should be chosen such that the total price is maximized. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a + 1` because beyond `b - a + 1`, the price of the buns would become less than or equal to `a`, making it better to sell them at the usual price.

#### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Value of `k`:**
   - The original program sets `k = min(n, b - a)`. This is incorrect. The correct value should be `k = min(n, b - a + 1)`. The price of the `k`-th bun is `b - k + 1`, and this should be at least `a` to make the promotion beneficial. Therefore, `k` should be the maximum value such that `b - k + 1 >= a`, which simplifies to `k <= b - a + 1`.

2. **Handling `b <= a`:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b <= a` by printing `a * n`, as selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.

#### Corrected Program

The corrected version of the program should be:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)  # Corrected to b - a + 1
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

#### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the value of `k` should be `min(n, b - a + 1)` instead of `min(n, b - a)`. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect due to this mistake.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
