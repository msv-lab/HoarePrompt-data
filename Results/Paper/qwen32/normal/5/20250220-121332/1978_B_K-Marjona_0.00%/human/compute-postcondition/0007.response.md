Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is less than or equal to `a` and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a` and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**
