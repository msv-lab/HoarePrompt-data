Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` is determined to be the smaller of the two values: `n` and the difference between `b` and `a`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
