To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the expression step by step based on the initial state provided.

### Given:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```
(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Calculate `k`**:
   - `k` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
   - This means \(k = \min(n, b - a)\).

2. **Evaluate the first part of the expression**:
   - \((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k\)
   - Simplify the inner part: \(b + (b - k + 1) = 2b - k + 1\)
   - So the first part becomes: \((2b - k + 1) // 2 * k\)
   - This part calculates the sum of the `k` largest numbers from `b` down to `b - k + 1` and multiplies it by `k`.

3. **Evaluate the second part of the expression**:
   - \((n - k) * a\)
   - This part multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - The final result is the sum of the two parts calculated above.

### Output Description:
- The output is the result of the expression \((2b - k + 1) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a\).
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
- The expression calculates the sum of the `k` largest numbers from `b` down to `b - k + 1` and multiplies it by `k`, then adds the product of `(n - k)` and `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **The result of \((2b - k + 1) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a\) where \(k = \min(n, b - a)\)**
