Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Bob is selling `n` buns. The usual price of each bun is `a` coins. However, he can apply a promotion where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins for the first bun, `b-1` coins for the second bun, and so on until `b-k+1` coins for the `k`-th bun. The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Key Points

1. **Promotion Price Calculation:**
   - For the first `k` buns, the total price can be calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k / 2`.

2. **Usual Price Calculation:**
   - For the remaining `n-k` buns, the total price is `(n - k) * a`.

3. **Choosing `k`:**
   - `k` should be chosen such that the total price is maximized. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a + 1` because beyond `b - a + 1`, the price of the buns would become less than or equal to `a`, and it would be better to sell them at the usual price.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)  # Corrected to b - a + 1
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Value of `k`:**
   - The original program has `k = min(n, b - a)`. This is incorrect because `k` should be `min(n, b - a + 1)`. The price of the `k`-th bun is `b - k + 1`, and this should be at least `a` to make the promotion beneficial. Hence, `k` should be the maximum value such that `b - k + 1 >= a`, which simplifies to `k <= b - a + 1`.

2. **Handling `b <= a`:**
   - The program correctly checks if `b <= a` and prints `a * n` in that case, as selling all buns at the usual price would be optimal.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)  # Corrected to b - a + 1
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

### Conclusion

The program is almost correct, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of `k`. The correct value of `k` should be `min(n, b - a + 1)` instead of `min(n, b - a)`. Given the original program, the correctness is **False** because of this mistake.

Correctness: **False**
