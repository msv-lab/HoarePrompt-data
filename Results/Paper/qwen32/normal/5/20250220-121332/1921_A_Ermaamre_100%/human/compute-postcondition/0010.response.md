To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(dx * dx)`, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This variable `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output of `dx * dx`.

2. **`a`**: A 4xN list of integers. This means `a` is a list containing `N` sublists, and each sublist has 4 integers.

3. **`x`**: A list containing the first element of each of the `N` sublists in the original `a`. Therefore, `x` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer is the first element of the corresponding sublist in `a`.

4. **`dx`**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`. Since `x` is a list of integers, `dx` is calculated as `max(x) - min(x)`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(dx * dx)` will output the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `x`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- **Step 1**: Identify the list `x` which consists of the first elements of each sublist in the 4xN list `a`.
- **Step 2**: Determine the maximum value (`max(x)`) and the minimum value (`min(x)`) in the list `x`.
- **Step 3**: Calculate `dx` as `max(x) - min(x)`.
- **Step 4**: Compute `dx * dx` which is the square of `dx`.

### Final Output:
The output will be the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `x`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list x)**
