### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square. It then calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the sides are parallel to the axes and the area is the same regardless). The area is then calculated as the square of the side length.

Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.

2. **Extracting x-coordinates:**
   - It extracts the x-coordinates from the list of coordinates.

3. **Calculating Side Length:**
   - It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - It calculates the area of the square as the square of the side length.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - It prints the area of the square for each test case.

### Checking the Program with the Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
```
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
- x-coordinates: [1, 4, 1, 4]
- Side length: max(x) - min(x) = 4 - 1 = 3
- Area: 3 * 3 = 9

#### Test Case 2:
```
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```
- x-coordinates: [-1, 1, 1, -1]
- Side length: max(x) - min(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2
- Area: 2 * 2 = 4

#### Test Case 3:
```
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```
- x-coordinates: [45, 45, 17, 17]
- Side length: max(x) - min(x) = 45 - 17 = 28
- Area: 28 * 28 = 784

The program correctly calculates the area of the square for each test case as per the example provided.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the example provided.
