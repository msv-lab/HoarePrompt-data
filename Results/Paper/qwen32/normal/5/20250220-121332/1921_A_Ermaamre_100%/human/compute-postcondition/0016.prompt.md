Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each of the t test cases, there are four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `t` is assigned the value of the integer input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
    x = [p[0] for p in a]
    dx = max(x) - min(x)
    print(dx * dx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a 4xN list of integers; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a new 4xN list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in the original `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `a` is a new 4xN list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
