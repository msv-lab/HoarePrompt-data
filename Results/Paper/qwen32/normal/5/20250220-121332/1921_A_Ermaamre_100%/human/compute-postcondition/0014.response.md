The code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, which contains the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`. The variable `dx` is then assigned this difference. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `a` is a new 4xN list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**
