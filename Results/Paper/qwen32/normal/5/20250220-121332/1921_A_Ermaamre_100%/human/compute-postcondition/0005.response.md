To determine what will be printed by the `print(dx * dx)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **a**: A 4xN list of integers. This means `a` is a list containing N sublists, and each sublist has 4 integers.

3. **x**: A list that contains the first element of each of the N sublists in `a`. Therefore, `x` is a list of N integers where each integer is the first element of one of the sublists in `a`.

4. **dx**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`. This means `dx` is calculated as `max(x) - min(x)`.

The `print(dx * dx)` statement calculates the square of `dx` and prints it.

Let's describe the value of `dx`:
- `max(x)`: The maximum value in the list `x`.
- `min(x)`: The minimum value in the list `x`.
- `dx`: The difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`, i.e., `max(x) - min(x)`.

The final output to be printed is `dx * dx`, which is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the first elements of the sublists in `a`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the first elements of the sublists in `a`)**
