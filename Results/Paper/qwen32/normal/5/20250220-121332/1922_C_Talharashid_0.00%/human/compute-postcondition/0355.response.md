To determine the output of the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the relationships between the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` remains the same (not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 0 (not used in the print statement).
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values `s` calculated in each iteration.
- `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `len(lst) - 1` to 1 and values `s` calculated in each iteration.
- `n` remains the same (not used in the print statement).
- `lst` remains the same (not used in the print statement).
- `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1.
- `inc` is -1 (not used in the print statement).
- `m` must be greater than 0 (not used in the print statement).
- `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1.
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.
- `s` is 0 (not used in the print statement).

### Calculation of `s1` and `s2`:
- If `start` is less than `end`, then:
  - `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`
  - `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`
- If `start` is not less than `end`, then:
  - `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
  - `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

### Determining the Output:
The output of the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will be the minimum of the two values calculated for `s1` and `s2` based on the conditions above.

Given that the exact values of `d1` and `d2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions and the values derived from `d1` and `d2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will print the minimum of the absolute differences calculated based on the values in `d1` and `d2` for the given `start` and `end` indices.

Output: **min(s1, s2) (where s1 and s2 are calculated based on the values in d1 and d2 for the given start and end indices)**
