The code increments the value of `s` by 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is `s + 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end - 1`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))`. Otherwise, `mini` retains its initial value.**
