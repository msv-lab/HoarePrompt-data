Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is len(lst) - 1 (which is at least 1), `inc` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and 11111111, and `start` is 0 or at least 1. Additionally, `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

Explanation: The only change is that `s` has been incremented by 1, so its value is now 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
