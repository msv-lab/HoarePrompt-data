Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, i is equal to t - 1 (indicating all test cases have been processed), d1 and d2 are defaultdicts with default int values populated for all relevant keys, n is an input integer, lst is a list of integers, start and end are the final values read from the input minus 1, inc is -1, m is the total number of iterations for the last test case, s is 0, mini is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, and all queries for all test cases have been processed and their results printed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, all test cases specified by `t` have been processed. For each test case, the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` have been populated with the cumulative sums of distances as calculated. The variables `n`, `lst`, `m`, and the final values of `start` and `end` reflect the last test case processed. The variable `i` has reached `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `s` is reset to 0 after each query is processed, and `mini` holds the minimum absolute difference from the last iteration. All queries for all test cases have been evaluated, and their results have been printed.
