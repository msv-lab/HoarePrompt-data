Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `start` is greater than 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
