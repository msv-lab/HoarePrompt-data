The code snippet only changes the value of the variable `inc` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers read from the input, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. `d2` has been reset to a new defaultdict with default int values.**
