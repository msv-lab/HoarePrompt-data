To determine the output of the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved in determining the values of `s1` and `s2`.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `d1` and `d2` are `defaultdict` objects with default integer values (initially 0).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `lst` is a list of integers.
- `start` and `end` are new values read from the input, each minus 1.
- `inc` is -1.
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `s` is 0.
- If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.
- Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

### Analysis:
- The values of `d1` and `d2` are `defaultdicts` with default integer values (initially 0), so `d1[key]` and `d2[key]` will return 0 if `key` is not explicitly set.
- `start` and `end` are indices derived from the input, adjusted by subtracting 1.
- The values of `s1` and `s2` depend on the relationship between `start` and `end`:
  - If `start < end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at indices `end` and `start`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between the values of `d2` at indices `start` and `end`.
  - If `start >= end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between the values of `d2` at indices `end` and `start`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at indices `start` and `end`.

### Calculation:
Since `d1` and `d2` are initially `defaultdicts` with default integer values (0), the values at any index will be 0 unless explicitly set. Therefore, the absolute differences `s1` and `s2` will be:
- `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`
- `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`

Thus, `min(s1, s2)` will be `min(0, 0) = 0`.

### Output:
Output: **0**
