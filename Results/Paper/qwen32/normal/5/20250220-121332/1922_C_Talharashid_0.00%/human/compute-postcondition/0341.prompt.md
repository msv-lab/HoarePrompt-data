Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` remains unchanged (a new defaultdict with default int values); `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input); `end` is 0; `inc` is now -1; `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is now `end` (len(lst) - 1); `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration; `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` now has a new key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`; `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input); `end` is 0; `inc` is now -1; `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is `len(lst) - 2`; `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start - 1` is greater than -1, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111; `s` is the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `mini` equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is set to 1; otherwise, `s` is set to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and `mini` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` now has a new key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`; `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input); `end` is 0; `inc` is now -1; `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is `len(lst) - 3` and `len(lst) >= 2`; `mini` is `min(11111111, s, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` is `min(11111111, s)`; if `mini` equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1, otherwise `s` is `2 * abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` now has a new key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`; `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input) and `len(lst) > 3`; `end` is 0; `inc` is now -1; `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is `len(lst) - 4`; `s` is the value calculated based on the condition provided.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
