The code snippet `s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `s` is either `0` or `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1])`. After the execution of the code, `s` will be updated to its previous value plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is either `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1])` or `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1]) + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**
