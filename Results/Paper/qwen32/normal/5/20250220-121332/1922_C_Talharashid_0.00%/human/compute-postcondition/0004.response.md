Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
