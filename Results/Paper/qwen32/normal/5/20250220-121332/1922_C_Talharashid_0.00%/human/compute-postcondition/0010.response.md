To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of the variables involved in the loop condition, which in this case is `start` and `end`. The loop condition is `start != end`, so for the loop to execute, `start` and `end` must be different.

Given:
- `start` is initialized to 0.
- `end` is initialized to `len(lst) - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `start` (which is 0) must not be equal to `end` (which is `len(lst) - 1`). This means `len(lst) - 1` must not be equal to 0, implying that the length of `lst` must be greater than 1.

Since `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, we need to ensure that `lst` has more than one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `lst` has at least two elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0**
