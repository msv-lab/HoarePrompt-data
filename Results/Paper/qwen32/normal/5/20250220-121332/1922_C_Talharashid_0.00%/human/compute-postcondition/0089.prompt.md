Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` is the previous value of `s` plus `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + inc])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the smaller of 11111111, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values; `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is `s`; `n` is an input integer; `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element; `start` is `len(lst) - 4`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
