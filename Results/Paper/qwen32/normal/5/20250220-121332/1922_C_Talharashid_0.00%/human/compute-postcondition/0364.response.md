The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` and assigns this value to `s2`. No other variables are modified in the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`, and `start` and `end` are specific indices derived from the input. Therefore, `s2` will hold the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at these indices.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 1, `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `d2` will have keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `n` remains the same, `lst` remains the same, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
