The code snippet provided is `start += inc`. This means that the value of `start` is updated by adding the value of `inc` to it. Given the initial state, `start` is initially `len(lst) - 1` and `inc` is `-1`. Therefore, after executing the code, the new value of `start` will be `len(lst) - 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` is the previous value of `s` plus `abs(lst[start + 1] - lst[start + inc])`.**
