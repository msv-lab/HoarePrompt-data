The code snippet provided initializes a variable `start` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `start` is 0.**
