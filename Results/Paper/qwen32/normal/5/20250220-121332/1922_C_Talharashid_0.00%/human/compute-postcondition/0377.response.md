To determine the output of the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved in determining `s1` and `s2`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`, `n`, `lst`, and `m` remain the same as their initial values.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values `s` calculated in each iteration.
- `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `len(lst) - 1` to 1 and values `s` calculated in each iteration.
- `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 2.
- `inc` is -1.
- `start` is the first integer from the new input minus 2.
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.
- `s` is initialized to 0.
- `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the values in `d1` and `d2` and the values of `start` and `end`.

### Calculation of `s1` and `s2`:
The values of `s1` and `s2` are determined by the following conditions:
- If `start` is less than `end`, then:
  - `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`
  - `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`
- Otherwise:
  - `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
  - `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

### Output Explanation:
The `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will print the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`.

Given the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `d1` and `d2`, `start`, and `end`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **min(s1, s2) (where s1 is abs(d1[end] - d1[start]) if start < end else abs(d2[end] - d2[start]), and s2 is abs(d2[start] - d2[end]) if start < end else abs(d1[start] - d1[end]))**
