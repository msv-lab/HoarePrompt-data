The code snippet provided updates the variable `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Given the initial state, `start` is -1 and `inc` is -1. Therefore, `lst[start]` is `lst[-1]` (the last element of the list) and `lst[start + inc]` is `lst[-2]` (the second-to-last element of the list).

Thus, the value of `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[-1] - lst[-2])`.

The other variables remain unchanged unless `start - 1 > -1`, which is not the case here since `start` is -1. Therefore, `mini` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[0] = s`, `d2[-1] = s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start` is -1, `end` is 1, `inc` is -1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[-1] - lst[-2])`, `mini` remains unchanged.**
