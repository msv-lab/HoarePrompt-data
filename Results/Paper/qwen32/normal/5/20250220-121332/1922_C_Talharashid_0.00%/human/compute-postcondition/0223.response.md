The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the value of `s1` will be the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the initial value of `start` minus 1, `end` is the initial value of `end` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.**
