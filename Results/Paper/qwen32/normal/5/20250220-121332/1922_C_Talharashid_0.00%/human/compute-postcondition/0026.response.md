The code snippet provided is:

```python
mini = 11111111
```

This line of code sets the variable `mini` to the value `11111111`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is now `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end - 1`, `mini` is 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start` is greater than 0, `s` remains as it was calculated before the increment.**
