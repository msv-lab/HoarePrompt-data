Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is the cumulative sum `s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` down to 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the new value read from the input minus 1, `end` is the new value read from the input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the new value read from the input minus 2, `end` is the new value read from the input minus 2, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
