The given code snippet updates the value of `s1` based on the absolute difference between the values in `d2` at indices `end` and `start`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the values read from the input, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start` is not less than `end` otherwise `s1` is 0 and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. `start` is decreased by 1. `end` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, `s1` is now the absolute difference between the values in `d2` at indices `end` and `start`. All other variables retain their previous values.
