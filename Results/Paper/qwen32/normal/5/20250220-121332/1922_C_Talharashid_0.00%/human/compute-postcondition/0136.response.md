To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement: `start != end`.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `start` is 0
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`

The loop will execute if `start` is not equal to `end`. For the first iteration to proceed, `start` and `end` must be different.

Let's analyze the given information:
- `start` is initialized to 0.
- `end` is initialized to `len(lst) - 1`.

For `start` to be different from `end`, `len(lst)` must be greater than 1. If `len(lst)` is 1, then `end` will be 0, and `start` will also be 0, making `start == end`, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(lst)` is greater than 1 to make `start != end`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0.**
