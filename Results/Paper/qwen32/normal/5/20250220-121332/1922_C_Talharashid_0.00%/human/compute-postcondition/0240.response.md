To determine the output of the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved in determining `s1` and `s2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `i` is initialized to `m + 1`.
   - `d1` and `d2` are both `defaultdict` with default integer values.
     - `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`.
     - `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `lst` is a list of integers.
   - `start` and `end` are values read from the input and have been decremented by 1.
   - `inc` is -1.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.
   - Depending on whether `start` is less than `end` or not, `s1` and `s2` are defined as:
     - If `start < end`:
       - `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`
       - `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`
     - Otherwise:
       - `s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
       - `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

2. **Values of `d1` and `d2`:**
   - Since `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1` and `s` is initialized to 0, all values in `d1` from index 0 to `end - 1` are 0.
   - Similarly, `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0, and since `s` is 0, all values in `d2` from index `len(lst) - 1` to 0 are also 0.

3. **Calculation of `s1` and `s2`:**
   - Given that all values in `d1` and `d2` are 0, the absolute differences calculated for `s1` and `s2` will be:
     - If `start < end`:
       - `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`
       - `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`
     - Otherwise:
       - `s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`
       - `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end]) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`

4. **Output:**
   - Since both `s1` and `s2` are 0, the `min(s1, s2)` will be 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
