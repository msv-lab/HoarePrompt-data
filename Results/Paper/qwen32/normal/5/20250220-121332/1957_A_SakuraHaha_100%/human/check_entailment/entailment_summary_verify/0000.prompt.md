You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it calculates how many groups of three sticks can be formed from each unique stick length and sums these values. The result for each test case is printed, representing the total number of groups of three sticks that can be formed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it assumes that any group of three sticks of the same length can form a regular polygon. However, the problem requires the formation of regular polygons with more than two sides (i.e., triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.). A regular polygon must have at least 3 sides, so the program should check for groups of at least 3 sticks of the same length and then determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with these groups.

Here's a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
(We can form one equilateral triangle with three sticks of length 1.)

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```
(The program correctly outputs 1 for this case, but this is not sufficient to prove correctness.)

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
(We can form one square with four sticks of length 2.)

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```
(The program correctly outputs 1 for this case, but this is not sufficient to prove correctness.)

**Input:**
```
1
9
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
(We can form three equilateral triangles with nine sticks of length 3.)

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```
(The program correctly outputs 3 for this case, but this is not sufficient to prove correctness.)

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
(We can form one square with four sticks of length 3.)

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```
(The program correctly outputs 1 for this case, but this is not sufficient to prove correctness.)

**Input:**
```
1
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
(We can form one pentagon with five sticks of length 2 and one square with four sticks of length 4.)

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```
(The program incorrectly outputs 1 for this case because it only considers groups of three sticks and does not attempt to form polygons with more than three sides.)

Thus, the program is incorrect because it fails to account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than three sides.
