The code snippet provided only reads the number of sticks for a single test case. Since the initial state mentions multiple test cases, this code will only process the first integer input, which represents the number of sticks for the first test case. The lengths of the sticks for this test case are not yet read.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For the first test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of sticks. The second line containing the lengths of the sticks for the first test case has not been processed yet.**
