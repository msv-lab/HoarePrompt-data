You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sticks, `a` is the list of stick lengths, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their counts as values.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sticks, `a` is the list of stick lengths, `ans` is the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their counts as values.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for all x in cnt, with x being the counts of unique stick lengths in the list a)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks. Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon. We need to find the maximum number of such polygons for each test case.

### Key Points

1. **Regular Polygons**: A regular polygon has all sides of the same length. The simplest regular polygon is a triangle, which requires at least 3 sticks of the same length.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - The number of test cases, \( t \), can be up to 100.
   - The number of sticks, \( n \), can be up to 100.
   - Each stick length, \( a_i \), is between 1 and 100.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases, \( t \), is read.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of sticks, \( n \), is read.
     - The lengths of the sticks are read into a list, \( a \).

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - A dictionary, `cnt`, is used to count the occurrences of each stick length in the list `a`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons**:
   - For each unique stick length, the program calculates how many triangles (3-sided polygons) can be formed using the sticks of that length.
   - The number of triangles is determined by integer division of the count of each stick length by 3 (`x // 3`).
   - These values are summed to get the total number of polygons (`ans`).

4. **Output**:
   - The result for each test case is printed.

### Issues in the Program

The program only counts the number of triangles (3-sided polygons) that can be formed. However, the problem statement asks for the maximum number of regular polygons of any number of sides, not just triangles. For example, in the fourth test case, a pentagon (5-sided polygon) and a square (4-sided polygon) can be formed, but the program would only count the number of triangles.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it only considers the formation of triangles and does not account for regular polygons with more than 3 sides.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
