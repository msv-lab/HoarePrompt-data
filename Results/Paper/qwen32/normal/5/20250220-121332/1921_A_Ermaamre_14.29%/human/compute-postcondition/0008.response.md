The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` and assigns it to the variable `res`. Given that `y1 < y3`, `res` will be equal to `y3 - y1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `a` is greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x2` and `y2` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x3` and `y3` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x4` and `y4` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, and `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`. Additionally, `y1 < y3`. `res` is equal to `y3 - y1`.**
