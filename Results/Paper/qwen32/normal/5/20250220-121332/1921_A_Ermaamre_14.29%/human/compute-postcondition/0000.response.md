The code snippet provided is `a = int(input())`. This line of code will read an input from the user, convert it to an integer, and assign it to the variable `a`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100 and that there are four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square for each test case. However, the variable `a` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it can be assumed that `a` is being introduced by this input operation.

Since `a` is being assigned a value from the input, the output state will reflect this change. The values of `t` and the coordinates of the corners of the squares remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; For each of the t test cases, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; `a` is an input integer.**
