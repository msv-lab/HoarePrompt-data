Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; For each of the t test cases, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is equal to the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. Otherwise, if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. If neither of the above conditions is met and `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is equal to the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y4` are integers read from the input, `x4` and `y4` represent the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `a` is greater than the current value of `i`. If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. Otherwise, if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, or if `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, and `x4` are integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is greater than `i + 1`. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. Otherwise, if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. If none of these conditions are met, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
