To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the conditions and how `res` is set based on the given initial state and the logic in the code snippet.

Here are the key points from the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y4` are integers read from the input.
- `x4` and `y4` represent the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `a` is greater than the current value of `i`.
- `res` is set based on specific conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, and `y2`.

The conditions for setting `res` are:
1. If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`.
2. Otherwise, if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, or if `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
3. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print(res ** 2)
```

To determine the exact output, we need to consider the possible values of `res` based on the conditions:

1. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y3 - y1)`.
2. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, or `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`.
3. If none of these conditions are met, `res` remains unchanged from its previous value, but the problem does not specify an initial value for `res`, so we can assume it's not set in these cases.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, and `y2`, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `res`. However, we can describe the possible values of `res` based on the conditions.

Let's consider the possible outputs:
- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, `res` is `abs(y3 - y1)`, and `res ** 2` is `(abs(y3 - y1)) ** 2`.
- If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, or `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`, and `res ** 2` is `(abs(y1 - y2)) ** 2`.
- If none of these conditions are met, the value of `res` is not specified, but if we assume it remains unchanged from its previous value (which is not given), we can't provide a specific numerical output.

Given the problem constraints and the need for a precise description, we will consider the first two cases where `res` is set based on the conditions.

Output: **(abs(y3 - y1)) ** 2** or **(abs(y1 - y2)) ** 2** (depending on the conditions involving x1, x2, x3, x4, y1, and y2)**
