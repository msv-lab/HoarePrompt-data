Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `a` is greater than 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, and `x4`, `y4` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, and it is not the case that `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`. Additionally, it is not the case that `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is equal to the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**
