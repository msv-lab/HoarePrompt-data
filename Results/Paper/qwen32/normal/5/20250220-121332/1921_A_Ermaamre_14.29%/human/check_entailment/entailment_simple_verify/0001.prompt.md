You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Input:** 
   - The first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, four lines follow, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of a square.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the area of the square.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The square is aligned with the axes, meaning the sides are either horizontal or vertical.
   - The area of the square can be determined by calculating the distance between two adjacent corners (either horizontally or vertically) and then squaring this distance.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

The program then checks the x-coordinates of the points to determine which points are aligned horizontally and which are aligned vertically. It calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of two points that share the same x-coordinate or the absolute difference in the x-coordinates of two points that share the same y-coordinate.

Finally, it squares the calculated side length to get the area of the square and prints it.

### Correctness:

The logic in the program is correct based on the problem description. The program correctly identifies which points are aligned horizontally and vertically, calculates the side length of the square, and then computes the area. The program handles all possible configurations of the square's corners correctly.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic using the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Points: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
   - The program identifies that (1, 2) and (1, 5) are aligned vertically, and (4, 5) and (4, 2) are aligned vertically.
   - It calculates the side length as `abs(5 - 2) = 3`.
   - The area is `3 ** 2 = 9`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Points: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
   - The program identifies that (-1, 1) and (1, 1) are aligned horizontally, and (-1, -1) and (1, -1) are aligned horizontally.
   - It calculates the side length as `abs(1 - (-1)) = 2`.
   - The area is `2 ** 2 = 4`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Points: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
   - The program identifies that (45, 11) and (45, 39) are aligned vertically, and (17, 11) and (17, 39) are aligned vertically.
   - It calculates the side length as `abs(39 - 11) = 28`.
   - The area is `28 ** 2 = 784`.

Since the program correctly computes the area for the provided examples and follows the correct logic, we can conclude that the program is correct.
