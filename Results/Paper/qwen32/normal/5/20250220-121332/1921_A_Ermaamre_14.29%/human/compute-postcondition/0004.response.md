The code snippet provided reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x3` and `y3`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, there are four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `a` is greater than 0, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers representing user inputs. The code does not affect `t`, the four pairs of coordinates for the square, `a`, `x1`, `y1`, or `x2`, `y2`.

After executing the code, `x3` and `y3` will hold the values of the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `a` must be greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x2` and `y2` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x3` and `y3` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user.**
