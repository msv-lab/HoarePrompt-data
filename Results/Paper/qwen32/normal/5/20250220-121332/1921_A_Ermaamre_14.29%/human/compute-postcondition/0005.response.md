The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x4` and `y4`. The initial state includes the variable `t` which is an integer between 1 and 100, and the coordinates of three corners of a square `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `(x3, y3)`. The code does not affect `t`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, or `x3`, `y3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `a` must be greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x2` and `y2` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x3` and `y3` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x4` and `y4` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user.**
