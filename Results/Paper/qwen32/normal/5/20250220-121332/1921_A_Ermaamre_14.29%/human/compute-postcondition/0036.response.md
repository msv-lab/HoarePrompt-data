Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers read from the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers read from the input, `x4` and `y4` are integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `res` is `abs(y1 - y3)`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `a` must be greater than the current value of `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated to be the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
