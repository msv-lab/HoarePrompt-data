Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is equal to the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. Otherwise, if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. If neither of the above conditions is met and `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is equal to the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**
