The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x4` and `y4`. The values of `t`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `i`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers read from the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is greater than `i + 1`, and `res` is set based on the conditions provided; `x4` and `y4` are integers read from the input.**
