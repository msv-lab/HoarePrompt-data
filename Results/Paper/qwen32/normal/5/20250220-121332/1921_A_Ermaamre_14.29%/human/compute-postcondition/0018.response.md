Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, and `x4`, `y4` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`. If `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is set to `y2 - y1`. Otherwise, `res` is set to `abs(y1 - y2)`.**
