### Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The key steps are:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of the square.
2. **Side Length Calculation**: The program checks the x-coordinates of the corners to determine which pairs form the sides of the square. It then calculates the side length by finding the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the appropriate pairs.
3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated by squaring the side length.
4. **Output**: The program prints the area for each test case.

To verify the correctness, let's analyze the provided example:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - The x-coordinates (1, 4) indicate the sides of the square. The y-coordinates (2, 5) give the side length of 3.
  - Area = 3^2 = 9

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - The x-coordinates (-1, 1) indicate the sides of the square. The y-coordinates (1, -1) give the side length of 2.
  - Area = 2^2 = 4

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - The x-coordinates (45, 17) indicate the sides of the square. The y-coordinates (11, 39) give the side length of 28.
  - Area = 28^2 = 784

The program correctly calculates the side length and area for each test case as shown in the example output. The logic for determining the side length by comparing x-coordinates and calculating the y-coordinate difference is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
