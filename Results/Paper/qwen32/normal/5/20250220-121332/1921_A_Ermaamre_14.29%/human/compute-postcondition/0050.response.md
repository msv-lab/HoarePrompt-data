The code snippet `x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x2` and `y2` respectively. This means the values of `x2` and `y2` will be updated based on the input provided. All other variables (`t`, `x1`, `y1`, `x3`, `y4`, `i`, `a`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers read from the input, `x3`, `y4` are integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is greater than `i + 1`, and `res` is set based on the conditions provided.**
