The code calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to the variable `res`. Given that `y1` is less than `y2`, the absolute difference is simply `y2 - y1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `a` must be greater than 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, and `x4`, `y4` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user, and it is not the case that `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`. Additionally, it is not the case that `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`. The current configuration satisfies `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`. The current value of `y1` is less than the current value of `y2`. `res` is equal to `y2 - y1`.**
