The code snippet assigns the value of `y` to `max_val`. The value of `y` is initially defined as `x - 3`. This assignment does not affect the conditions or the return statement in the initial state description. Therefore, the updated state will reflect the new value of `max_val`, while the other conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, and `y` is `x - 3`. If `2 * y >= x`, the program returns `y`. If `2 * y < x`, `max_val` remains 1 or is set to `x - 2` based on the divisibility of `x` by `y`. `max_val` is `x - 3`.**
