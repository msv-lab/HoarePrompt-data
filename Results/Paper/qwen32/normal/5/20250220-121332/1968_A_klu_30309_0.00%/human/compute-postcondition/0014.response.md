The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 2`. In the next iteration, `y` will be decreased by 1 because the range function is defined as `range(x - 1, 1, -1)`. Therefore, `y` should be `x - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 3`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, then `max_val` is `x - 2`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, then `max_val` remains 1.**
