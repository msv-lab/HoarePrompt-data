Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always find the integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). 

Let's analyze the code:
- The function `func_1` iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
- It checks if \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)).
- If \( 2 \times y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
- Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues.
- Finally, it returns `max_val`.

The problem with this approach is that it might not always choose the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Specifically, the condition \( 2 \times y \geq x \) is too restrictive and does not guarantee the optimal \( y \).

Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 12 \):
- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11.
- The values of \( \gcd(12, y) + y \) for these divisors are:
  - \( \gcd(12, 11) + 11 = 1 + 11 = 12 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 4) + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
  - \( \gcd(12, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

The maximum value is 12, which can be achieved by either \( y = 11 \) or \( y = 6 \). However, the code might not always return the correct \( y \) because of the condition \( 2 \times y \geq x \).

For \( x = 12 \), the code will check \( y = 11 \) first, and since \( 2 \times 11 \geq 12 \) is true, it will return 11. This is correct in this case, but it might not be correct for other values of \( x \).

To ensure correctness, the code should evaluate \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for all \( y \) and keep track of the maximum value found, rather than using the restrictive condition \( 2 \times y \geq x \).

Thus, the code is incorrect for some potential cases.
