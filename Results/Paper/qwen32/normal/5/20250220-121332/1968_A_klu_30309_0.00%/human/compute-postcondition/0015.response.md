Output State: **The program returns y, which is x - 3, where x is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000.**

Explanation: The code returns the value of `y`, which is calculated as `x - 3`. The value of `x` is constrained to be an integer between 3 and 1000, inclusive. Therefore, `y` will be an integer between 0 and 997, inclusive.
