Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1. If `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`, `no` is set to False. Otherwise, `no` is set to False if the loop broke, otherwise `True`; and `counter` is the position where the loop broke if it broke, otherwise the length of `c`.**
