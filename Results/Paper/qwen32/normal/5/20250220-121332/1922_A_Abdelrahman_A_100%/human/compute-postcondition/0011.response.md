Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `slength` is an input integer, `no` is True, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `counter` is 0.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `counter` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
