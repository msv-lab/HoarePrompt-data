Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `counter` is 3. `x` is `c[4]`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original flow.**
