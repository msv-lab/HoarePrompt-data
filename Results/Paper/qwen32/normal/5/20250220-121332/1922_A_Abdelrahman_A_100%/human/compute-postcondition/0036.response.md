The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `tests`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `slength` is an input integer. Additionally, the conditions related to `no` and `counter` are provided.

The loop iterates over the range of `tests`, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `tests` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be 1, and so on. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1**.
