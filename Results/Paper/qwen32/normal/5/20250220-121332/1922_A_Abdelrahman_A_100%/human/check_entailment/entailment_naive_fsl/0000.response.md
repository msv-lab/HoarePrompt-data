Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Matching Logic**:
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and if so, prints "NO". This is correct because if `c` is exactly the same as `a` or `b`, there can't be a template where `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.
   - However, the logic for determining if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match while `c` does not is flawed. The program checks if any character in `c` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b` and concludes "YES" if so. This is incorrect because the template can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, and the program does not consider this flexibility.

2. **Template Flexibility**:
   - The template can have lowercase letters (which must match the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`) or uppercase letters (which must not match the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`).
   - The program does not attempt to construct such a template. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that if any character in `c` does not match the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`, then a valid template exists.

3. **Example Counter Case**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     3
     abc
     abc
     def
     ```
   - According to the problem description, the template "ABC" would make `a` and `b` match while `c` does not, so the correct output should be "YES". However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it doesn't correctly handle the template logic.

4. **Another Example**:
   - Consider:
     ```
     1
     2
     ab
     cd
     ef
     ```
   - Here, the template "AB" would make `a` match while `b` and `c` do not, so the correct output should be "YES". However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it doesn't correctly handle the template logic.

To fix the program, we need to construct a template that satisfies the conditions for `a` and `b` while not satisfying them for `c`. This requires checking each position and determining if it should be a lowercase or uppercase letter in the template.
