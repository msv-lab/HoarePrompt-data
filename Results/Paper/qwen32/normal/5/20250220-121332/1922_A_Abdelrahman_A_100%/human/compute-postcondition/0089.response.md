Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a non-empty string, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1, `counter` is 1, and `x` is the next character in `c` after the previous `x`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.**
