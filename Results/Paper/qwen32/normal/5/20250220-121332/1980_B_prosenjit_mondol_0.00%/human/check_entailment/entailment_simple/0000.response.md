### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, and then reads the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in descending order.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - `x` is set to the value of the favorite cube `a[f]`.
   - The program then compares `a[k]` (the value of the cube at the `k`-th position after sorting) with `x`:
     - If `a[k] > x`, it means that the cube at position `k` has a higher value than the favorite cube, so the favorite cube will not be removed in this case. Therefore, the program prints "NO".
     - If `a[k] < x`, it means that the cube at position `k` has a lower value than the favorite cube, so the favorite cube will definitely be removed in this case. Therefore, the program prints "YES".
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means that the cube at position `k` has the same value as the favorite cube. In this case:
       - If `k == n - 1`, it means that the favorite cube is the last cube in the sorted list, so it will not be removed. Therefore, the program prints "YES".
       - If `a[k - 1] < x`, it means that the cube just before the favorite cube in the sorted list has a lower value, so the favorite cube will definitely be removed. Therefore, the program prints "YES".
       - Otherwise, the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on the relative positions of cubes with the same value. Therefore, the program prints "MAYBE".

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and the provided examples. It accurately determines whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be either removed or left based on the sorted values of the cubes.

**Correctness: True**
