Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `f` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input minus 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `x` is the integer at index `f` of the sorted list `a`. Additionally, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`. If `a[k]` is strictly less than `x`, then `a[k]` remains strictly less than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is equal to `x`.**
