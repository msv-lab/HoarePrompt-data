Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `f` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input minus 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is the integer at index `f` of the list `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `x` is now the integer located at the index `f` in the list `a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) retain their initial values.
