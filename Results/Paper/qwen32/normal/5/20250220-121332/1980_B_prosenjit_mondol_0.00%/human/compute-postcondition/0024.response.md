The task is to determine the output of the `print('YES')` statement based on the given initial state. Let's break down the information provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `f` is an integer obtained from the input minus 2.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input minus 3.
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `x` is `a[f]`.

The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
