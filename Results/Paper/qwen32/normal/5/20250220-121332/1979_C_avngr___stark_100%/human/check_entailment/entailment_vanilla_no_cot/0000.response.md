Correctness: **False**

The provided program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers. However, the program does not include any logic to determine the bets for each outcome based on the problem's requirements. The solution should output a list of bets for each test case such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome.

To solve the problem, you need to find a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:

\[ x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n < k_1 \cdot x_1 \]
\[ x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n < k_2 \cdot x_2 \]
\[ \ldots \]
\[ x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n < k_n \cdot x_n \]

One possible approach is to set \( x_i = \text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n) / k_i \) for each \( i \). This ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function to calculate LCM of two numbers
def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

# Function to calculate LCM of a list of numbers
def lcm_list(numbers):
    return reduce(lcm, numbers)

# Main function to solve the problem
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        k = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        total_lcm = lcm_list(k)
        bets = [total_lcm // ki for ki in k]
        total_bet = sum(bets)
        
        if any(total_bet >= ki * bets[i] for i, ki in enumerate(k)):
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, bets)))
    
    print("\n".join(results))

# Uncomment the line below to run the solve function
# solve()
```

This program calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets for each outcome, ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
