Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers called `numbers`, where each integer is a multiplier between 2 and 20. It returns the result of a series of nested function calls, starting with `func_1(numbers[0], numbers[1])`, then using the result of that call with `numbers[2]` in another `func_1` call, and so on, until all elements in `numbers` have been used.**
