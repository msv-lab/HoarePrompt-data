The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. 

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]` followed by the character at index `i` of `s`.
- `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`.
- `i` is `i'`, `j` is `j'`.

After executing `ans += s[i]`, the string `ans` will now include the character `s[i]` appended to its current value. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `d`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing its previous value followed by `s[i]`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` is `i'`, `j` is `j'`.**
