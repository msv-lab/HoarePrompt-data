The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `len(s)`. Since `s` and `n` are not being modified in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Given that `i` is currently 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys 0 and 1, and values 0 and 1 if `s[i]` is '(', otherwise 0 and -1; `i` is 1.**
