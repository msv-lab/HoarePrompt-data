Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n`, and values representing the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the dictionary `d` will have keys from 0 to `n` (the length of the string `s`). Each key `i` in `d` will hold the cumulative balance of the parentheses sequence up to and including the character at index `i-1` in the string `s`. The balance is calculated by adding 1 for each '(' and subtracting 1 for each ')'. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated through the entire string `s`. The variables `s`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
