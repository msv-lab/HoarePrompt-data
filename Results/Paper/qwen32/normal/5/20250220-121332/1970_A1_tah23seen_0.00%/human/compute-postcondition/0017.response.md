Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys 0, 1, 2, and 3, and values 0, 1 (or -1), 2 (or 0) or -2 depending on whether `s[1]` is '(' or ')'. If `s[i]` is '(', then `d[3]` is `d[2] + 1`. Otherwise, `d[3]` is `d[2] - 1`. `i` is 2.**
