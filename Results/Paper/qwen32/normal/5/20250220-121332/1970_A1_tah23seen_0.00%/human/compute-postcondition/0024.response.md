The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `s` to the string `ans`. Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence and `i` is set to the value of the next tuple in `d`, the character `s[i]` is a specific character from `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]` followed by the character at index `i` of `s`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` and `j` are set to the values of the next tuple in `d`.**

In simpler terms, the character at index `i` of `s` has been appended to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
