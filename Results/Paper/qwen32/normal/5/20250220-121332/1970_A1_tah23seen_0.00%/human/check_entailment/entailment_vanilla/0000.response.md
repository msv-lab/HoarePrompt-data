Let's walk through the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the described balanced shuffle operation.

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `n` (which is renamed to `s` in `func_1`).

2. **Dictionary Initialization**: A dictionary `d` is initialized with the key `0` and value `0`. This dictionary will store the balance of the prefix up to each position in the string.

3. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is `'('`, the balance is incremented by 1.
   - If the character is `')'`, the balance is decremented by 1.
   - The balance at each position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d`.

4. **Removing the Last Element**: The last element of the dictionary `d` is removed using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the last element corresponds to the balance after the entire string, which is always `0` for a balanced parentheses sequence and not needed for sorting.

5. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted based on the prefix balance (second element of each tuple). If two elements have the same balance, they are sorted by their position in decreasing order (due to the `-i` in the lambda function, which is not present in the provided code, so it should be `key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])` to match the problem description).

6. **Reconstructing the Sequence**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of tuples and constructs the new sequence `ans` by appending the character at the position `i` of the original string `s`.

**Issue**:
The sorting step is not correctly implemented in the provided code. It should sort primarily by the balance and secondarily by the position in decreasing order. The current code does not account for the decreasing order of positions when balances are the same.

**Corrected Sorting**:
The sorting should be done as follows:
```python
d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
```

Since the provided code does not sort correctly based on the problem description, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
