The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the dictionary `d` by setting the value of `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of `d[2]` will be set to `d[1] - 1`.

Since the initial state specifies that `d` is a dictionary with keys 0 and 1, and values 0 and 1 if `s[i]` is '(', otherwise 0 and -1, we need to consider the value of `d[1]`:

- If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[1]` is 1, and `d[2]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.
- If `s[1]` is ')', then `d[1]` is -1, and `d[2]` will be `-1 - 1 = -2`.

Given that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the value of `d[1]` can be either 1 or -1. Therefore, `d[2]` will be either 0 or -2.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys 0, 1, and 2, and values 0 and 1 if `s[i]` is '(', otherwise 0 and -1 for `i=1`, and 0 or -2 for `i=2`; `i` is 1.**
