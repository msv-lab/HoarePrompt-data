Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` and `j` are set to the values of the first tuple in `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character `s[i]` followed by the character at index `i` of `s`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` and `j` are set to the values of the next tuple in `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing its previous value followed by `s[i]`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` is `i'`, `j` is `j'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
