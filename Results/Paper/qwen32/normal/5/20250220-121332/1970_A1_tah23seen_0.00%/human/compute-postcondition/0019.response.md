The code snippet `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since `d` initially has keys from 0 to `n`, removing the key `n` means that `d` will no longer contain the key `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n-1`, and values representing the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` is `n-1`.**
