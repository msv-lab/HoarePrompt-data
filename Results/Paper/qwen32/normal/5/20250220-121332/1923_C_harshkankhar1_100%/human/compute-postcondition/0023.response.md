Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the original `a`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, where each `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `b[1]` to `b[i]` with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is `n`; `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input; the program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the `q` queries.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (as specified by `q`), the state of the program includes the initial variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remaining unchanged. The variable `i` remains `n`. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the last query processed. The program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the `q` queries it processed.
