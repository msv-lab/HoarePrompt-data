Functionality: **The function accepts two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` (where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, inclusive) consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates two values: `cats_to_add`, which is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and `cats_to_remove`, which is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. The function returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.**
