#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length `n` and returns the maximum count of positions where one string has '0' and the other has '1'.
