### Reasoning:
To determine the minimum number of days required to transform the initial state of the cats in the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`), we need to consider the operations allowed:
1. Add a cat to a box that is currently empty.
2. Remove a cat from a box that currently has a cat.
3. Move a cat from one box to another.

The key observation here is that the third operation (moving a cat from one box to another) can be thought of as a combination of the first two (removing a cat from one box and adding it to another). Therefore, the number of days required is determined by the maximum of the following two counts:
- The number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`).
- The number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`).

This is because:
- If there are more cats to add than to remove, the limiting factor will be the number of cats that need to be added.
- Conversely, if there are more cats to remove than to add, the limiting factor will be the number of cats that need to be removed.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates these two counts and returns the maximum of the two, which is the minimum number of days required.

### Correctness: **True**
