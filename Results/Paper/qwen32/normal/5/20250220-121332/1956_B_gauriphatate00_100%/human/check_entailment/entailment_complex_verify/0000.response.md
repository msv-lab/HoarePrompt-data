### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The function `func_1` only counts the number of pairs of cards you have, but it does not consider the optimal moves by Nene, which is a crucial part of the problem.

The function `func_1` simply counts the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`. However, this count does not reflect the actual score you can achieve in the game because it does not simulate the alternating turns and the strategic decisions made by Nene.

Here's a breakdown of why the provided code is incorrect:

1. **Counting Pairs**: The function `func_1` counts the number of pairs of cards you have. This is a necessary step to understand the potential pairs, but it does not simulate the game.

2. **Optimal Play**: The problem requires simulating the game with optimal play by both you and Nene. Nene's strategy is to maximize her score and minimize your score. The function does not simulate this strategic play.

3. **Game Simulation**: To determine the maximum number of points you can get, the code would need to simulate the game, taking into account Nene's optimal moves. This involves considering the current state of the table and the cards each player has, and making decisions based on that state.

Given the problem's complexity and the need for strategic simulation, the provided code is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
