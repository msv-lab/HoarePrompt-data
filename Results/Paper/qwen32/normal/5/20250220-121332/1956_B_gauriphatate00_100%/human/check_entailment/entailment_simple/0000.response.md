### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the described card game. The strategy for scoring points relies on the fact that you gain a point if you play a card that has already been played by either player. Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the key to scoring points is to play cards that appear exactly twice in your hand, as these are the only cards that can be paired with another card of the same value to score points.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of unique integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` (your hand of cards). This count represents the maximum number of points you can score, assuming that you and Nene play optimally.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Counting Card Occurrences**: The program creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
2. **Calculating Maximum Score**: It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand. Each such number contributes 1 point to your score.

The provided example test cases and their outputs align with the logic of the program:
- In the first test case, the cards in your hand are `[1, 1, 2, 3]`. The number `1` appears twice, so the maximum score you can get is `1`.
- In the second test case, the cards in your hand are `[7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 5, 5]`. The numbers `8` and `5` appear twice, so the maximum score you can get is `2`.

The function correctly computes the maximum number of points you can score based on the given constraints and the optimal play strategy.
