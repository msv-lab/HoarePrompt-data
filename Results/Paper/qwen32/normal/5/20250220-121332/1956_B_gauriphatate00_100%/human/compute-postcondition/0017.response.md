The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. To ensure that the loop executes, the value of `n` must be at least 1, so that the range includes at least one integer (i.e., 1).

The state of `a`, `count_a`, and `max_score` are not directly relevant to the execution of the for loop itself, as they do not appear in the loop head. Therefore, we do not need to adjust them for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `max_score` is 0, `num` is 1**
