Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `count_a` is a dictionary. If `num` was already a key in `count_a`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_a` has `num` as a key with a value of 1. `a` must have at least one integer, and `num` is the next element in the list `a`. `count_a[num]` is 1.**

In natural language, this means that the dictionary `count_a` now has `num` as a key with a value of 1. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
