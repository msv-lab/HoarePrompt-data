Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `max_score` is 0, `num` is 1, and `num` is in `count_a`.**
