### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The function `func_1` only counts the number of pairs of cards you have, but it does not consider the optimal moves by Nene, which is a crucial part of the problem.

The function summary states that `func_1` calculates and returns the count of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`. This is true based on the implementation of `func_1`. However, this count does not equate to the maximum number of points you can achieve, especially when considering Nene's optimal play.

The original assessment is correct in pointing out that the code does not simulate the optimal play by Nene and does not account for the strategy that minimizes your score while maximizing hers. Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
