Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. The current value of `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2. `max_score` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` remains unchanged, along with the dictionary `count_a` and its specific conditions regarding `num`. The value of `max_score` has been incremented by 1, making it 1.
