The code snippet `count_a[num] = 1` sets the value of the key `num` in the dictionary `count_a` to 1. This means that if `num` was not already a key in `count_a`, it will now be added with a value of 1. If `num` was already a key in `count_a`, its value will be overwritten to 1.

Given the initial state, if `num` was already a key in `count_a` with a value of 1 or 2, it will now have a value of 1. If `num` was not a key in `count_a`, it will be added with a value of 1.

The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `count_a` is a dictionary with `num` as a key with a value of 1.**
