Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `count_a` is a dictionary with the key `num` and its value is 1, `a` must have at least one integer, and `num` is in `count_a` with a value of 1.**

In natural language: The list `a` remains unchanged, still containing `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. The integer `n` is still within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5. The dictionary `count_a` now contains the key `num` with its value set to 1. The variable `num` is now a key in `count_a` with a value of 1.
