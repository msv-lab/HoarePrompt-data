Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `n - a[i]` and the rest equal to `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`**

Natural Language Explanation:
The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the `i`-th element of the list `p`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `p` remain unchanged.
