To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop iterates from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`. In each iteration:
- The value of `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
- The value of `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

Starting from the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`.
- `mex` is `n`.

Let's break down the loop iterations:
1. **First iteration (i = n-1)**:
   - `p[n-1] = mex - a[n-1]`
   - `mex = min(mex, p[n-1])`
2. **Second iteration (i = n-2)**:
   - `p[n-2] = mex - a[n-2]`
   - `mex = min(mex, p[n-2])`
3. **Third iteration (i = n-3)**:
   - `p[n-3] = mex - a[n-3]`
   - `mex = min(mex, p[n-3])`
4. **...**
5. **Last iteration (i = 0)**:
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0]`
   - `mex = min(mex, p[0])`

After all iterations, the list `p` will have been filled with values `p[i] = mex - a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `mex` will be the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all `i`.

The final value of `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `p` will be filled with the values `mex - a[i]` for each index `i`, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `p`.
