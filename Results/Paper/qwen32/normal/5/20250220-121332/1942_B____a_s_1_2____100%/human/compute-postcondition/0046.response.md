The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, the value of `p[i]` is `p[n - 3]`. The precondition states that `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` for `i` being `n - 2`, and the rest equal to `-1`. Therefore, `p[n - 3]` is `-1` because `i` is not `n - 2`.

Thus, `mex` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `-1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` (where `i` is `n - 2`), the rest equal to `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, -1)`, `i` is `n - 3`**. 

In natural language, the value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `-1`. All other variables retain their initial states.
