Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes and prints a permutation `p` of the list `a` such that for each element in `p`, the value is determined by subtracting the corresponding element in `a` from a decreasing maximum value `mex`. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the required permutations.**
