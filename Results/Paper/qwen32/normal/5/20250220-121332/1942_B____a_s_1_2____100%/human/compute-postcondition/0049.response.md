Output State: **t is 0, n is undefined, a is undefined, p is undefined, mex is undefined.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly with each iteration. The variables `n`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` are redefined within each iteration of the loop based on the new inputs, so they do not have a defined value after the loop completes.
