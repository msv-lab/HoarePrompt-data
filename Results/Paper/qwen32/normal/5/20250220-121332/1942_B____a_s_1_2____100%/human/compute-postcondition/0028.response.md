The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 at each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` should be `n - 3`.

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[n - 2]` (where `i` is `n - 2`), and all other elements equal to `-1` or previously calculated values, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`, `i` is `n - 3`**
