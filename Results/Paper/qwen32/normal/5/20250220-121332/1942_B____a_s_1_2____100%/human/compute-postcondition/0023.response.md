The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` modifies the value at index `i` of the list `p` by setting it to `mex - a[i]`. Given the initial state, `mex` is `n`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. Therefore, `p[i]` will be updated to `n - a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `n - a[i]` and all other elements equal to `-1`, `mex` is `n`**.
