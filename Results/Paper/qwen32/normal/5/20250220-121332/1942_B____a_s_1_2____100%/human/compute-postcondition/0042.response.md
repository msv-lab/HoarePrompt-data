The code snippet modifies the `i`-th element of the list `p` by setting it to `mex - a[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`, so the last element of `p` is updated. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`, and the other elements of `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` (where `i` is `n - 1`), the rest equal to `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`, `i` is `n - 1`**.

In simpler terms, the last element of the list `p` is updated to `mex - a[n-1]`, and all other variables retain their previous values.
