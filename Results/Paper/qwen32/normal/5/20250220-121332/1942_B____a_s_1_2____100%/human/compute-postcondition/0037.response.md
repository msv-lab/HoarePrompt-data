The value of `mex` is updated to be equal to `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t-2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with each element equal to `-1`, and `mex` is now equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with each element equal to `-1`, `mex` is `n`**.
