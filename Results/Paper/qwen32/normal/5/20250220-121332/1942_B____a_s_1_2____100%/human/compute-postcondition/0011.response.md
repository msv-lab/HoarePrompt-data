The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `p[i]` is `p[1]`, which is `mex - a[1]`.

Initially, `mex` is `min(n, n - a[i])`, and `i` is 1, so `mex` is `min(n, n - a[1])`. After the execution of the code snippet, `mex` will be `min(min(n, n - a[1]), mex - a[1])`.

Since `mex` is initially `min(n, n - a[1])`, the expression simplifies to `min(min(n, n - a[1]), min(n, n - a[1]) - a[1])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the 1st element is `mex - a[1]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is `min(min(n, n - a[1]), min(n, n - a[1]) - a[1])`, `i` is 1**
