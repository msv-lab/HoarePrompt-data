### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

The program aims to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` such that for each `i`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, maintaining a variable `mex` which represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value of `MEX` for an array of length `n`.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
3. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

#### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Formula**: The formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` is derived from the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. By rearranging the equation, we get `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`. This means that `p[i]` should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p` minus `a[i]`.
- **Updating `mex`**: The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p` (up to the current point in the reverse iteration). This is crucial because it maintains the property that `mex` is the smallest integer not in the current prefix of `p`.

#### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Maintaining Validity of `mex`**: The program correctly updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` remains the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.
- **Ensuring Permutation**: Since `mex` is initialized to `n` and updated correctly, the values of `p[i]` will be unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`, ensuring that `p` is a valid permutation.

#### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case by iterating in reverse and using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`. The update of `mex` ensures that the constructed permutation is valid and contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` exactly once.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
