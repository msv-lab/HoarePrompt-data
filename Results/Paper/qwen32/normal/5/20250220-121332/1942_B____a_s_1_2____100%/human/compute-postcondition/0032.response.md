Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The variable `t` is defined as `t-1`. However, this seems to be an incomplete or incorrect statement since `t` is not defined previously. For the sake of this problem, we'll assume that `t` is not relevant to the final print statement.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the list `a` input by the user.
3. **`a`**: This is a list of integers input by the user.
4. **`p`**: This is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`. Here, `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.
5. **`mex`**: This is the minimum value in the list `p`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **User Input**: The user provides a list `a` of integers, and its length `n` is determined.
2. **List `p` Calculation**:
   - For each element `a[i]` in list `a`, the corresponding `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
   - The value of `mex` is initially unknown and needs to be determined.
3. **Determining `mex`**:
   - Since `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`, and `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, we need to find a consistent value for `mex` that makes all `p[i]` non-negative (since `mex` is a minimum non-negative value not in the list `a`).
   - The simplest consistent value for `mex` is `max(a) + 1`, as this ensures all `p[i]` values are non-negative and unique.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the user inputs the list `a` as `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `n = 3`
- To find `mex`, we calculate `max(a) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.
- Now, calculate `p[i]`:
  - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 4 - 1 = 3`
  - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 4 - 2 = 2`
  - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 4 - 3 = 1`
- The list `p` is `[3, 2, 1]`.

### Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **3 2 1 (where p is a list of length n with each element p[i] calculated as mex - a[i] and mex is the minimum value not in list a, ensuring all p[i] are non-negative)**

Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the calculated list `p`.

Output: **p (where p is a list of length n with each element p[i] calculated as mex - a[i] and mex is the minimum value not in list a, ensuring all p[i] are non-negative)**
