The given code snippet updates the list `a` by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and then storing these integers in the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` is already a list of integers, but this list is being replaced by the new input values.

The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `a` is reassigned to a new list of integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is an integer input by the user.**
