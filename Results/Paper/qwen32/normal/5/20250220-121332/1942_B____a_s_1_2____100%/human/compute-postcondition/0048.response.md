To determine the output of the `print(*p)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t-2` (This seems to be a misinterpretation or incomplete information as `t` is not defined in a way that provides a clear value or relationship. We can ignore this for now as it doesn't directly affect `p`).
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `p` is a list of length `n` with each i-th element equal to `mex - a[i]`.
- `mex` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest value in the list `p`.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This is a user-input list of integers. Its exact values are not provided, so we'll denote it as `a = [a1, a2, ..., an]`.
2. **List `p`**: This list is constructed such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`. 
3. **`mex` Calculation**:
    - `mex` is defined as the minimum value between `n` and the smallest value in `p`.
    - However, `p` is constructed using `mex`, which creates a circular dependency. To resolve this, we need to determine `mex` in an iterative manner:
        - Initially, we can assume `mex` to be `n` (the upper bound).
        - We then calculate `p` using this assumed `mex`.
        - We find the smallest value in `p` and update `mex` to be the minimum of `n` and this smallest value.
        - We repeat this process until `mex` stabilizes.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 5` and `a = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]` for demonstration purposes.

1. **Initial `mex`**: Assume `mex = 5`.
2. **Calculate `p`**: 
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 5 - 1 = 4`
   - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 5 - 3 = 2`
   - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 5 - 5 = 0`
   - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 4 = 1`
   - So, `p = [4, 2, 0, 3, 1]`.
3. **Update `mex`**: The smallest value in `p` is `0`. So, `mex = min(5, 0) = 0`.
4. **Recalculate `p`**:
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 0 - 1 = -1`
   - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 0 - 3 = -3`
   - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 0 - 5 = -5`
   - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 0 - 2 = -2`
   - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 0 - 4 = -4`
   - So, `p = [-1, -3, -5, -2, -4]`.
5. **Update `mex`**: The smallest value in `p` is `-5`. So, `mex = min(5, -5) = -5`.
6. **Recalculate `p`**:
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = -5 - 1 = -6`
   - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = -5 - 3 = -8`
   - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = -5 - 5 = -10`
   - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = -5 - 2 = -7`
   - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = -5 - 4 = -9`
   - So, `p = [-6, -8, -10, -7, -9]`.
7. **Update `mex`**: The smallest value in `p` is `-10`. So, `mex = min(5, -10) = -10`.
8. **Recalculate `p`**:
   - `p[0] = mex - a[0] = -10 - 1 = -11`
   - `p[1] = mex - a[1] = -10 - 3 = -13`
   - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = -10 - 5 = -15`
   - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = -10 - 2 = -12`
   - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = -10 - 4 = -14`
   - So, `p = [-11, -13, -15, -12, -14]`.

This process will continue until `mex` stabilizes, but for the purpose of this explanation, we can see that `p` is constructed based on the current `mex`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the iterative process, the final list `p` will be constructed such that each element is `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest value in `p`.

Output: **p (where p is a list of length n with each i-th element equal to mex - a[i], and mex is the minimum value between n and the smallest value in p)**
