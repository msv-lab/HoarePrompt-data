Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [-1] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        p[i] = mex - a[i]
        mex = min(mex, p[i])
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the length of the new list `a` input by the user, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is t-2, n is greater than or equal to 1, a is the new list of integers input by the user, p is a list of length n with each i-th element equal to mex - a[i], mex is the minimum value between n and the smallest value in the list p.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
