Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list to be returned and `k` is an integer. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is calculated as `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. For each subsequent element from `nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]`, the value is the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, and `k` is decremented by this value until `k` becomes 0, after which all remaining elements in the list are 0.**
