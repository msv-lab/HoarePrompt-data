To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

The code snippet is:
```python
nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
```

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`
- If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0 and `nums[i]` is `k` for some `i`. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value.
- The remaining elements of `nums` are 0.
- `i` is 2

The code modifies `nums[i]` (which is `nums[2]` given `i` is 2) to be the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`.

Since `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`:
- If `k` was greater than 0, `k` is now 0.
- If `k` was 0, `k` retains its value.

Let's consider both cases for `k`:

1. If `k` was greater than 0, it is now 0.
   - `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Since `k` was greater than 0, `k.bit_length() - 1` is at least 0, making `nums[0]` a positive integer.
   - `nums[2]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, 0)`, which is `0` because `nums[0] + 1` is positive.

2. If `k` was 0, it retains its value.
   - `nums[0]` is `(1 << 0.bit_length() - 1) - 1` which is `(1 << 0) - 1` which is `0`.
   - `nums[2]` is set to `min(0 + 1, 0)`, which is `0`.

In both cases, `nums[2]` becomes `0`.

Thus, the Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[2]` is 0, the remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is 2, and `k` is 0 if it was greater than 0, otherwise `k` retains its original value.**
