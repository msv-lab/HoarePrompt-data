The code snippet assigns `nums[i]` the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. Given that `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, we can determine the new value of `nums[i]`.

Let's break it down:
- `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
- `nums[0] + 1` will be the smallest power of 2 greater than `k` (since `nums[0]` is one less than a power of 2).
- `nums[i]` is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`.

Since `k` is greater than `nums[0]` (as given in the initial state), `nums[0] + 1` will be greater than `k`. Therefore, `nums[i]` will be set to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[i]` is `k`, and the remaining elements are 0.**
