You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0 if enough iterations reduce `k` to 0, otherwise `k` retains the remaining value, `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, and `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list to be returned and `k` is an integer. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is calculated as `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. For each subsequent element from `nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]`, the value is the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, and `k` is decremented by this value until `k` becomes 0, after which all remaining elements in the list are 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, and `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
