The code snippet assigns the value of `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` to `nums[i]`. Given the initial state, `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `i` is 3. Therefore, `nums[3]` is updated to `min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + 1, k)`, which simplifies to `min(1 << k.bit_length() - 1, k)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[2]` is 0, `nums[3]` is `min(1 << k.bit_length() - 1, k)`, and the remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is 3, and `k` retains its original value.**
