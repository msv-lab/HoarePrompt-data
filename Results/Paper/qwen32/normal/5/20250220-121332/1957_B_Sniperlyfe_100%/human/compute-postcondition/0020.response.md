Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element `nums[0]` is calculated as `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. Each subsequent element from `nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]` is the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, with `k` being decremented by this value. Once `k` becomes 0, all remaining elements in the list are set to 0.**
