Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is [1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], ..., (1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]) + T[n-1]], `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`**

In simpler terms: The value of `t` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
