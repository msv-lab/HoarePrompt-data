The code appends a new value to the list `a`. This new value is the sum of the element at index `i-1` of `a` and the element at index `i-1` of `T`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value is `a[1] + T[1]`.

The initial state of `a` is `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1]]`. So, `a[1]` is `1000 + T[0]`. The new value to be appended is `(1000 + T[0]) + T[1]`.

After the append operation, `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1] + T[1]]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the string input by the user, `a` is `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], (1000 + T[0]) + 2*T[1]]`, `i` is 2**.
