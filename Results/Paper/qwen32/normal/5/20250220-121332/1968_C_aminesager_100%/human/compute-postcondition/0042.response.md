Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the new string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is [1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], ((1000 + T[0]) + T[1]) + T[2]], `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`, `i` is 3**.

In natural language: The variable `a` has been updated to include a new element, which is the sum of the last element of `a` and the third element of `T`. The other variables remain unchanged.
