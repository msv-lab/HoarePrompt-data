Let's break down the given initial state step-by-step to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: A non-zero integer that is decreased by 1. However, the specific value of `t` does not affect the `result` variable or the `print(result)` statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 500\). This is the number of elements in the list `T`.
3. **`T`**: A list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`. The length of `T` is `n`.
4. **`line`**: A new string input by the user, which is split into integers to form the list `T`.
5. **`a`**: A list constructed as follows:
   - The first element is `1000`.
   - The second element is `1000 + T[0]`.
   - The third element is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`.
   - And so on, up to the `n`-th element, which is `1000 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-2} T[j]`.
6. **`result`**: A space-separated string of the elements in the list `a`.

### Calculation of `a`:
- `a[0]` is `1000`.
- `a[1]` is `1000 + T[0]`.
- `a[2]` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`.
- ...
- `a[n-1]` is `1000 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-2} T[j]`.

### Example Calculation:
If `T = [10, 20, 30]` (for `n = 3`), then:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = 1000 + 10 + 20 = 1030`

Thus, `a = [1000, 1010, 1030]` and `result` would be the space-separated string `"1000 1010 1030"`.

### General Description:
- The `result` is a space-separated string of the cumulative sums starting from `1000` and adding each element of `T` sequentially.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is a space-separated string of the cumulative sums starting from 1000 and adding each element of T sequentially)**
