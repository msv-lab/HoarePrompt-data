The code snippet `template.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. Given that `i` is 2, the character at index 2 of `a` is appended to `template`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a`, either the second character of `a` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[1]` equals `b[1]`, and the third character of `a`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 2.**
