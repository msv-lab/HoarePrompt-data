The code `c = input().strip()` assigns the value of the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed to the variable `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
