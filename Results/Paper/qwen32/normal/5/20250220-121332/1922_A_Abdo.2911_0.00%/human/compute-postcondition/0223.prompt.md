Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the range `n`); `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains `a[i]` at that position. `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `False` or `True` (or both) based on the original condition.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 0; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains `a[i]` at that position; `match_a_b` is `False` if `template[i]` is a lowercase character and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `match_c` is `False` or `True` based on the original condition. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, otherwise `match_a_b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 1; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains `a[i]` at that position. If `template[i]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i] != template[i]` or `b[i] != template[i]`; if `template[i]` is not lowercase, `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, otherwise `match_a_b` remains unchanged; `match_c` is `False` or `True` based on the original condition. If `match_a_b` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i] != template[i]` or `b[i] != template[i]`; if `template[i]` is not lowercase, `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, otherwise `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `match_a_b` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
