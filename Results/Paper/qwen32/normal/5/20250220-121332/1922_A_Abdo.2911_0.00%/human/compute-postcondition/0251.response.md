Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is incremented by 1; `template` and `match_a_b` remain as per their definitions and values from the previous iteration; if `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, the execution continues; otherwise, `match_c` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
