The given code snippet is:
```
match_c = True
```
This line of code explicitly sets the value of `match_c` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `match_a_b`, `i`) are affected by this line.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the conditions for setting `match_a_b` to `False` were met during any iteration, otherwise `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is `n`.**
