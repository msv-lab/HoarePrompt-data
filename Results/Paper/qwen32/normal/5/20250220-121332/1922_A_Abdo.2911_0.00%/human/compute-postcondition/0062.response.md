Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `match_a_b` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `False`; `template[i]` is an uppercase character; `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `template[i]`, and `c[i]` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
