Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True` or `False`; `match_c` is `True` or `False`. The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final output will have been printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then determines if the string `c` matches a specific pattern derived from `a` and `b`, and prints "YES" if `c` matches the pattern and "NO" otherwise. The pattern is such that for each position, if `a` and `b` have the same character, `c` must also have the same character; if `a` and `b` differ, `c` must not have the same character as either `a` or `b` at that position.
