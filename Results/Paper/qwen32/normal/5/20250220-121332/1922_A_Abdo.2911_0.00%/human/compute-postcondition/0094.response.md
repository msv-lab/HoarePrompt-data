Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is an empty list; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`.**
