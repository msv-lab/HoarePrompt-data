Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, otherwise `match_a_b` remains `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0; `template[i]` is not a lowercase character.**
