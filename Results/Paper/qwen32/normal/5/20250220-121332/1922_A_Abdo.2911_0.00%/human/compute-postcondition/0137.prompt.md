Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, otherwise `match_a_b` remains `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is `False`. If `template[i]` is uppercase and either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
