Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 0; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `template` contains `a[i]` at that position; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `False` or `True` based on the original condition; `template[i]` is a lowercase character; either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.**
