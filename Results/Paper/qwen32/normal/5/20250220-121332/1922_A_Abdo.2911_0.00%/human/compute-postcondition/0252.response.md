Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is incremented by 1; `template` and `match_a_b` remain as per their definitions and values from the previous iteration. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its previous value.**
