Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `template[i]` is an uppercase letter. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.**
