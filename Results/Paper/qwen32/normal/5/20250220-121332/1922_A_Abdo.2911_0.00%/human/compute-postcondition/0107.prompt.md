Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is an empty list; `match_a_b` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_c` is `False`; `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing either the first character of `a` or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` depending on whether the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, `template` contains the first character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the first character of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` and either the second character of `a` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `template` includes the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` includes the uppercase version of the second character of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a`, either the second character of `a` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[1]` equals `b[1]`, and either the third character of `a` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[2]` equals `b[2]`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
