Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` where each character at index `i` is either the character of `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the conditions for setting `match_a_b` to `False` were met during any iteration, otherwise `match_a_b` is `True`; `i` is 0. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is `False`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, `match_c` is `False` if `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, otherwise `match_c` remains `True`.**
