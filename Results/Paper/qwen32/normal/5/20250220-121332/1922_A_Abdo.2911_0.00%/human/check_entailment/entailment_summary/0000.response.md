Reasoning:

The given program `func_1` aims to solve the problem by constructing a template string `t` based on the strings `a` and `b`. The template is constructed such that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` is set to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`, since they are the same).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`, since they are different).

After constructing the template, the program checks two conditions:
1. Both `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching logic is as follows:
- If a character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in the string must be exactly the same.
- If a character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

The program then prints "YES" if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, otherwise it prints "NO".

The provided execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the logic used in the code matches the problem requirements. The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
