The `break` statement will terminate the loop it is in, but it does not affect the values of the variables directly. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` remain unchanged except for `match_a_b`, which is set to `False` because the loop breaks.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is `i + 1` if `i < n - 1`; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `False`.**
