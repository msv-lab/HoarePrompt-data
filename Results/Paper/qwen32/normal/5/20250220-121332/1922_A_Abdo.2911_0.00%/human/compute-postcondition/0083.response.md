Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
4. `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match.
5. `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`.
6. `i` is `n`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. Notably, the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`, or `i`. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Based on the given code snippet and the initial state, the output is straightforward and does not involve any calculations or variable values.

Output: **YES**
