The code snippet appends the uppercase version of the character at index `i` in string `a` to the list `template`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and the condition about the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` being different) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`; the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `b`.**
