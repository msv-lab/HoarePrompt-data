You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True` or `False`; `match_c` is `True` or `False`. The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final output will have been printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then determines if the string `c` matches a specific pattern derived from `a` and `b`, and prints "YES" if `c` matches the pattern and "NO" otherwise. The pattern is such that for each position, if `a` and `b` have the same character, `c` must also have the same character; if `a` and `b` differ, `c` must not have the same character as either `a` or `b` at that position.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The program provided aims to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not. Here's how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (length of the strings) and then the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs a template `t` by iterating through each character position `i` of the strings.
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same (`a[i] == b[i]`), it sets the template character at position `i` to the lowercase version of that character (`template.append(a[i])`).
   - If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, it sets the template character at position `i` to the uppercase version of the character from `a` (`template.append(a[i].upper())`).

3. **Matching Check**:
   - It then checks if strings `a` and `b` match the constructed template `t`:
     - For each character position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` equals the lowercase version of the template character.
   - It also checks if string `c` does not match the template `t`:
     - For each character position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if `c[i]` equals the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If `a` and `b` both match the template and `c` does not, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic for constructing the template ensures that for positions where `a` and `b` have the same character, the template will force `c` to differ.
   - For positions where `a` and `b` have different characters, the template will force `c` to match one of the characters from `a` or `b`, thus not matching the template.
   - The checks for matching and non-matching are correctly implemented based on the problem statement.

The program correctly constructs the template and checks the conditions as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
