The code `list2.append(int(str))` takes the string `str`, converts it to an integer, and appends it to `list2`. Given that `str` is the third word in `list1`, and `list2` already includes the integer value of the second word in `list1`, the new integer value of `str` (the third word in `list1`) will be added to `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 3 words, `str` is the third word in `list1`, `list2` now includes the integer value of the second word in `list1` and the integer value of `str`.**

In natural language: `list1` remains a list of words with at least 3 words, `str` still holds the value of the third word in `list1`, and `list2` now contains the integer value of the second word in `list1` and also includes the integer value of `str` (the third word in `list1`).
