You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard. This is followed by a line containing 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases, t, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: final is a list of n sums, where each sum is the sum of the integers at even indices of the sorted list of integers provided in each iteration.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: The loop will print each element of the `final` list, which contains `n` sums. Each sum is the sum of the integers at even indices of the sorted list of integers provided in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of the integers located at even indices in the sorted list. The function then prints the sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `num` (which should represent `2n` integers as per the problem statement) but this `num` is not used correctly.
   - It then reads two lines of input for each test case:
     - The first line is supposed to be the integer `n` (number of pairs), but it is not used.
     - The second line contains `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the integers into a list, converts them to integers, and sorts them.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair to the score `s`. This is the optimal strategy to maximize the score since the smallest number in each pair is always added to the score.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, it stores the final score in the `final` list.
   - Finally, it prints all the scores stored in the `final` list.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Input Parsing:**
  - The program incorrectly reads two lines for each test case instead of one line with `2n` integers.
  - The first line read for each test case (which should be the integer `n`) is not used and is instead read as a separate line of integers, which is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:

To make the program correct, we need to read the input properly. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):  # For each test case
        n = int(input())  # Read the integer n (number of pairs)
        a = input().split()  # Read the 2n integers
        list2 = [int(x) for x in a]  # Convert to integers
        list2.sort()  # Sort the list
        s = 0
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):  # Iterate through the list in steps of 2
            s += list2[i]  # Add the first element of each pair to the score
        final.append(s)  # Store the final score
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)  # Print the final scores

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to improper input parsing. The corrected version of the program properly reads the input and follows the optimal strategy to solve the problem.

Reasoning: The original program does not correctly parse the input and incorrectly reads two lines for each test case instead of one line with `2n` integers.
Correctness: **False**
