The code snippet `list2.sort()` sorts the elements of `list2` in ascending order. Since `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, after sorting, `list2` will have its elements rearranged in increasing order. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, sorted in ascending order; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`; `str` is the last element in `list1`.**
