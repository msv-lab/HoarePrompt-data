The code snippet `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, `str`, `final`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only change is the sorted order of `list2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `s` is 0, `list2` is a sorted list of integers corresponding to each substring in `list1`, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the new user's input string, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`, `str` is undefined, `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it, `num` is incremented by 1.**
