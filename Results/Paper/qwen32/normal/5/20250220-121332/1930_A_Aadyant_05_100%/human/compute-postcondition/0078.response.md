Given the initial state, `final` is a list of `n` sums, where each sum is the sum of integers at even indices of a sorted list of integers provided in each iteration. It is also mentioned that `final` must have at least three elements, and `fin` is the third element in `final`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `fin`. By definition, `fin` is the third element in the `final` list. Since the exact values in the `final` list are not specified, we can only describe `fin` in terms of its position in the `final` list.

The print statement `print(fin)` will output the value of `fin`, which is the third element of the `final` list.

Output: **fin (where fin is the third element in the final list)**
