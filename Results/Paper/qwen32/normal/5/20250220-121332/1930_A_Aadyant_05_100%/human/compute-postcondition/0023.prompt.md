Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, sorted in ascending order; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`; `str` is the last element in `list1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
    s = s + int(list2[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the integer value of `list2[i]`; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, sorted in ascending order, and `list2` must have at least one element; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b` and must have at least one element; `str` is the last element in `list1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of the integer values of `list2[i]` and `list2[i+2]`; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, sorted in ascending order, and `list2` must have at least one element; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b` and must have at least one element; `str` is the last element in `list1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of the integer values of `list2[i]` and `list2[i+2]` plus `int(list2[i + 2])`; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, sorted in ascending order, and `list2` must have at least one element; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b` and must have at least one element; `str` is the last element in `list1`; `i` is `i + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
