Postcondition: **`cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is either `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 1}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `num + 1` or `0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`.**
