Postcondition: **`cnt` contains all unique elements from `N` that have a count of 1 in `M` and has at least 2 elements; `T` is `T-1`; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`.**
