Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `cur` is 0, `M` is an empty dictionary. The current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
