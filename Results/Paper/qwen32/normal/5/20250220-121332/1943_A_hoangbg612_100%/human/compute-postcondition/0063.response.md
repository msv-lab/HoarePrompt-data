Output State: **`cur` is 0, `M` is {}, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer. The current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and greater than `cur`.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, making it 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
