To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `cnt` is a list.
- If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is set to `cnt[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or is not set.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cur)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `cnt`**: It is a list, but we do not know its exact contents.
2. **Variable `cur`**: Its value depends on the length of `cnt`.
    - If `len(cnt) >= 2`, then `cur` is set to `cnt[1]`.
    - If `len(cnt) < 2`, then `cur` is not set or remains unchanged.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` will be the second element of `cnt` (i.e., `cnt[1]`).
- **Scenario 2**: If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements, `cur` is not set or remains unchanged. This means that trying to print `cur` in this scenario will result in a `NameError` because `cur` is not defined.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact contents of `cnt` are not provided, we cannot definitively state the value of `cur`. However, we can describe the behavior based on the length of `cnt`.

- If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, the output will be the second element of `cnt`.
- If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements, an error will occur because `cur` is not defined.

Given the problem's constraints and the lack of specific information about `cnt`, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **cur (where cur is cnt[1] if len(cnt) >= 2, otherwise cur is not defined)**

However, since the problem asks for what will be printed, and considering the possibility of an error, the safest and most accurate answer is:

Output: **cur (where cur is cnt[1] if len(cnt) >= 2, otherwise a NameError will occur)**

But since we are asked to provide the output based on the precondition and the most precise description possible, we will stick to:

Output: **cur (where cur is cnt[1] if len(cnt) >= 2, otherwise cur is not defined)**
