To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the progression of the loop through the first three iterations.

**Initial State Recap:**
- `T`: An integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 (not directly used in the loop logic, but part of the precondition).
- `S`: An input integer (not directly used in the loop logic, but part of the precondition).
- `N`: A sorted list of integers.
- `cur`: Initially set to -1.
- `M`: An initially empty dictionary.

**Loop Behavior:**
- The loop iterates over each element `num` in the sorted list `N`.
- If `num` is greater than `cur`:
  - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to `cur + 1` and the loop breaks.
  - Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num`, and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
- If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State Analysis:**
- After the first iteration, `cur` is updated to the first element of `N` if it is greater than -1, and `M` will have the first element as a key with a value of 1.
- After the second iteration, `cur` is updated to the second element if it is greater than the first element, and `M` will reflect the count of occurrences of the current `cur`.
- After the third iteration, the same logic applies, updating `cur` and `M` as necessary.

**Final Output State:**
- The loop will iterate over all elements in `N`.
- `cur` will be the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop (i.e., no element was greater than `cur + 1`).
- `M` will contain keys for each unique element in `N` up to the point where the loop did not break, with values representing their respective counts.

**Output State:**
- `cur` will be the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop.
- `M` will be a dictionary with keys as the unique elements of `N` up to the point where the loop did not break, and values as their respective counts.

**Final Output State Representation:**
- If the loop goes through all elements without breaking, `cur` will be the last element of `N`.
- `M` will have all elements of `N` as keys with their respective counts.

Output State: **`cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop, and `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts.**

In simple terms, `cur` will be the last element of `N` if no element was greater than `cur + 1` during the loop, and `M` will contain the count of each element in `N` up to that point.
