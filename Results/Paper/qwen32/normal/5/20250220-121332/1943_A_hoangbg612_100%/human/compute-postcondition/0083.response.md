The code snippet `cur = num` directly assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The variable `num` is specified as the next element in the list `N`. Therefore, after executing the code, `cur` will take the value of `num`.

No other variables are modified by this code snippet, so their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `M` is either `{num: 1}`, `{num: 2}`, or `{-1: 2}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one more integer, `num` is the next element in `N`.**
