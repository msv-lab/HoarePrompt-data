The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. This means that the list `cnt` will now include the value of `k` as its last element.

Output State: **`cur` is the largest number in `N` processed without a gap greater than 1, incremented by 1 if the sum of the counts of all unique numbers in `M` equals `S`, `M` is a dictionary with counts of each unique number in `N` and must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is a list (potentially empty) and if `M[k] == 1`, then `k` is appended to `cnt` and now includes `k` as its last element, `S` is the integer value from user input, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`**.

In simpler terms, the list `cnt` now includes the value of `k` as its last element. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
