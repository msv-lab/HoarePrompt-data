The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables (`cnt`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed, `cur` is incremented by 1.**
