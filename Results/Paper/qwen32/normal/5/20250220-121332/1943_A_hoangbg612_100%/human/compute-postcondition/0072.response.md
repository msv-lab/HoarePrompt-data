Output State: **`cur` is either `num + 1` or `0`, `M` is either `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 1}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer, `num` is the next element in `N`.**

In simple terms, the value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so if `cur` was `num`, it is now `num + 1`, and if `cur` was `-1`, it is now `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
