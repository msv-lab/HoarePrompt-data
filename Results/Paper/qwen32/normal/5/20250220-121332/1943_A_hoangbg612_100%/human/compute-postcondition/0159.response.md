The code assigns the value of the second element in the list `cnt` to the variable `cur`. Since `cnt` contains all unique elements from `N` that have a count of 1 in `M` and has at least 2 elements, `cur` will now hold the value of the second unique element in `cnt`.

Output State: **`cnt` contains all unique elements from `N` that have a count of 1 in `M` and has at least 2 elements; `T` is `T-1`; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is the second element of `cnt`.**
