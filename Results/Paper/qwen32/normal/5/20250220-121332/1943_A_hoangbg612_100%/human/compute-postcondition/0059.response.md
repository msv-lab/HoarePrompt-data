The code snippet provided resets the dictionary `M` to an empty dictionary. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cur` is -1, `M` is {}, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order.**
