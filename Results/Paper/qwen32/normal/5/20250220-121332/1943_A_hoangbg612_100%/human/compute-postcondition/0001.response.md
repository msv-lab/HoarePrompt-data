The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`. Since the loop head uses `T` to determine the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `T` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't affect the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Given the provided state, `T` is already described as an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `T` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4**
