Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`. If `x` equals 1, `big` contains `a`. If `x` equals 2, `a` is appended to `less`. Otherwise, `a` is appended to `no`.**
