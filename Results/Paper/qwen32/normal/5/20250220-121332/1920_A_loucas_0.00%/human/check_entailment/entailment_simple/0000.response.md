### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).
   - It then reads each constraint and categorizes them into three lists based on the type of constraint: `less` for constraints of type 2, `big` for constraints of type 1, and `no` for constraints of type 3.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - The program attempts to find the range of valid `k` values by taking the maximum value from the `big` list (which represents the smallest possible value `k` can take, due to constraints of type 1) and the minimum value from the `less` list (which represents the largest possible value `k` can take, due to constraints of type 2).
   - It then iterates through this range and checks if any value `i` is not in the `no` list (which contains values that `k` cannot be due to constraints of type 3).

3. **Counting Valid `k` Values:**
   - The program incorrectly assigns the first valid `i` it finds to `num` and breaks out of the loop. This means it only counts the first valid `k` value it encounters, rather than counting all valid `k` values.
   - The program should instead count all valid `k` values in the range and print this count.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly count the number of valid `k` values. Instead, it only finds and prints the first valid `k` value it encounters.
- The program should iterate through the range and count all values that are not in the `no` list.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirement of counting all valid `k` values that satisfy all constraints.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program that counts all valid `k` values:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.append(x)
        
        min_k = max(big)
        max_k = min(less)
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(min_k, max_k + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version iterates through the range from `min_k` to `max_k` (inclusive) and counts all values that are not in the `no` list, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
