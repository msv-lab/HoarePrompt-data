Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is equal to the number of iterations, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values.
