Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` is a list containing `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list containing `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
