The variable `num` is explicitly set to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, and `big`, `less`, and `no` are all empty lists. The value of `num` is recalculated based on the conditions provided, but since it is directly set to 0 in the code snippet, the previous calculation is overridden.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0.**
