Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an input integer, Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
        if i not in no:
            num = i
            break
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is equal to the number of iterations, `num` is `first_valid_i` if `first_valid_i` is not in `no`, otherwise `num` remains 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `num` is the first value in the range `[max(big), min(less))` that is not in `no` or 0 if no such value exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the user input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `num` is `max(big) + 3`, `big` is a list containing at least one element, `less` is a list containing at least one element greater than the maximum element in `big`, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
