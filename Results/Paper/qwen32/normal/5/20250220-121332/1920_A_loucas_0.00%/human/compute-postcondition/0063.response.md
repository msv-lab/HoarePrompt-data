Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to the previous value of `innerLoop`, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 1.**
