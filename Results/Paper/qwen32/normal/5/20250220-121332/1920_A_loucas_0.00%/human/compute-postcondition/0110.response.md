Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `big` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
