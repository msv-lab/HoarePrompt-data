The code snippet appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2.**
