You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: `loop` is 0, `iterable` is equal to the initial value of `loop`, `innerLoop`, `less`, `big`, `no`, and `num` reflect the state after processing the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines of constraints. Each constraint is defined by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` indicates the type of constraint (1 for `k >= x`, 2 for `k <= x`, and 3 for `k != x`). The function returns the smallest integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
