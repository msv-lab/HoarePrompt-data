Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the user input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., [1]), `less` is a list containing at least one element greater than the maximum element in `big` (e.g., [2]), `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `i` is not in `no`.**
