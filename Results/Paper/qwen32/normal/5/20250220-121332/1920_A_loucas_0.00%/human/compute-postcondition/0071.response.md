Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
