Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `num` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. All the variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
