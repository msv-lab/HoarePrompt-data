num is a list of integers where the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and m (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
