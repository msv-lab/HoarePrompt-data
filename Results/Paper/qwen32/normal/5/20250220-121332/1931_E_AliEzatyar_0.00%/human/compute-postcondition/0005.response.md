Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `counter` is 0, and `num[i]` is not equal to '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `num` and `counter` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
