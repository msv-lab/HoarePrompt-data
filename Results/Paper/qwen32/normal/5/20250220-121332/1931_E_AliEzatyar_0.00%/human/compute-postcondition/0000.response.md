The code snippet provided initializes a variable `counter` to 0. The initial state describes `num` as a list of integers where the first integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two lines of integers. The values of `num`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged by the code snippet.

The only change is the introduction of the `counter` variable, which is set to 0.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where the first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `counter` is 0.**
