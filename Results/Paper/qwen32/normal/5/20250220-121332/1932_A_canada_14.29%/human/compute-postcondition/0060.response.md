The code snippet sets the variable `thorn` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change in the state is that `thorn` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`; `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0.**
