The code snippet sets `thorn` to 0. This change affects the variable `thorn` directly, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the integer input by the user, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `ret` is either 1 or 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`.**
