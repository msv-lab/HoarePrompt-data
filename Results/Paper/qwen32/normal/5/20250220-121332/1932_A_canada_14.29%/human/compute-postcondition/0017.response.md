Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is either 1 or 2 if the current character `i` is equal to '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0; if `i` is equal to '*' and `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; if `i` is not equal to '@' and not equal to '*', `thorn` remains 0.**
