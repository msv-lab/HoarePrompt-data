Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the integer input by the user, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `ret` is either 1 or 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is `thorn + 1` if the current character `i` is '*', and `thorn` remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*', `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
