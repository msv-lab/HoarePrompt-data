Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 2 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 3 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', `thorn` remains 2 if `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, and remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*'; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` was 2 and `i` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the integer input by the user, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`. If the current character `i` is '@', `ret` is either 2 or 3, and `thorn` is 0. If the current character `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, set to 3 if `thorn` was 2 before, and remains 2 if `thorn` was 2 before; otherwise, `thorn` remains 0. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the current character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
