The code snippet provided only resets the variable `thorn` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for `thorn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0.**
