The code snippet provided is simply a condition `thorn == 0`, which is a comparison and does not change any variable values. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 2 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*'; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.
