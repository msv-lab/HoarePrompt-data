The provided code snippet simply reassigns the value of `thorn` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the value of `thorn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0; the current character `i` is '@'**
