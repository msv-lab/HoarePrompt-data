The code snippet `len = int(input())` changes the value of the variable `len` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is the count of '@' characters in `s` before `thorn` reaches 2; `thorn` is 0 if the loop completes without `thorn` reaching 2, or 2 if the loop breaks due to encountering two consecutive '*' characters.**
