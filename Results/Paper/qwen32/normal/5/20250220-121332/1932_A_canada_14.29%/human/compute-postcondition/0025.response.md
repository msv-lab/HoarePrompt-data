The given code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison and does not actually change the value of `thorn`. It simply evaluates to `True` or `False` depending on whether `thorn` is `0` or not. Since this comparison does not affect any of the variables, the values of `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0 if the current character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is 1 if the current character `i` is '*', and `thorn` is 2 if the current character `i` is '*' and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
