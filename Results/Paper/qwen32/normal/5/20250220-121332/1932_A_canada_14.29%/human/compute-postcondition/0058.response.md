Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character. If the current character `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. Otherwise, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is either 0 or 2. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.**
