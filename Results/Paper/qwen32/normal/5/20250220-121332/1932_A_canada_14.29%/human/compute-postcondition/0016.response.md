The provided code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison operation that checks if the variable `thorn` is equal to 0. This operation does not assign any value to `thorn` or any other variable; it simply evaluates to a boolean value (True or False). Since the operation does not change the state of any variable, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0; the current character `i` is not equal to '@' and `i` is not equal to '*'**
