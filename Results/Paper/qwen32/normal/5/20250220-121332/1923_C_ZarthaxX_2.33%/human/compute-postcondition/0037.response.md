The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. However, the loop iterates `q` times, so the variable `q` implicitly controls the loop. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we only need to adjust `q` to reflect the next iteration.

Given that the loop runs `q` times, at the start of each iteration, the value of `q` should be decremented by 1 until it reaches 0, at which point the loop terminates.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `q` is greater than 0; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition (2 * `onesInRange` + (`r` - `l` + 1) - `onesInRange` <= `sumInRange`) holds true, then the if block executes; otherwise, the else block executes. The condition accurately reflects whether `l` equals `r` or not, maintaining the relationships and values of all variables as described in the precondition.

To execute the next iteration of the loop, we need to decrement `q` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q-1` are integers where 1 <= n, q-1 <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.**
