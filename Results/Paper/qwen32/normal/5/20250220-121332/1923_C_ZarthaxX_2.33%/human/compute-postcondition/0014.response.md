The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range `q`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `t`, `n`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure that the loop executes, `q` must be greater than 0. The underscore `_` is a conventional variable name used when the loop variable is not needed, so its state does not need to be specified.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `q` must be greater than 0**
