To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the state of the variables after `q` iterations. The loop itself doesn't change the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum`. It only processes the input values `l` and `r` for each iteration and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition.

Given that the loop executes `q` times, after all iterations, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remains the same as the initial state. The only variables that change are `l` and `r` in each iteration, but they do not persist after the loop completes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop, the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remain unchanged from their initial state. The loop processes `q` pairs of `l` and `r` values, but these do not persist after the loop ends.
