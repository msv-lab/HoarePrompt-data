Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `q` is greater than 0; `l` and `r` are integers; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. If `l == r`, the program does not change the state of any variables. Otherwise, the else part does not execute since it is not provided.**

In simple terms, the output state includes all the initial conditions provided, with the addition of the variable `onesInRange` which is calculated as the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]`. If `l` equals `r`, no changes are made to the state of any variables.
