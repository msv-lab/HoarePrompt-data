You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It also reads `q` queries, each consisting of a range `[l, r]`. For each query, the function determines whether a specific condition is met based on the count of 1s and the sum of elements in the specified range `[l, r]` of `nums`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good based on the given problem description. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program uses two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the adjusted sum of the subarray elements, respectively. Here is a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of ones up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the elements up to index `i-1` minus the count of ones up to index `i-1`.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of ones and the adjusted sum in the subarray `c[l:r+1]`.
   - It then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds to determine if the subarray is good.

However, there is a fundamental flaw in the logic used to determine if a subarray is good. The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is not correctly reflecting the requirement that there must exist an array `b` such that:
- The sum of `a` and `b` are equal.
- Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
- Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
3 1
2 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output**:
```
YES
```

**Explanation**:
- The subarray `c[1:3]` is `[2, 2, 2]`.
- We can construct `b` as `[1, 1, 1]` which satisfies all the conditions:
  - Sum of `a` and `b` are equal: `2 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.
  - Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
  - Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

However, the provided program will output `NO` for this test case because the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not hold true for this specific case.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
