The code snippet updates the `ones` list at index `i` by adding 1 if the element at index `i-1` in the `nums` list is 1, otherwise, it adds 0. This means `ones[i]` now holds the count of 1s from the start of `nums` up to index `i-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, and now `ones[i]` has been updated to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for the specific `i` being updated; `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
