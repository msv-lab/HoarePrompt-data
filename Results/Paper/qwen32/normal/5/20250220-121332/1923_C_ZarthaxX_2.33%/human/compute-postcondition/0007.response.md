The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9)
- `nums` is a list of integers read from input
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for the specific `i` being updated

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for the specific `i` being updated; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**
