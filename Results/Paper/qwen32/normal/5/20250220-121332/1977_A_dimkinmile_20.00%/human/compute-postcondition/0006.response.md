Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It likely performs some operation based on predefined values or user input within its body, and returns a result. Specifically, given `t` test cases where each test case consists of integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 <= n, m <= 100), the function returns a result for each test case. However, without specific details on the operations performed, the exact nature of the return value for each case is not specified.**
