Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. According to the problem, in each move, Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube. This means that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` should be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes (since each pair of an addition and a removal results in no net change).

However, the given program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the parity (evenness or oddness) of the difference `n - m`. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program would print "No" because `n < m`, but it is actually possible to end up with 4 cubes by adding a cube twice. Conversely, if `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the program would print "Yes", but it is not possible to end up with 2 cubes because the difference `n - m` is odd, and there would be one move left that could not be paired to result in the exact number of cubes.

The correct logic should be to check if `n - m` is non-negative and even, or if `n - m` is negative and odd (which would mean it's impossible to reach exactly `m` cubes). However, the program does not implement this logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
