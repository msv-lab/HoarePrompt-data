The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) and their constraints, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`. It directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
