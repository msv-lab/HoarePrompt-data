The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n is the number of moves Nikita can make and m is the desired number of cubes in the tower.
