The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is not influenced by the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `n` is less than `m`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('No')` statement is executed.
   - The string `'No'` is output to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`, the output is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
