Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution based on the problem description. The key observation is that Alice wins if and only if the number of facing-up coins ('U') is odd. This is because each move flips two adjacent coins, preserving the parity of the number of 'U's. If the number of 'U's is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of 'U's, and vice versa. Since the game must end with no 'U's left, the player who starts with an odd number of 'U's will be the last to make a move and thus win the game. The program counts the number of 'U's in the input string for each test case and appends 'yes' to the results if the count is odd, and 'no' otherwise.
