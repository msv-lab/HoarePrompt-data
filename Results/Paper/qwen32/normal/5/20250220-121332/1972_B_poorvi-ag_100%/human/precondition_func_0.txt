The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
