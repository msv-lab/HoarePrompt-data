Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds an integer value obtained from the input. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `results` remain unchanged.
