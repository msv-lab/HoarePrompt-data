Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `i` is 1; `results` is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, and now it also contains an additional 'yes'; `n` is the integer input from the user; `arr` is the string input from the user.**

In natural language: The list `results` now contains an additional string 'yes' appended to it. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
