The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `results` being an empty list does not affect whether the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted in terms of ensuring the loop's execution.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is the loop variable that will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `results` is an empty list**
