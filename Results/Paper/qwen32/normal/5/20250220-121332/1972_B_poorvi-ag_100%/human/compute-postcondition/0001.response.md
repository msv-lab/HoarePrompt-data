The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect the value of `t`, which remains an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `results` is an empty list.**
