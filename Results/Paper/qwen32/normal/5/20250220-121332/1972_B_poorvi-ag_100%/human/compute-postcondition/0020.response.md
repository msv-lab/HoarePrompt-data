The code snippet appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Therefore, the list `results` will now have one additional element `'no'` at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `results` is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, and now includes an additional 'no'; `n` is the integer input from the user; `arr` is the new string input from the user.**
