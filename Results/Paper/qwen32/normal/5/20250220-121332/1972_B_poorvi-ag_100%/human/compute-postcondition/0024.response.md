Given the initial state, we know that `results` is a list containing at least one string, where each string is either 'yes' or 'no'. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state or the provided code snippet. Since `i` is not defined, attempting to print `i` will result in a `NameError`.

To provide a precise answer based on the information given, we must acknowledge that the variable `i` is not defined. Therefore, the code will not execute successfully, and an error will be raised.

However, since the task is to determine what will be printed and the precondition does not define `i`, we can infer that the output will be an error message. But strictly following the format and the task requirements, we should state that the output is undefined due to the missing variable `i`.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
