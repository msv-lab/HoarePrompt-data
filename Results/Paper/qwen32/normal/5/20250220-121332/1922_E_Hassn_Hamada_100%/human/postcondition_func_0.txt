The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` between 1 and 1000 and a list of integers `sequence` where each integer is between 2 and \(10^{18}\). The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending additional integers based on the value of `number`. Regardless of the input, the function always returns the tuple (0, 0).
