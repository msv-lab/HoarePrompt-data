To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```

Let's break down the condition:

1. **`size`**: This is `max(sequence, default=0)`, meaning it is the maximum value in the `sequence` list. Since the `sequence` list has at least one integer, `size` is at least 2 (as each integer \(X\) in `sequence` satisfies \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\)).

2. **`i`**: This is `max(sequence, default=0) - 1`, so it is one less than `size`.

3. **`number`**: This is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{number} \leq 1000\).

The condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` can be simplified as:

\[ 2^{size + 1} - 2^i \leq number \]

Since \( i = size - 1 \), we can substitute \( i \):

\[ 2^{size + 1} - 2^{size - 1} \leq number \]

\[ 2^{size + 1} - \frac{2^{size}}{2} \leq number \]

\[ 2^{size + 1} - 2^{size - 1} \leq number \]

\[ 2^{size} \cdot 2 - 2^{size - 1} \leq number \]

\[ 2^{size} \cdot 2 - \frac{2^{size}}{2} \leq number \]

\[ 2^{size} \cdot (2 - \frac{1}{2}) \leq number \]

\[ 2^{size} \cdot \frac{3}{2} \leq number \]

\[ 2^{size} \cdot 1.5 \leq number \]

To ensure the loop can execute, we need \( number \) to be at least \( 2^{size} \cdot 1.5 \). Given that `number` is an integer between 1 and 1000, we must ensure that \( 2^{size} \cdot 1.5 \leq 1000 \).

Let's find the maximum possible value of `size`:

\[ 2^{size} \cdot 1.5 \leq 1000 \]

\[ 2^{size} \leq \frac{1000}{1.5} \]

\[ 2^{size} \leq \frac{2000}{3} \approx 666.67 \]

The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 666.67 is \( 2^{9} = 512 \). Therefore, the maximum possible value for `size` is 9. This means `size` must be at most 9.

Given these constraints, the state needs to be adjusted such that:

- `size` is at most 9.
- `number` is at least \( 2^{size} \cdot 1.5 \).

Since `size` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, the maximum value in `sequence` must be at most 9. Therefore, the `sequence` list must contain integers such that the maximum value is at most 9.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`number` is an integer such that \( 2^{size} \cdot 1.5 \leq \text{number} \leq 1000 \), `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer \(X\) in `sequence` satisfies \(2 \leq X \leq 9\), `size` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, `i` is `max(sequence, default=0) - 1`, `value` is \(2^{max(sequence, default=0) - 1}\)**

This ensures that the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` can be satisfied for the first iteration of the loop.
