Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2^{size + 2} - 2^i \leq \text{number} \leq 1000\); `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer \(X\) in `sequence` satisfies \(2 \leq X \leq 9\); `size` is `max(sequence, default=0) + 3`; `i` is `max(sequence, default=0) - 1`; `value` is \(2^{size} - 2^{i}\)**

Explanation: The `size` variable is incremented by 1, so the new value of `size` is `max(sequence, default=0) + 3`. This change affects the range for `number` since it now depends on the new `size` value. The other variables remain unchanged.
