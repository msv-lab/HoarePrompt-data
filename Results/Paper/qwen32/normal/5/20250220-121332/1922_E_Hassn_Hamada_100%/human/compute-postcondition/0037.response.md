The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range function's parameters, which are `max(sequence, default=0)` and `-1`. Since the loop iterates in reverse (from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `0`), we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration.

Given that the loop iterates from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `0` with a step of `-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev - 1`.

So, we need to decrement `i` by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`size` is \(\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << (i - 1))) - 1 \rceil\), `value` is \(2^{\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << (i - 1))) - 1 \rceil} - (1 << (i - 1))\), `i` is \(i - 1\)**

However, since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can just express the next state in terms of `i` as follows:

State: **`size` is \(\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << (i - 1))) - 1 \rceil\), `value` is \(2^{\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << (i - 1))) - 1 \rceil} - (1 << (i - 1))\), `i` is \(i - 1\)**

But since only `i` can be adjusted directly in the loop head, the final adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is \(i - 1\)**
