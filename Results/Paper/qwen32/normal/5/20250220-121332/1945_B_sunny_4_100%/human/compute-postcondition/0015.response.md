The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here, `a` and `b` represent the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` represents the visibility duration of each firework. There are `t` such test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided.

For each test case, the function evaluates the given frequencies and visibility duration and returns a result based on these inputs. However, the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to process each test case with the given parameters and return a result for each.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively.
