Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and then adds 2, which is incorrect.

The problem requires considering the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping visibility periods and then calculating the number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
6 7 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
5
```

Explanation for the counterexample:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times 0, 6, 12, 18, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times 0, 7, 14, 21, ...
- For `m = 4`, the fireworks launched at time 0 are visible from 0 to 4.
- The fireworks launched at time 6 are visible from 6 to 10.
- The fireworks launched at time 7 are visible from 7 to 11.
- Only two fireworks can be seen at the same time (at time 0 and time 7).

The program incorrectly calculates the result as 5, which is not the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
