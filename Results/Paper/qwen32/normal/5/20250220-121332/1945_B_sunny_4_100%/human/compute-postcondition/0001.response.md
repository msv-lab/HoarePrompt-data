The code snippet provided is:

```python
t = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain the same. The values of `A` and `B` are calculated as `int(m/a) + 1` and `int(m/b) + 1` respectively. The sum `A + B` is printed. However, since the code snippet provided does not affect `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, `B`, or the print statement, these parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

The only change is the introduction of the variable `t` which is assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain the same; `A` and `B` are calculated as `int(m/a) + 1` and `int(m/b) + 1` respectively; the sum `A + B` is printed.**
