Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect.

The program calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2`. This logic does not correctly account for the overlaps between the visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a time `x` such that the number of fireworks visible at that time is maximized. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and checking the visibility of fireworks at multiples of the LCM up to `m`.

The correct approach would be:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Iterate over the multiples of the LCM up to `m` and count the number of fireworks visible at each time.
3. Keep track of the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time.

Given the complexity and the large input constraints, a more efficient approach involves using mathematical properties of LCM and visibility periods.

The provided program does not implement this correct approach, and thus the logic is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
