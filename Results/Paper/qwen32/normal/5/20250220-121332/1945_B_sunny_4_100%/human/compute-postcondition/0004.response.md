The variable `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, and `A` and `B` are still calculated as `int(m/a) + 1` and `int(m/b) + 1` respectively based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new values read from the input, `A` is `int(m/a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m/b) + 1`, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`.**
