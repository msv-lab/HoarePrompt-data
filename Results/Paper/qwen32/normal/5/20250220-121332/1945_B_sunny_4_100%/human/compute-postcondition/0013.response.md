To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the computation of the variable `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it's part of the initial state).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are new values read from the input.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m/a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m/b) + 1`.
- `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`.
- `qi` is 0 (though `qi` is not used in the provided code snippet, it's part of the initial state).

### Calculation of `ans`:
- `m // a` computes the integer division of `m` by `a`.
- `m // b` computes the integer division of `m` by `b`.
- `ans` is the sum of these two integer divisions plus 2.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is computed as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of the variables.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m // a is the integer division of m by a, m // b is the integer division of m by b, and m, a, b are the input values)**
