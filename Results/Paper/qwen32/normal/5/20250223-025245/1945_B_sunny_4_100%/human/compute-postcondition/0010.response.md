The only variable in the loop head is `qi`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `qi` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `qi` is `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `qi` must be incremented by 1, but since `qi` is already equal to `t`, the loop will not execute again if we simply increment `qi`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `qi` is less than `t` at the start of the next iteration.

Since `qi` is the loop variable and `t` is the upper limit, at the start of the next iteration, `qi` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value (which was `t-1`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input; `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`; `qi` is `t-1`**
