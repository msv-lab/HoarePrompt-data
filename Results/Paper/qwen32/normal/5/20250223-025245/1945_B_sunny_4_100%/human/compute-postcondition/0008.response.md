The code snippet provided does not change the value of `ans` because `ans` is already defined with the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` before the code snippet. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains the same after the code snippet executes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input; `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`; `qi` is `t`**
