The code reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input.**
