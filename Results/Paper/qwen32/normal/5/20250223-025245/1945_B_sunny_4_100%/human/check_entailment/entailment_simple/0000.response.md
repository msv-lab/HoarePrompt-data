Reasoning:  
The given program is attempting to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. However, the calculation logic in the program is incorrect. The current implementation calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2`, which does not accurately reflect the number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To correctly determine the number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the times at which fireworks from both installations are visible and overlap. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping intervals and then calculating the number of fireworks visible within those intervals.

The current logic does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly. Therefore, the provided program will not yield the correct results for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
