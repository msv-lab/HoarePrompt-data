The code snippet `t = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means the initial value of `t` (which was an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is replaced by the new input value. 

Since the input value is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that after the execution, `t` will hold the value provided by the user, which is also an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, as provided by the user input.**
