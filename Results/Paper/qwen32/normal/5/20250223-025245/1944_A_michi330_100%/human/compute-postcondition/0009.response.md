The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the new input provided. The initial state specifies that `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` have specific values or conditions, but the code only affects `n` and `k`. After executing the code, `n` and `k` are assigned the new integer values from the input, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
