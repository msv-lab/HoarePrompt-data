Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on the observation that if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, Everule will be unable to reach any island other than island 1. This is because destroying `n - 1` bridges will isolate island 1 from all other islands, as each island needs at least one bridge to be connected to island 1 directly or indirectly.

However, if Dominater can destroy fewer than `n - 1` bridges, Everule will still be able to reach all `n` islands. This is because destroying fewer than `n - 1` bridges will not be sufficient to disconnect island 1 from the rest of the islands, given the initial fully connected graph.

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of islands) and `k` (the number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
- It then checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, it prints `1` (indicating Everule can only reach island 1). Otherwise, it prints `n` (indicating Everule can reach all islands).

The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior of the program based on the described logic.

Correctness: **True**
