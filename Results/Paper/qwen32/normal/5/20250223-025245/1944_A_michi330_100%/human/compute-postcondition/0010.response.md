The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `k` as defined in the initial state. The print statement is hardcoded to output `1`.

Here is the breakdown of the variables mentioned in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from a new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- There is a condition that checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, but this condition does not affect the output of the `print(1)` statement.

Since the print statement is `print(1)`, it will always output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
