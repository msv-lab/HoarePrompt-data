Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the unchanged state of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` after the if-else block, with the condition on `k` relative to `n - 1` preserved.
