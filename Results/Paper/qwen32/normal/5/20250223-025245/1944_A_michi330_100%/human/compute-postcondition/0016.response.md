To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is the first integer from a new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the same new input.
- There is a condition: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement is `print(n)`, which means it will print the value of `n`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- The value of `i` is set to 2 but is also not used in the print statement.
- The value of `n` is directly printed.
- The value of `k` is not used in the print statement.

Since the print statement is `print(n)`, it will output the value of `n` as it is the only variable involved in the print statement.

### Output:
Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the new input)**
