Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`. For each iteration, `n` and `k` are read from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the program will have processed `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)`. For each pair, it will have printed either `1` or `n` based on the condition `k >= n - 1`. The initial value of `t` will still be the same and valid within the specified range.
