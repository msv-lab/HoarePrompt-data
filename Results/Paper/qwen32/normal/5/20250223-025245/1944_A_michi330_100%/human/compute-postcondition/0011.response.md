Let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- There is a condition: if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is considered to be greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is considered to be less than `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- The print statement directly outputs the value of `n`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n`, which is the first integer from the new input.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the new input)**
