You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the list of stick lengths a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a list of integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of each unique integer in `a` is stored.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of each unique integer in `a` is stored.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for all x in cnt.values())
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, where 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the lengths of the sticks, where each length satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given stick lengths.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
