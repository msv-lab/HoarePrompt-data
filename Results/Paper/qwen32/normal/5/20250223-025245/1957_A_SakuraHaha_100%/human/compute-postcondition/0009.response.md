The code snippet `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. If `x` is not already a key in `cnt`, it is added with a count of 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cnt` because the count of `x` is updated. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1; `x` is `a[i+1]` where `a[i]` was the previous `x`.**
