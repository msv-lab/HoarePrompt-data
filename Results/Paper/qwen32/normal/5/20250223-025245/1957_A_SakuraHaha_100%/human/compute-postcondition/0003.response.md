The code snippet `cnt = dict()` initializes a new empty dictionary named `cnt`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**
