Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `ans` is `ans` + `x` // 3, `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of each unique integer in `a` is stored and must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `x // 3` to it, where `x` is the next value in the dictionary `cnt.values()`. All other variables remain unchanged.
