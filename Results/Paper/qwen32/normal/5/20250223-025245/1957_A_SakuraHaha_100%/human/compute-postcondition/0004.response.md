The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ans`, and `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is an empty dictionary**
