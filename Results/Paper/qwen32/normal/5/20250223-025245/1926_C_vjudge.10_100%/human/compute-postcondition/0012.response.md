The code updates the value at index `i` in the list `values` by adding the value at index `i-1` to `sum_value_digits`. Given the initial state, `values[i - 1]` is `values[0]`, which is `0`, and `sum_value_digits` is `t`. Therefore, `values[1]` becomes `0 + t`, which is `t`.

The values of `t`, `inf`, `i`, and `sum_value_digits` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t`, `i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is `t`.**
