Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the function definition and placement. The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`. This is a syntax error and the program will not run as intended.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
func_1()

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])
```

To fix this, the function definition should come before the function call:
```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])

func_1()
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for the given problem description and all test cases. However, the original code as provided is incorrect due to the syntax error mentioned.
