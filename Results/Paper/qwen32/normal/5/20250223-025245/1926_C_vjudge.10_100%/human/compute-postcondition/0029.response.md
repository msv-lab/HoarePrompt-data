The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string representation of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 200000, and `x` is '2'. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is 200000, its string representation is "200000". The loop has already processed the first character '2', so now it should process the next character '0'.

Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to be the next character in the string representation of `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `final_sum_value_digits`, `i` is 200000, `sum_value_digits` is 4, `x` is '0'**
