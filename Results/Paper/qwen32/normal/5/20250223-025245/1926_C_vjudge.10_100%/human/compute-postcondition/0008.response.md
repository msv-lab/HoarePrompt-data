The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments the value of `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Since `sum_value_digits` was initially set to `int(x)`, after the execution of this line, `sum_value_digits` will be `int(x) + int(x)`, which is `2 * int(x)`.

The other variables (`t`, `inf`, `values`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is `2 * int(x)`**.
