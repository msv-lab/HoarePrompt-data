Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case. `inf` is 200001.**

Explanation: The value of `inf` has been set to 200001, which is 2 * 10^5 + 1. All other variables and initial conditions remain unchanged.
