Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string for each test case and prints this difference. However, the task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the described splitting process and penalty calculation rules.

The program does not perform any splitting of the array or calculate penalties according to the rules specified. Instead, it simply computes the net count of '+' and '-' characters, which is unrelated to the required minimum penalty calculation.

Correctness: **False**
