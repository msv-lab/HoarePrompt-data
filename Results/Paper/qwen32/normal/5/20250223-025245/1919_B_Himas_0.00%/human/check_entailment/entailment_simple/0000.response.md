Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array derived from the string `s` into subarrays in an optimal way. The penalty for each subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The program, however, simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints this difference. This does not address the requirement to find the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the total penalty.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty, which is significantly more complex than just counting the number of '+' and '-' characters.

Correctness: **False**
