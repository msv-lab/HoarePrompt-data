Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. For each test case, the function returns the final count after processing the string, where each '+' increases the count by 1 and each '-' decreases the count by 1.**
