The code snippet `s = int(input())` changes the value of `s` to whatever integer is input by the user. All other variables (`P`, `M`, `i`, and `e`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`P` is the count of '+' in `e`, `M` is the count of non-'+' in `e`, `i` is `i` + len(`e`), `s` is an input integer, `e` remains the input string.**
