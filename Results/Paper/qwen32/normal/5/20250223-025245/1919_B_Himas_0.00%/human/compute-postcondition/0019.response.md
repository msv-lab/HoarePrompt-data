To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the variables `P` and `M` are updated based on the input string `e`.

The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', `P` is incremented by 1. If `q` is not '+', `M` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 (this variable is not used in the loop and remains unchanged).
- `s` is an input integer (this variable is not used in the loop and remains unchanged).
- `e` is the input string consisting of characters.
- `P` is initialized to 0.
- `M` is initialized to 0.

The final output state after all iterations will be:
- `P` will be the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` will be the count of characters in the string `e` that are not '+'.

Since the loop processes each character in `e` exactly once, the final values of `P` and `M` will reflect the counts of '+' and non-'+' characters, respectively.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in `e`.**
