The only variable in the loop head is `q`, and it is being iterated over the elements of the list `e`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in `e`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is the next element in `e`.
- If `q` is '+', then `P` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `M` is incremented by 1.

We need to adjust the state based on the loop head variable `q` for the next iteration. Since `q` is the current element being processed, the next iteration will process the subsequent element in `e`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `q` is the current element, and it has already been processed to either increment `P` or `M`.

For the next iteration:
- `q` should be the next element in the list `e`.

Since we do not have specific information about the elements in `e` or the current position of `q` in `e`, we can only express the state in terms of the next element in `e`.

State: **`q` is the next element in `e`**.
