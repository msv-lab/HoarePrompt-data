You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not consider the robot's ability to move up and down between the two rows. The logic only checks if the robot can move right along the arrows in each row, but it does not account for the possibility of moving up or down to switch rows based on the arrows.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
The robot can follow this path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2)
3. Move down to (2, 2)
4. Move right to (2, 3)
5. Move up to (1, 3)
6. Move right to (1, 4)
7. Move down to (2, 4)

However, the provided program will output "NO" for this input because it does not account for the possibility of moving up and down between the rows.

Here's a modified version of the program that correctly handles the movement between rows:

```python
def can_reach_end(test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, (row1, row2) in test_cases:
        # Initialize a set to keep track of visited positions
        visited = set()
        # Start at position (1, 1)
        queue = [(1, 1)]
        visited.add((1, 1))
        while queue:
            r, c = queue.pop(0)
            # If we reach the target position (2, n), return 'YES'
            if (r, c) == (2, n):
                results.append('YES')
                break
            # Possible moves: left, right, up, down
            moves = []
            if c > 1:
                moves.append((r, c - 1))
            if c < n:
                moves.append((r, c + 1))
            if r == 1:
                moves.append((2, c))
            if r == 2:
                moves.append((1, c))
            # After moving, follow the arrow
            for nr, nc in moves:
                if (nr, nc) not in visited:
                    visited.add((nr, nc))
                    if nr == 1 and row1[nc - 1] == '>':
                        queue.append((nr, nc + 1))
                    elif nr == 1 and row1[nc - 1] == '<':
                        queue.append((nr, nc - 1))
                    elif nr == 2 and row2[nc - 1] == '>':
                        queue.append((nr, nc + 1))
                    elif nr == 2 and row2[nc - 1] == '<':
                        queue.append((nr, nc - 1))
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = can_reach_end(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This modified program correctly handles the movement between rows and follows the arrows as described in the problem statement. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible paths the robot can take.
