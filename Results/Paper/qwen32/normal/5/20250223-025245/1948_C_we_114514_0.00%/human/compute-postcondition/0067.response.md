Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is False. Additionally, `row1[j]` is not equal to `'>'`. The current value of `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` equals `'>'`.**
