The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False**
