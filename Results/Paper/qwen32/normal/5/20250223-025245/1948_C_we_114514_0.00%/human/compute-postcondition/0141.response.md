The code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `results` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is not affected by this code snippet as the condition for modifying `j` relates to the value of `reachable_second_row` which is being set in this line.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `results` contains `'NO'`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`.**
