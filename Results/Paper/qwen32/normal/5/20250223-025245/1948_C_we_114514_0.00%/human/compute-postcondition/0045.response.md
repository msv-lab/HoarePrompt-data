The code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This change affects only the `reachable_second_row` variable, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_first_row` is True or False based on previous conditions, `reachable_second_row` is True**.
