The only object in the loop head is `test_case` from the iterable `test_cases`. To ensure that the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. According to the problem description, `test_cases` is not explicitly mentioned in the state before the loop starts, but we can infer that it must be a list or some iterable containing test cases.

Each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`. To meet the requirements of the problem, we need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one such test case.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list**
