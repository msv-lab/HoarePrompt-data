Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `results` contains `'NO'`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`. The values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, `results`, and `j` remain unchanged.
