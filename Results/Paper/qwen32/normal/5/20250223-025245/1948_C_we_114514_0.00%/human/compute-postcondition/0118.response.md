Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains `False`. Additionally, `row1[j]` is `'>'`.**
