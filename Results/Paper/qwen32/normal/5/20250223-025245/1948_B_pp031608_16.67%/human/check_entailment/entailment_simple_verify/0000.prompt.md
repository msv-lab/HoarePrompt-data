You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of lst is between 2 and 50 inclusive. This list represents the array a for a single test case, with the first element of lst being the integer n (the length of the array), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description in all cases. Let's analyze the code and find a potential issue.

The main logic of the program is inside the loop that iterates through the list elements. It attempts to split an element if it is greater than 10 and the list is not sorted. However, the logic is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program splits the number into two digits by integer division and modulo operations, but this approach does not correctly split numbers with more than two digits. For example, the number 123 should be split into [1, 2, 3], but the code will only split it into [12, 3].

2. **Inefficient and Incomplete Check**: The program checks if the list is sorted using the `func_1` function. If the list is not sorted, it attempts to split the previous element. However, this approach is not sufficient to guarantee that the list will become sorted. The program does not consider all possible splits and does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from the second element to the end of the list. If an element needs to be split, it modifies the list, but the loop index does not account for the new elements that are inserted. This can lead to skipping elements or incorrect comparisons.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the list is already sorted or where the list cannot be sorted by any number of splits.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the failure:

**Example:**

Input:
```
1
4
123 4 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- The number 123 can be split into [1, 2, 3].
- The resulting list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is sorted.

However, the provided program will not handle this case correctly because it cannot split 123 into [1, 2, 3] using the current logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
