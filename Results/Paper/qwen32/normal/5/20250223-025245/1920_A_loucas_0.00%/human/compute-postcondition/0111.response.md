Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is a valid integer (e.g., 0), `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `loop` remains unchanged, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing the input integer `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
