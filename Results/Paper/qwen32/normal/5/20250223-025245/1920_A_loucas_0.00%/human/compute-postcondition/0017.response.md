Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the integer `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
