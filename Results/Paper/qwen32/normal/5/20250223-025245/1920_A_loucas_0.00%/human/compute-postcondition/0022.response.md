Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the integer `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, and `big` and `less` are empty lists. `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`.**

Explanation:
The code snippet `no.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the `no` list. If `x` was not 1 or 2, `no` initially contained the value of `a` once. After executing the code, `no` now contains the value of `a` twice. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
