To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand how the variable `num` is defined.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Ranges and Lists:**
   - `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1.
   - `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2.
   - `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.

2. **Determining the Range:**
   - The range for `num` is defined from `max(big)` to `min(less)`. This means `num` will be a value starting from the maximum value in `big` up to, but not including, the minimum value in `less`.

3. **Finding `num`:**
   - `num` is the first value `i` in the range `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, or `0` if no such value exists.
   - This implies that `num` will be the smallest number in the range `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not present in the `no` list.

4. **Special Case:**
   - If no such value exists in the specified range (i.e., all values in the range are in `no`), then `num` is set to `0`.

### Output Description:
- The `print(num)` statement will print the value of `num` as determined by the above rules.
- Since the exact values of `big`, `less`, and `no` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `num`. However, we can describe its value based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **num (where num is the first value in the range from max(big) to min(less) that is not in no, or 0 if no such value exists)**
