Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `loop` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `loop` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value of the input provided. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was already defined in the initial state.
