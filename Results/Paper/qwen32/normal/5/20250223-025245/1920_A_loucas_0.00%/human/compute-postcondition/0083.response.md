Output State: **`num` is `i`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` remains unchanged, `big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, and `max(big) < min(less)`. Additionally, `i` is not in the list `no` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables `num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `big`, `less`, `i`, or `no`. The conditions provided in the initial state remain valid after the execution of the `break` statement.
