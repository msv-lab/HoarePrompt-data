Postcondition: **`num` is `i` if `i` is not in the list `no`; otherwise, `num` remains 0. `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `loop` and `innerLoop` remain unchanged. `big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, and `max(big) < min(less)`. If `i` is not in `no`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
