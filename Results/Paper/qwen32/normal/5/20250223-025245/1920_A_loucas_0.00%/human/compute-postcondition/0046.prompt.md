Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing all integers `a` that were paired with `x` equal to 1. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing all integers `a` that were paired with `x` equal to 2. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing all integers `a` that were paired with `x` not equal to 1 or 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer, `less` is a list containing at least one integer such that `max(big) < min(less)`. If `i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `num`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer, `less` is a list containing at least one integer such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 1`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to `max(big) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer, `less` is a list containing at least one integer such that `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is `max(big) + 2`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to `max(big) + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
