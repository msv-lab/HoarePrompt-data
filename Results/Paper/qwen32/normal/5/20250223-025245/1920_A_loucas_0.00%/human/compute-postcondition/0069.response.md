The code snippet `no.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `no`. Therefore, the list `no` will now include the value of `a` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than `iterable2`, `iterable2` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big`, `less`, and `no` are initialized based on the new value of `x`, `no` includes `a` as its last element.**
