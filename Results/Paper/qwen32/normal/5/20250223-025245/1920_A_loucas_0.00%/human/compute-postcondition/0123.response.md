The code snippet `no.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `no`. 

Given the initial state, `no` already contains `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2. However, regardless of the initial condition, `no` includes `a` if `x` is not 2. Therefore, after executing `no.append(a)`, `no` will contain `a` at least twice if `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `x` is 1 or 2, `no` will contain `a` exactly once after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is a valid integer, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, and `no` is a list containing `a` at least once and possibly more times if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `iterable2` is 1.**
