Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `loop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
        if i not in no:
            num = i
            break
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num is set to the first integer in the range [max(big), min(less)) that is not in no, or 0 if no such integer exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is the first value `i` in the range `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`, or `num` remains 0 if no such value exists. `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `loop` and `innerLoop` remain unchanged. `big`, `less`, and `no` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is the first value `i` in the range `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, or `0` if no such value exists; `iterable` is a valid integer, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is a valid integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
