You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers where the first element represents the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements represent stick lengths. It calculates the sum of how many complete sets of three can be formed from each unique stick length and returns this sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from given sticks. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

The logic in the function `func_1` is as follows:
- It creates a frequency dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
- It then calculates the sum of `v // 3` for each value `v` in `freq.values()`, which represents the number of polygons that could be formed if each polygon required exactly 3 sticks of the same length.

However, the problem statement does not specify that each polygon must have exactly 3 sides (i.e., be a triangle). A regular polygon can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the logic should account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Count the frequency of each stick length.
2. For each unique stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of that stick by the smallest possible number of sides for a polygon (which is 3) and taking the integer part of the division.
3. Sum these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.

The provided function incorrectly assumes that all polygons must have exactly 3 sides, which is not the case according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
