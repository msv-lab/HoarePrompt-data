The code snippet `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` updates the dictionary `freq` by incrementing the count of the key `n`. If `n` is not already a key in the dictionary, `freq.get(n, 0)` returns 0, and thus `freq[n]` is set to 1. If `n` is already a key, its value is incremented by 1.

Given that the initial state does not specify the value of `n`, we can only describe the outcome in terms of `n`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and its value incremented by 1.**
