Reasoning:
The given program is not correct based on the problem description. The program is supposed to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. However, the current implementation of the `func_1` function incorrectly assumes that each regular polygon must be a triangle (i.e., it divides the frequency of each stick length by 3). 

The problem does not specify that the polygons must be triangles. Regular polygons can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the program should consider forming polygons with various numbers of sides, not just triangles. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible polygon sides (from 3 to the maximum frequency of any stick length) and determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed. The current implementation does not account for this flexibility in the number of sides of the polygons.

Correctness: **False**
