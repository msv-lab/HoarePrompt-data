The code snippet increments the value associated with the key `n` in the `freq` dictionary by 1. If `n` is not already a key in `freq`, it is added with a value of 1.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases.
- `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and its value incremented by 1.
- `n` is `arr[2]`.

After executing `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1`:
- The value of `freq[n]` is incremented by 1. If `n` was not in `freq`, it is now added with a value of 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases; `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and its value incremented by 1; `n` is `arr[2]`.**
