Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed. The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that any group of 3 sticks of the same length can form a polygon. This is not true for polygons with more than 3 sides. For example, a square requires 4 sticks of the same length, a pentagon requires 5 sticks of the same length, and so on.

Let's consider a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation: We can form one hexagon (6-sided polygon) using all 6 sticks of length 2.

Actual Output:
```
2
```
Explanation: The program calculates `2` because `6 // 3 = 2`, but it should calculate `1` because we can only form one hexagon (6-sided polygon) with 6 sticks.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
