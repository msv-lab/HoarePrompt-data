The code increments the value associated with the key `n` in the dictionary `freq` by 1. If `n` is not already a key in `freq`, it is added with a value of 1.

Given that `n` is `arr[3]`, the value of `freq[n]` will be incremented by 1. The values of `arr` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases; `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and its value incremented by 1; `n` is `arr[3]`.**
