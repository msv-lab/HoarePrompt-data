The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the code snippet.
4. Since the string `'YES'` is directly specified, there is no need to consider the values of `t`, `n`, or `m` for this particular `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
