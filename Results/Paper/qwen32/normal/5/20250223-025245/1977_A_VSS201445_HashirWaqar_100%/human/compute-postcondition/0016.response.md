Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the input function. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference (`n - m`) is even, the conditions of the if part are met. Otherwise, the conditions of the else part are met, but in both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
