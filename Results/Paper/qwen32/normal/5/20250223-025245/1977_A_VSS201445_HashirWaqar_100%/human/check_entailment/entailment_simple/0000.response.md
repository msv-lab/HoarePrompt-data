### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing exactly one cube.

The logic in the provided program is as follows:
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n` (the number of moves) is at least `m` (the desired number of cubes).
- It also checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because:
  - If `n - m` is even, it means that the number of "extra" moves (after reaching `m` cubes) can be split evenly between adding and removing cubes, which would result in ending up with `m` cubes.
  - If `n - m` is odd, it means there will be one leftover move that cannot be paired (either an extra addition or removal), which would result in not having exactly `m` cubes.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. Let's verify it with the example given:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is `True` (3 >= 3).
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `True` ((3 - 3) % 2 == 0).
   - The output is "YES", which is correct.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n >= m` is `False` (2 < 4).
   - The output is "NO", which is correct because `n` is less than `m`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n >= m` is `True` (5 >= 3).
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `True` ((5 - 3) % 2 == 0).
   - The output is "YES", which is correct.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Correctness: **True**
