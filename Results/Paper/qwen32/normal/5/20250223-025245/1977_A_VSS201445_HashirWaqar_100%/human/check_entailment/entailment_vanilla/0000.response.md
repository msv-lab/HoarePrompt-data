Reasoning:

To determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the nature of the moves he can make:

1. Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube per move.
2. This means that after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer from `-n` to `n` (if we consider the possibility of starting with 0 cubes and removing cubes, although in this problem, we start from 0 and can't have a negative number of cubes).

The key observation is that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must be even. This is because:

- Each "add a cube" move and each "remove a cube" move changes the number of cubes by 1.
- To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect of these moves must be to change the number of cubes from 0 to `m`.
- If `m` is to be reached after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even, because each pair of an "add" and a "remove" (or vice versa) cancels out to a net change of 0, and any remaining moves must either all be "add" or all be "remove" to reach `m`.

Given this, the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` in the provided program is almost correct, but it misses a crucial point: `n` can be less than `m` if `m` is 0 (since we can't have a negative number of cubes). However, the problem specifies that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, so `m` can never be 0, and thus `n >= m` is a valid condition.

Therefore, the program correctly checks if it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves by ensuring that `n` is at least `m` and that the difference `n - m` is even.

Correctness: **True**
