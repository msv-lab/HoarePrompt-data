### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the program step-by-step to ensure we fully understand the logic and correctness.

**Problem Recap:**
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- For each test case, output "Yes" if possible, "No" otherwise.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

**Key Points:**
1. **Condition `n >= m`:**
   - This condition ensures that the number of moves `n` is sufficient to reach `m` cubes, either by adding or removing cubes.
   - **Correctness:** This condition is indeed correct. If `n < m`, it's impossible to reach `m` cubes because we can only add or remove one cube per move.

2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (an odd number). To end up with an exact number of cubes `m` after `n` moves, the number of net additions (or removals) must be even.
   - **Correctness:** This condition is also correct. If `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, it means the number of moves is insufficient to balance out to exactly `m` cubes.

**Counterexample Analysis:**
- The original assessment mentioned a counterexample with input `1\n3 1`, expecting "Yes" but getting "NO".
- Let's analyze this:
  - `n = 3` and `m = 1`.
  - `n >= m` is `True`.
  - `(n - m) % 2 == (3 - 1) % 2 == 0` is `True`.
  - The program should output "YES", which it does in this case.
  - The original assessment incorrectly identified this as a failure because it didn't consider the case where `n > m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` correctly.

**Edge Case Handling:**
- The program correctly handles the case where `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- When `n < m`, it is impossible to reach `m` cubes because we can only add or remove one cube per move, and the difference `m - n` would need to be even, but the condition `n >= m` already ensures this case is not incorrectly evaluated.

**Conclusion:**
- The program correctly handles all scenarios as per the problem description.
- The original assessment incorrectly identified a counterexample that the program actually handles correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
