The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of the `print` statement is not influenced by these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 100 inclusive.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input function, but they are not referenced in the code snippet.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`, the output will always be `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
