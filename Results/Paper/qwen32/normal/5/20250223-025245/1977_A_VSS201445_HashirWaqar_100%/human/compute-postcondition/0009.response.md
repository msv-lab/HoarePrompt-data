The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes `t`, `n`, and `m` as integers, with `t` having a specific range (1 to 100), and `n` and `m` being provided by the input function.
2. The `print('YES')` statement is independent of these variables as they are not referenced in the statement.
3. The `print` statement will execute and output the string `'YES'` exactly as specified.

Output: **YES**
