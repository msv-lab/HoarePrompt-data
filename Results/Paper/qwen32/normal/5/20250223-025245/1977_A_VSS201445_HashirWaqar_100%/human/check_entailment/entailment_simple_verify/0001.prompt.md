You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each of the `t` iterations, two integers `n` and `m` were provided, and the program printed 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference (`n - m`) is even, otherwise it printed 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the nature of the moves he can make:

1. Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube per move.
2. This means that after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer from `-n` to `n` (if we consider the possibility of starting with 0 cubes and removing cubes, although in this problem, we start from 0 and can't have a negative number of cubes).

The key observation is that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must be even. This is because:

- Each "add a cube" move and each "remove a cube" move changes the number of cubes by 1.
- To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect of these moves must be to change the number of cubes from 0 to `m`.
- If `m` is to be reached after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even, because each pair of an "add" and a "remove" (or vice versa) cancels out to a net change of 0, and any remaining moves must either all be "add" or all be "remove" to reach `m`.

Given this, the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` in the provided program is almost correct, but it misses a crucial point: `n` can be less than `m` if `m` is 0 (since we can't have a negative number of cubes). However, the problem specifies that `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, so `m` can never be 0, and thus `n >= m` is a valid condition.

Therefore, the program correctly checks if it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves by ensuring that `n` is at least `m` and that the difference `n - m` is even.

Correctness: **True**
