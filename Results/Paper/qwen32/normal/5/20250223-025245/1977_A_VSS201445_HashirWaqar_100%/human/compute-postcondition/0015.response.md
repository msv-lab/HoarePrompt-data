The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string `'NO'` directly.

Thus, the output of the code snippet is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
