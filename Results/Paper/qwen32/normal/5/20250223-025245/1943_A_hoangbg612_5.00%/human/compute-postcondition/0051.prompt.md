Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is the largest number in the contiguous sequence starting from -1 in N. If the sum of the counts of all numbers in M is equal to S, then `cur` is increased by 1, and M is a dictionary with counts of all numbers in this updated contiguous sequence. Otherwise, the sum of the counts of all numbers in M is not equal to S.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is greater than 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 0 and `M[i]` is greater than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is greater than 0 and `i` has been incremented by 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `cur` or `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is greater than `i + 1` before `i` was incremented, `i` is incremented by 1. If `M[i] <= i`, `cur` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
