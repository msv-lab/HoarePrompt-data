Output State: **`cur` is the largest number in the contiguous sequence starting from -1 in N plus 1, and M is a dictionary with counts of all numbers in this contiguous sequence. The sum of the counts of all numbers in M is equal to S.**

Natural language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, making it one more than the largest number in the contiguous sequence starting from -1 in N. The dictionary `M` and the sum `S` remain unchanged.
