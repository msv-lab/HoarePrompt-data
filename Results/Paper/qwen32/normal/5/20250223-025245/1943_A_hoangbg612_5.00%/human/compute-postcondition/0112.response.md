For the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head in the provided loop is `num in N`, which means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `N`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `N` has at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which will take each value from the list `N` in each iteration.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `N` is not empty because `num` will take each value from `N` in each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `cur` is -1.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `M` is an empty dictionary.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `N` is not empty. The other variables (`cur`, `T`, `S`, and `M`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop and hence do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cur` is -1, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary**.
