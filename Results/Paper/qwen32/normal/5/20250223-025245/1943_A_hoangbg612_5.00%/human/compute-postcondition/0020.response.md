The `break` statement will exit the current loop, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `num`, `cur`, and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is an integer incremented by 1, `M` is a dictionary, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
