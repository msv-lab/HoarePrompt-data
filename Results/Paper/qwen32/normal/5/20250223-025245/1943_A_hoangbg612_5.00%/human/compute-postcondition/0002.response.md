`S` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4, and `S` is the integer value provided by the input.
Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `S` is an input integer**
