Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after `num_next`. If `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `num_next` and `M[num_next]` is set to `1`, and `cur` is incremented by 1, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.**
