The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will iterate `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `T`.

Given that `T` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `T` is at least 1. The variables `t`, `n`, and the list `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4**
