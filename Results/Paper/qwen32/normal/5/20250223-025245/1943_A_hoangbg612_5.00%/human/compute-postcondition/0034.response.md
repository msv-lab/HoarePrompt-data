To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes the list `N`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `M` is initialized as an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `num` in `N`, the loop checks if `num` is greater than `cur`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to `1`.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.

### Understanding the Output State:
- The loop processes each element in the sorted list `N`.
- It updates `cur` to the current number if it is greater than `cur` and updates the dictionary `M` to reflect the count of each number encountered.
- The loop breaks if it encounters a number that is more than one unit greater than `cur`, indicating a gap in the sequence.

### Final Output State:
- After processing all elements in `N`, `cur` will be the largest number in `N` that is part of a contiguous sequence starting from the initial value of `cur` (which is `-1`).
- The dictionary `M` will contain keys corresponding to each unique number in the contiguous sequence from the start up to `cur`, with their respective counts.

### Example:
If `N = [0, 1, 2, 5, 6]`, the loop will:
- Set `cur` to `0` and `M` to `{0: 1}`.
- Set `cur` to `1` and `M` to `{0: 1, 1: 1}`.
- Set `cur` to `2` and `M` to `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}`.
- Encounter `5`, which is greater than `cur + 1` (3), so the loop breaks.

Thus, the final state will be:
- `cur` will be `2`.
- `M` will be `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}`.

### General Case:
Given the sorted list `N` and the initial state, the final state will be:
- `cur` will be the largest number in the contiguous sequence starting from `-1` in `N`.
- `M` will contain the counts of all numbers in this contiguous sequence.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **cur is the largest number in the contiguous sequence starting from -1 in N, and M is a dictionary with counts of all numbers in this contiguous sequence.**

In simpler terms:
- `cur` will be the highest number in `N` that is part of a continuous sequence starting from `-1`.
- `M` will have the count of each number in this continuous sequence.
