Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `N` that must have at least one more element, `cur` is an integer incremented by 1, and `M` is a dictionary; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `num`, `cur`, and `M` remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
