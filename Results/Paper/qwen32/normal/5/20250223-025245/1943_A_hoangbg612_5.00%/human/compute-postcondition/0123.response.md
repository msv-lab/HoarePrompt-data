The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` from the list `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must still have more elements to iterate over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the last element processed. Therefore, for the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in the list `N`.

Since `N` is a sorted list and must have at least one integer, and we have already processed one element, `N` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue. Let's denote the next element in `N` as `num_next`.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is `num_next`**
