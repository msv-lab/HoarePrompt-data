The code assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given that `cur` is initially set to `num`, this means that the key `num` in the dictionary `M` is now assigned the value `1`. The variables `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged, and `num` continues to be the next integer in the list `N`.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`; `T` remains unchanged; `S` remains unchanged; `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers; `num` is the next integer in the list `N`; `M[num]` is 1.**
