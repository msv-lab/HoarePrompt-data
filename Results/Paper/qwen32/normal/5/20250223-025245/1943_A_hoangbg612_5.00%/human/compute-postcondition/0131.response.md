The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least one more integer after the current `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is `num_next`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next integer in the list `N`.

Given that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, and `num` is currently `num_next`, the next integer in the list `N` will be the next element after `num_next`.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after `num_next`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num_next` and `M[num_next]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.**
