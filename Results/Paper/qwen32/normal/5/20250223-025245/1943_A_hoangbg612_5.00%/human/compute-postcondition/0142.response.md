Postcondition: **N is a sorted list of integers, cur is the last element of N incremented by 1 if the sum of the counts of all keys in M equals S, otherwise cur remains the last element of N. T remains unchanged, S remains unchanged, and M is a dictionary with each unique number in N as keys and their counts as values.**
