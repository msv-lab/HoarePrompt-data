The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `num`. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `M`) remain unchanged. The condition regarding the value of `cur` before the assignment does not affect the output state since the assignment overwrites `cur` regardless of its previous value.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`; `T` remains unchanged; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `M` is an empty dictionary.**
