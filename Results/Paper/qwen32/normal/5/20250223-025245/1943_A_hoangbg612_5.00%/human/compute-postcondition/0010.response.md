The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Since `num` was initially greater than `cur` and `num` is still greater than `cur + 1` after the increment, the precondition that `num` is greater than `cur` remains valid. The new value of `cur` is `cur + 1`.

Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur`, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**
