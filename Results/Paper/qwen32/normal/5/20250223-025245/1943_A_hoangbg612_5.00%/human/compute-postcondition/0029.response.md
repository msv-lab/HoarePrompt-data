Postcondition: **`num` is the next element in the list `N` that must have at least one more element, `cur` is an integer, and `M` is a dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` or `M`.**
