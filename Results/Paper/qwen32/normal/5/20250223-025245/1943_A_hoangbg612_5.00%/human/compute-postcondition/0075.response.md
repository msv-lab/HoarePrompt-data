The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given the initial state, `cur` is `num`. Therefore, the dictionary `M` will have the entry `{num: 1}` after the execution of the code. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}`**.
