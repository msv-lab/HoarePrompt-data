The value of `cur` is set to -1. The other variables `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is -1, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, and `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
