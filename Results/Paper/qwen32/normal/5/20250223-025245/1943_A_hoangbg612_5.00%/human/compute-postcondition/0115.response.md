The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur` was -1, so after the operation, `cur` becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cur` is 0, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `num` is greater than `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cur` is 0, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `num` is greater than 0.**
