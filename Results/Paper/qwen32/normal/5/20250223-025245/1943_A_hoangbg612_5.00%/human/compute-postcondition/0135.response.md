The value of `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after `num_next`, `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
