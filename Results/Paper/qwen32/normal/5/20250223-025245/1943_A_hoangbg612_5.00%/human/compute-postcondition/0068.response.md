The given code snippet attempts to increment the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. However, since `M` is initially an empty dictionary, `M[cur]` does not exist, and attempting to increment it using `M[cur] += 1` will result in a `KeyError`.

Given the constraints and the initial state, the code as written will raise an error and not execute as intended. Therefore, the state of the variables will not change from the initial state.

Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `num` is less than or equal to -1**.
