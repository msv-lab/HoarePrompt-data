The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to the variable `cur`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `cur` is now equal to the value of `num`. The other variables (`N`, `T`, `S`, and `M`) remain unchanged. The condition regarding the value of `num` and `cur + 1` and the subsequent actions (setting `cur` to 0 and breaking out of a loop) are not executed in this snippet and do not affect the output state.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is `num`.**
