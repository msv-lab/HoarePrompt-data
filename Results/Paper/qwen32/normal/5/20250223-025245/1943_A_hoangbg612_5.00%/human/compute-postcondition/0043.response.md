The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is greater than 0, and `M[i]` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `cur` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `cur` is greater than 0 and `M[i]` is greater than `i`, we can assume that `i` has just finished an iteration where `M[i] > i`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `cur` should remain unchanged as it is still greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`cur` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
