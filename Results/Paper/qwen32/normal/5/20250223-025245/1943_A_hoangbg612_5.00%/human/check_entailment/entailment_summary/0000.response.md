Let's analyze the given program and its execution summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- Both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It sorts the array `a`.
4. It initializes `cur` to -1 and an empty dictionary `M`.
5. It iterates through the sorted array `a`:
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and records its occurrence in `M`.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
6. After the loop, if all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in `M` with counts less than or equal to their respective values, it increments `cur`.
7. It then iterates from 0 to `cur` to find the smallest index `i` such that the count of numbers less than or equal to `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`.
8. Finally, it prints `cur`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program aims to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently finding the smallest missing non-negative integer.
- **Dictionary `M`**: The dictionary `M` keeps track of the counts of each number in the array.
- **Loop through `a`**: The loop correctly identifies the smallest missing non-negative integer by checking the counts of numbers.
- **Final Adjustment**: The final loop adjusts `cur` to ensure it reflects the correct MEX.

However, the logic in the program does not fully account for optimal play by Alice and Bob. Specifically:

- The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
- It assumes that the optimal play can be determined solely by counting occurrences and sorting, which is not necessarily true when considering the strategic choices of both players.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob. It does not consider the strategic choices made by each player during the game, which could affect the final MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
