Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly implements the described game mechanics and optimally computes the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program starts by sorting the array `N`. This step is crucial because it helps in determining the smallest missing non-negative integer efficiently.
   
2. **Tracking the Current MEX (`cur`):**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` and is used to track the current MEX of the array `c`. It is incremented as the smallest missing non-negative integer is identified.
   
3. **Dictionary `M` for Counting:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the sorted array `N`.
   
4. **Iterating Through Sorted Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`. For each number `num`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks out of the loop because `cur + 1` would be the smallest missing non-negative integer.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   
5. **Adjusting `cur` if All Numbers are Present:**
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the size of the array `N`), it means all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present in `N`. Therefore, it increments `cur` by `1` to find the next smallest missing non-negative integer.
   
6. **Final Adjustment for `cur`:**
   - The program then iterates through the range `[0, cur)` to find the smallest `i` such that `M[i] <= i`. This step ensures that `cur` is set to the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c` after the optimal play by Alice and Bob.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Sorting:** Sorting the array helps in efficiently finding the smallest missing non-negative integer.
- **Tracking MEX (`cur`):** The logic for updating `cur` based on the counts in `M` is correct. It ensures that `cur` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` after the optimal play.
- **Handling Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present in `N` by incrementing `cur` by `1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It efficiently determines the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` by leveraging sorting and counting.

**Correctness: True**
