The `break` statement will terminate the loop in which it is contained, but it will not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, and `M[i]` remain unchanged. The loop simply exits without modifying any of these variables.

Output State: **`cur` is `i`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts, and the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**
