Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1` (which is 0), `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
