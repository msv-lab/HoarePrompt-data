Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `cur` is `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is `i + 2`, and `cur` is set to the value of `i`, which is `i + 2`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `i` and `cur`.
