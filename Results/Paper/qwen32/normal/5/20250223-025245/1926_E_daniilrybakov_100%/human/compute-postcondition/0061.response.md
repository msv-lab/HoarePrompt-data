The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `n` is the first input integer. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero value.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `_` is 1**
