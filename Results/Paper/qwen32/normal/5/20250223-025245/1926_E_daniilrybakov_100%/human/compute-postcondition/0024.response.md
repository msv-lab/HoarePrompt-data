Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is now `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `2*((n // 2) + 1) // 2`; `m` is 4; `x` is `((n // 2) + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged due to the `break` statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.**
