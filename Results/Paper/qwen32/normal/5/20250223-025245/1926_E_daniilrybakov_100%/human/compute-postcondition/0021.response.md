The code snippet provided is `x = (n + 1) // 2`. This line recalculates the value of `x` based on the current value of `n`. Given the initial state, `x` is initially defined as `(n + 1) // 2`. Since the code snippet reassigns `x` with the same expression, the value of `x` does not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables `x`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `2*x`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`; If `x < k` and `k <= 2*x`, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain as described. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
