The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is 0 and `k` is an input integer, so after reading the input, `n` will be updated to the first integer provided, and `k` will be updated to the second integer provided. The values of `t`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `s` is the accumulated sum of `(n + 1) // 2` values from each iteration; `m` is `2^i`, where `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed**.
