The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch (in the case of some other languages, but Python does not have switch-case). Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is now `(n // 2)`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
