The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` is 0 and `k` is an input integer. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will be updated to the values provided in the input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `m`, and `_`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first input integer; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is the sum of all (n_i + 1) // 2 values where n_i is the value of n at each iteration; `m` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations the loop executed; `_` is 1.**
