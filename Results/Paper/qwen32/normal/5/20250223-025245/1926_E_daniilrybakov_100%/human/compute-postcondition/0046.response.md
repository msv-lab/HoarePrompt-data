Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is now `(n // 2)`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.**

In simple terms, the value of `s` has been updated to `x + (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
