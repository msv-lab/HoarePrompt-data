### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given problem, the provided code, and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` possible outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. For the i-th outcome, if it wins, the amount received is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.

The key requirement is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \text{ for all } i \]

This can be rearranged to:
\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]

#### Approach

The provided code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `k_i` and then attempts to derive bets `x_i` based on this LCM. Here's how the code works:

1. **Calculate LCM of all `k_i`**:
   - `m = func_2(k)` computes the LCM of all `k_i`.
   
2. **Determine bets `x_i`**:
   - For each `i`, `c[i] = m // k[i]`.
   - This means `x_i` is set to the LCM divided by `k_i`.

3. **Check if the total bet is valid**:
   - If `sum(c) >= m`, print `-1` (no valid distribution).
   - Otherwise, print the bets `c`.

#### Annotations Analysis

- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - Computes the LCM of `a` and `b`.
  - `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)` correctly computes the LCM.

- **Function `func_2(numbers)`**:
  - Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.
  - The final `result` is the LCM of all numbers in the list.

- **Main Logic**:
  - `m = func_2(k)` computes the LCM of all multipliers.
  - `c.append(m // k[i])` sets each bet `x_i` to `m // k_i`.
  - The check `if sum(c) >= m` ensures that the total bet is less than the LCM.

#### Verification

The approach taken by the code is correct. Hereâ€™s why:

- **LCM Calculation**:
  - The LCM of all `k_i` ensures that `m` is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
  
- **Bet Calculation**:
  - Setting `x_i = m // k_i` ensures that the sum of all bets is less than `m`.
  - For any winning outcome `i`, the amount received is `k_i * x_i = k_i * (m // k_i) = m`, which is greater than the total bet `sum(c)`.

- **Validation**:
  - The check `if sum(c) >= m` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM, satisfying the problem's requirement.

#### Conclusion

The provided code correctly calculates the bets `x_i` based on the LCM of all multipliers and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
