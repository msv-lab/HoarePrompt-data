The code snippet provided updates the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1` with the current `result` and `num` as arguments. The value of `num` is the second element in the remaining part of the list `numbers`. After the function call, `result` is reassigned to the return value of `func_1`.

Since the initial state specifies that `result` is already the return value of `func_1(result, num)` before the code snippet, and the code snippet calls `func_1` again with the same arguments, we can infer that `result` will be updated to the return value of this new call.

The initial state does not specify the exact values of `numbers` or the behavior of `func_1`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result` after the function call. However, we can describe the state in terms of the function call.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least three elements; `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`, where `num` is the second element in the remaining part of the list.**
