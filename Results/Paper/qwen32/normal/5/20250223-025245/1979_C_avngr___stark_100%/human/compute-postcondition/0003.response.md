The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since the loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `numbers` after the first one.

At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `numbers` after the current `num`.

Since the loop is iterating over `numbers[1:]`, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`. Therefore, `num` should be the second element in the remaining part of the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least three elements; `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`, `num` is the second element in the remaining part of the list**
