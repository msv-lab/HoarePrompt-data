Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` possible outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. For the i-th outcome, if it wins, the amount received is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.

### Requirements

1. The total amount of coins bet should be less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome.
2. Each bet `x_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9).

### Approach

To ensure that the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome, we need to find a set of bets `x_i` such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \text{ for all } i \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]

To find such a set of `x_i`, we can use the concept of least common multiple (LCM). One way to ensure the condition is met is to set each `x_i` to be a multiple of the LCM of the multipliers `k_j` for `j ≠ i`. This ensures that the sum of bets on other outcomes is significantly smaller compared to the bet on the i-th outcome scaled by `k_i`.

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code includes two functions:

1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. `func_2(numbers)`: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers.

However, the code does not fully implement the solution to the problem. It calculates the LCM of all multipliers, but it does not use this LCM to derive the bets `x_i`.

### Correct Solution Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we can:

1. Compute the LCM of all multipliers.
2. For each outcome `i`, set the bet `x_i` to be the LCM of all other multipliers divided by `k_i - 1`. This ensures that the sum of bets on other outcomes is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not fully implement the solution to the problem. It only calculates the LCM of all multipliers but does not derive the bets `x_i` based on the LCM. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
