Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least three elements; `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)` where `num` is the third element in the list `numbers`.**

Explanation: The value of `result` is updated to the return value of the function `func_1` when called with the current `result` and `num` (which is the third element in the list `numbers`). The list `numbers` remains unchanged, and `num` continues to be the third element in the list `numbers`.
