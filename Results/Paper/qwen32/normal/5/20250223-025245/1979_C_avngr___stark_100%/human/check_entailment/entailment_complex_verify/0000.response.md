### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The problem requires distributing bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i
\]
This can be simplified by setting \(x_i = \frac{\text{LCM}(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n)}{k_i}\).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b` using the formula: \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).
   - This function is correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Computes the LCM of a list of integers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.
   - This function is also correctly implemented.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
   - Computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - Sets each bet \(x_i\) to \(\frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\).
   - Checks if the total bet \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is less than the LCM. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\).

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the purpose and behavior of `func_1` and `func_2`.
- The annotations also correctly describe the main logic of the program.

#### Evaluation:
- The logic of setting \(x_i = \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\) ensures that for each outcome \(i\):
  \[
  k_i \cdot x_i = k_i \cdot \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} = \text{LCM}
  \]
- The total bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\).
- The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \text{LCM}\) must hold for a valid solution.

Given that the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all \(k_i\), the total bet \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\) will indeed be less than the LCM unless all \(k_i\) are equal (which would make the sum equal to the LCM).

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets. The original assessment incorrectly states that the code does not solve the problem. The code indeed calculates the LCM and uses it to determine the bets, ensuring that the total bet is less than the returns for each outcome.

### Final: **True**
