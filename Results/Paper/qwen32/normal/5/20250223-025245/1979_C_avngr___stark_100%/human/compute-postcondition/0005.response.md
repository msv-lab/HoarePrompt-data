The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `numbers` starting from the second element (`numbers[1:]`). At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element in the remaining part of the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in the list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `numbers` is a list of integers with at least three elements.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`, where `num` is the second element in the remaining part of the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element in the remaining part of the list. So, for the next iteration, `num` should be the third element in the list `numbers`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least three elements; `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`, where `num` is the second element in the remaining part of the list; `num` is the third element in the list `numbers`.**
