You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.

    #State: The loop has executed `a` times, where `a` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the coordinates of the corners of a square are read, and the side length of the square is calculated as the absolute difference in the y-coordinates if two pairs of x-coordinates are equal, or in the x-coordinates if two pairs of y-coordinates are equal. The area of the square, which is the side length squared, is then printed. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res` are updated with the values from each test case during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates and prints the area of the square.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all possible configurations of the square's corners correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that the corners are aligned in a way that makes it easy to determine the side length by comparing x-coordinates directly. However, the corners can be given in any random order, and the program does not account for all possible permutations of the corners.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
2 1
1 3
3 1
```
In this case, the square has a side length of 2, and the area should be 4. However, the program will not correctly identify the side length because it relies on specific x-coordinate comparisons that do not hold in this configuration.

A correct approach would involve determining the side length by calculating the distances between all pairs of points and identifying the two unique distances (side length and diagonal length). The side length can then be used to calculate the area.
