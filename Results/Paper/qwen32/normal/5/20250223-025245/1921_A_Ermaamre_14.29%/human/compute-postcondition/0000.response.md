Output State: **`a` is an input integer, the input consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, with each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

In natural language: The variable `a` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The rest of the input conditions remain unchanged.
