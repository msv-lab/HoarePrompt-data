Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1` and `y1` are the input integers, `x2` and `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3` and `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4` and `y4` are the newly input integers, and `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`**
