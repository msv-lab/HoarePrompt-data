Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y3` are the input integers, `x4` and `y4` are the newly input integers. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
