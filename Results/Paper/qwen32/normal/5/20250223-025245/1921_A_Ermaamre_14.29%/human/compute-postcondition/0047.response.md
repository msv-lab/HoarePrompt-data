To determine the output of the `print(res ** 2)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions under which `res` is defined.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i + 1` (but `i` is not used in the given snippet, so it's irrelevant for this task).
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers.
- `res` is defined based on specific conditions involving these input integers.

### Conditions for `res`:
1. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`.
2. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
3. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
4. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.

### Analysis:
Since `res` is squared in the `print` statement, we need to consider the value of `res` in the conditions where it is defined. The `res` value is always the absolute difference between two `y` values, which means `res` is a non-negative integer. Squaring a non-negative integer will still yield a non-negative integer.

### Output:
The `print(res ** 2)` statement will print the square of `res`, where `res` is defined based on the given conditions. If `res` is not defined, the code would result in an error, but since we are given that `res` is defined under certain conditions, we will assume one of those conditions holds true.

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is the absolute difference between two y-values based on the given conditions)**

If we were to be more specific, it would be:
- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y3 - y1)`, and the output is `abs(y3 - y1) ** 2`.
- If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, and the output is `abs(y2 - y1) ** 2`.
- If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`, and the output is `abs(y1 - y2) ** 2`.

However, since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of the conditions.

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is the absolute difference between two y-values based on the given conditions)**
