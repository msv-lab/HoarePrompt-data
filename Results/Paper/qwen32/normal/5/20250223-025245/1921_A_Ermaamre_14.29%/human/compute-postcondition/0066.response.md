Output State: **The loop has executed `a` times, where `a` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the coordinates of the corners of a square are read, and the side length of the square is calculated as the absolute difference in the y-coordinates if two pairs of x-coordinates are equal, or in the x-coordinates if two pairs of y-coordinates are equal. The area of the square, which is the side length squared, is then printed. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res` are updated with the values from each test case during each iteration.**

In simpler terms: The loop processes `a` test cases, where for each test case, it reads the coordinates of a square and calculates its area by determining the side length from the coordinates. The area is then printed. The loop iterates exactly `a` times, and the variables used in the loop are updated with the values from each test case during each iteration.
