The code calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns this value to `res`. Given that `y1` is less than `y2`, the absolute difference is simply `y2 - y1`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` remain unchanged, and the relationship between `x1` and `x2`, and `x3` and `x4` continues to hold. The relationship between `y1` and `y2` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `x2` is the second integer from the input, `x3` is the third integer from the input, `x4` is the fourth integer from the input, `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, `y1` is the fifth integer from the input, `y2` is the sixth integer from the input, `y3` is the seventh integer from the input, `y4` is the eighth integer from the input, and `res` is `y2 - y1`.**
