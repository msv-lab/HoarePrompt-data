Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`; otherwise, `res` is set to `y1 - y2`.**
