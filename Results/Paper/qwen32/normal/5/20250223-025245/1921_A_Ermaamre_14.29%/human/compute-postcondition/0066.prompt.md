Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an input integer, the input consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, with each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values. If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. Otherwise, if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Additionally, if `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`; otherwise, `res` is `y1 - y2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are the input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are the input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y3 - y1)`. Otherwise, if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`. If `x1 != x2` or `x3 != x4`, and `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`. In all other cases, `res` is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
