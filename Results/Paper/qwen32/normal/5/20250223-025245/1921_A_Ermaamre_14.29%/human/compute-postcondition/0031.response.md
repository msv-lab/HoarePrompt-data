The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x1` and `y1`. The initial state specifies that `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values. After the execution of the code, `x1` and `y1` will hold the new input values, while all other variables will retain their original values.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1` and `y1` are the input integers, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values.**
