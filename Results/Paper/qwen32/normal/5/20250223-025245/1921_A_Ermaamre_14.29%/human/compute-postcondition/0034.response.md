The code snippet assigns new values to `x4` and `y4` by reading input from the user and splitting it into two integers. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1` and `y1` are the input integers, `x2` and `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3` and `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4` and `y4` are the newly input integers.**
