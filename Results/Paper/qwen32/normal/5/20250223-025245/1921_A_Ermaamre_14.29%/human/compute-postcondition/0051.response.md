The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `res` remain unchanged. The new values for `x3` and `y3` are the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1` are the input integers, `x2`, `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3`, `y3` are the newly input integers, `res` is not defined.**
