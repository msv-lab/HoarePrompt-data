To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variable `curr` is updated based on the elements of the list `nums`. The loop iterates over each element in `nums`, and if the element is not zero, it updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current element and the last element seen in the previous iteration.

Let's break down the final state of `curr`:

1. **Initialization**: `curr` starts at 0.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `i` in `nums`:
     - If `i != 0`, `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to it.
     - `last` is updated to be the current `i`.

After the loop completes, `curr` will have accumulated the sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero elements in `nums`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the number of integers in `nums`.
- `nums` remains unchanged as it is the list of integers read from the input.
- `last` will be the last element of `nums` after the loop completes.
- `curr` will be the accumulated sum of differences `i - last` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`.

### Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the number of integers in `nums`, `nums` is the list of integers read from the input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the accumulated sum of differences `i - last` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`.**

In simpler terms, `curr` will hold the sum of differences between consecutive non-zero elements in the list `nums` after the loop finishes executing.
