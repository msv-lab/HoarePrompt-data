To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how it affects the variables.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the following steps are performed:
1. `n` (the number of integers) and `nums` (the list of integers) are read.
2. `last` is set to the last element of `nums`.
3. `curr` is initialized to 0.
4. For each `i` in `nums`, if `i` is not 0, `curr` is incremented by `i - last`.
5. If `curr` is 0, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.

The key variable `curr` accumulates the sum of differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0, it implies that the sum of the differences is zero, which is only possible if the list `nums` has a specific structure (details below).

After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` will reflect the state of the last iteration. However, the overall output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" prints for each test case.

Let's summarize the output state after all iterations:
- The variable `t` will reflect the number of test cases that have been processed.
- `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` will reflect the values from the last test case.
- The output will be a series of "YES" or "NO" based on whether `curr` was 0 for each test case.

Output State: **After all iterations, `t` test cases have been processed. For each test case, "YES" is printed if the sum of differences `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums` equals 0; otherwise, "NO" is printed. The variables `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` will reflect the state of the last test case.**

In simpler terms, the output state is a series of "YES" or "NO" for each test case, and the variables will reflect the state of the last test case processed.
