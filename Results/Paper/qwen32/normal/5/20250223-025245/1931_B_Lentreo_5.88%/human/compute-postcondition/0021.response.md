Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the number of integers in `nums`, `nums` is the list of integers read from the input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the accumulated sum of differences `i - last` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
