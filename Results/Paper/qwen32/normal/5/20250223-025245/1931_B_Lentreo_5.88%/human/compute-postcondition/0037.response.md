To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variable `curr` based on the elements in the list `nums`.

Here's the loop in question:
```python
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `nums` is the list of integers read from the input.
  - `last` is the last element of `nums` before the loop starts.
  - `curr` is initialized to 0.

- **Loop Execution**:
  - For each element `i` in `nums`, if `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.
  - `last` is updated to the current element `i` after each iteration.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `nums` remains unchanged.
- `last` will be the last element of `nums` after the loop completes.
- `curr` will be the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the input list of integers, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list.**
