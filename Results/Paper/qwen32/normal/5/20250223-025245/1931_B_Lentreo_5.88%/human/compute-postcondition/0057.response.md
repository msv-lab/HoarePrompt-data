Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is `nums[-1]`, `i` is the next element in `nums` after `last`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.**
