The value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last`. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `last` is the last element of `nums` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums` after `last`, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.**
