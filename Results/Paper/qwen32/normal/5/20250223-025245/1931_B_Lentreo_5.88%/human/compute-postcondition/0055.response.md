The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is the current element being iterated over from the list `nums`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `nums` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `next_element`, which is the current element of `nums` being processed. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list `nums`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `nums` as `current_index`. At the end of the last iteration, `current_index` would be the index of `next_element`. For the next iteration, `current_index` should be incremented by 1, and `i` should be assigned the value at the new `current_index` in `nums`.

Since `last` is `nums[-1]` and `curr` is updated based on the value of `i` and `last`, these variables are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here. The state of `t` and `n` also does not change in relation to the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in the list `nums`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is `nums[-1]`, `i` is the next element in `nums` after `next_element`**
