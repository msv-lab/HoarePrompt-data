### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, but only from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index. The key observation is that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water in each container is `sum(a_i) / n`.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate the Target Amount:** Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is `sum(a_i) / n`.
2. **Track Cumulative Sum:** Track the cumulative sum of water as we iterate through the containers.
3. **Check Consistency:** At each step, check if the cumulative sum is consistent with the target amount of water for the containers seen so far. Specifically, the cumulative sum up to the `i-th` container should be `i * (sum(a_i) / n)`.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
Let's review the code provided:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `last`:** The variable `last` is set to the last element of the list (`nums[-1]`), which is not used correctly in the logic.
2. **Incorrect Cumulative Sum Logic:** The logic `curr += i - last` is incorrect. It doesn't properly check if the cumulative sum can be evenly distributed up to the current container.
3. **No Target Calculation:** The program doesn't calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
4. **Incorrect Condition for "YES":** The condition `if curr == 0` does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Initialization:** `last` is set to the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is initialized to 0.
- **Loop:** For each element `i` in `nums`, if `i` is not zero, `curr` is updated by `i - last`. This logic does not ensure that the cumulative sum is consistent with the target amount.
- **Final Check:** The condition `if curr == 0` is checked to determine if the water can be evenly distributed, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have.
2. Track the cumulative sum and check if it matches the expected cumulative sum for each container.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        curr = 0
        for i in range(n):
            curr += nums[i]
            if curr != (i + 1) * target:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers based on the given constraints and operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
