Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The program incorrectly calculates the `curr` variable by iterating through the list and subtracting the last element from each non-zero element. This approach does not accurately reflect the logic needed to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
- The sum of the water in the containers is 6, which is divisible by 3 (the number of containers).
- However, it is not possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers using the given operation (pouring water from an earlier container to a later one).

The program will output `YES` for this input, which is incorrect.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the process of redistributing water. It incorrectly calculates the difference between each element and the last element, which does not reflect the actual redistribution process required by the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if, for each prefix of the array, the sum of the elements in that prefix is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the entire array divided by the number of containers (the target amount each container should have). This ensures that you can redistribute the water from earlier containers to later ones without exceeding the target amount at any point.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total // n
        curr_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            curr_sum += nums[i]
            if curr_sum > target * (i + 1):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected program correctly checks if the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring that at no point does the sum of the water in the first `i+1` containers exceed the target amount multiplied by `i+1`.
