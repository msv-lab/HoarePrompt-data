The code `curr += i - last` updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between the current element `i` and the previous element `last` in the list `nums`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input
- `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration
- `i` is the next element in `nums`

After executing `curr += i - last`:
- The value of `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`

The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums`, and `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**.
