Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to construct an array of integers such that the number of strictly increasing subsequences in the array is exactly X. If no such array can be constructed, the program should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`.

2. **Array Construction Logic:**
   - The program initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `X` by 2 (if `X` is even) or decrement `X` by 1 (if `X` is odd).
   - Depending on whether `X` is even or odd, it appends either `max` or `min` to the `ans` list and adjusts `max` or `min` accordingly.
   - The process continues until `X` becomes 1.
   - The constructed array `ans` is then reversed and printed.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the constructed array is printed.
   - The elements of the constructed array are printed.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Number of Increasing Subsequences:**
  - The program attempts to construct an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
  - The logic used in the program is based on the idea that appending either a large or small number can create new increasing subsequences, but it does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly `X`.
  - The approach of repeatedly dividing `X` by 2 and decrementing it by 1 does not inherently ensure that the number of increasing subsequences in the constructed array will match `X`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle the case where `X` is very large (close to \(10^{18}\)). The constructed array might exceed the length constraint of 200.
  - The program does not handle cases where constructing an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences is impossible.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
