Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999998, 99999999, or 100000000, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either [100000000, max], [-100000000, max], [100000000, min], or [-100000000, min], and `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is even, `max` is reduced by 1 and `ans` includes `max`. If `x` is odd, `min` is increased by 1 and `ans` includes `min`.**
