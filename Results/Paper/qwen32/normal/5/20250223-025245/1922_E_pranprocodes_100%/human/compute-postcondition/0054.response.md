Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either [100000000] or [-100000000], and `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is even, `max` becomes 99999999 and `ans` becomes [100000000]. Otherwise, `min` becomes -99999999 and `ans` becomes [-100000000].**
