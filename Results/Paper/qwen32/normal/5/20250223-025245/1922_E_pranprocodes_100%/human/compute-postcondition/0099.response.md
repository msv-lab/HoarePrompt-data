The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is odd or even. The value of `ans` changes from `[100000000]` or `[-100000000]` to `[100000000, -99999999]` or `[-100000000, -100000000]` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is `[100000000, -99999999]` if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is `[-100000000, -100000000]`, and `i` is `i` + 1**.
