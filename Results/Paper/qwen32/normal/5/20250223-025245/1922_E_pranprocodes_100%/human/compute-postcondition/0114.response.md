The code snippet provided is `ans.reverse()`, which reverses the order of the elements in the list `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the list `ans` contains the `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration. After executing `ans.reverse()`, the order of these elements in `ans` will be reversed.

Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values `x` took, `ans` is the list of `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration but in reverse order, and `i` is `i` + 1.**
