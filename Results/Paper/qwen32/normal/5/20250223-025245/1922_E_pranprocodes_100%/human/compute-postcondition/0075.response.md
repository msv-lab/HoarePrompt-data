Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations needed to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is 1, `max` is the initial max value minus the number of even `x` values encountered, `min` is the initial min value plus the number of odd `x` values encountered, `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration, and `i` is `i` + 1.**

Explanation: The list `ans` has been reversed, meaning the order of its elements is flipped. All other variables remain unchanged.
