The code divides `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` is even, the result of `x // 2` will still be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` must not be 1 and `x` is even // 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], and `i` is `i` + 1**
In natural language: `t` remains 0, `x` is now half of its previous even value (and is still even), `max` remains 99999999, `min` remains -100000000, `ans` remains [100000000], and `i` is incremented by 1.
