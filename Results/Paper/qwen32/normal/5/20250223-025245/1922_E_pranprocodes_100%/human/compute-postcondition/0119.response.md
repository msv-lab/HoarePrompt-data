Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each with an integer `X` (where 2 <= X <= 10^18). For each test case, it performs a series of operations to reduce `X` to 1, appending either a decreasing maximum value or an increasing minimum value to a list based on whether `X` is even or odd, respectively. It then prints the number of operations performed and the list of appended values in reverse order.**
