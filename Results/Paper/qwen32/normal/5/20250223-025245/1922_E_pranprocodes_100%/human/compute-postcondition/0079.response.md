The value of `x` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of iterations needed to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is the input integer, `max` is the initial max value minus the number of even `x` values encountered, `min` is the initial min value plus the number of odd `x` values encountered, `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration, and `i` is `i` + 1.
