The code `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. Given the initial state, `x` is an input integer and not equal to 1. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation.

If `x` was initially even, after decrementing by 1, `x` becomes odd. If `x` was initially odd, after decrementing by 1, `x` becomes even. However, the values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` are set based on the initial value of `x` (before the decrement), and these values do not change after the decrement operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` is not equal to 1; if `x` was initially even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [100000000, -100000000]; if `x` was initially odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999]**.
