Output State: **`t` is 2; `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity and is not equal to 1, and is now `x // 2`; if the original `x` was even, `x` is now `(x / 2) // 2`; if the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `((x - 1) // 2)`; `max` is 99999997`, `min` is -99999999`, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 99999998] if the original `x` was even, or `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, 100000000] if the original `x` was odd.**

Natural Language: The value of `x` has been further modified by integer division by 2. If the original `x` was even, `x` is now `(x / 2) // 2`. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `((x - 1) // 2)`. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
