To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to understand the behavior of the variables and the list `ans` as described in the initial state.

### Understanding the Initial State:
1. **`t`**: The total number of iterations.
2. **`x`**: Initially set to 1.
3. **`max` and `min`**: These variables are adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values `x` took during the iterations.
4. **`ans`**: A list that stores the `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration but in reverse order.
5. **`i`**: The iteration counter, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Iteration Process:
Since the exact sequence of `x` (whether it is even or odd) is not specified, we can only describe the general behavior of the `ans` list.

- During each iteration, `x` is checked to see if it is even or odd.
- Based on the value of `x`, `max` and `min` are updated.
- After each iteration, the current values of `max` and `min` are appended to the `ans` list.
- After all iterations, the `ans` list is reversed before being printed.

### Output Description:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the contents of the `ans` list, which contains pairs of `max` and `min` values from each iteration, in reverse order.

Since the exact values of `max` and `min` at each iteration are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the general structure of the `ans` list.

### Example Scenario:
Let's consider a hypothetical scenario where `t` is 3, and the sequence of `x` values during the iterations is as follows:
- Iteration 1: `x` is 1 (odd), so `max` and `min` are adjusted accordingly.
- Iteration 2: `x` is 2 (even), so `max` and `min` are adjusted accordingly.
- Iteration 3: `x` is 3 (odd), so `max` and `min` are adjusted accordingly.

Suppose the values of `max` and `min` after each iteration are as follows:
- After Iteration 1: `max = 1`, `min = 1`
- After Iteration 2: `max = 2`, `min = 1`
- After Iteration 3: `max = 3`, `min = 1`

The `ans` list would be `[(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]` before reversing. After reversing, the `ans` list becomes `[(3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)]`.

### General Output:
Given the general structure of the `ans` list and its reversal, the output will be the reversed list of `max` and `min` pairs.

Output: **[(max_t, min_t), ..., (max_2, min_2), (max_1, min_1)] (where (max_i, min_i) are the max and min values after the i-th iteration, and the list is in reverse order)**
