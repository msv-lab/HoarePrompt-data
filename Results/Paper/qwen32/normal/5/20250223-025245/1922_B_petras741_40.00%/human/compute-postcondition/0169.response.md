Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of sticks and a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the exponent of 2 for the length of the corresponding stick. The function then determines whether it is possible to form a square using all the sticks and returns "YES" if possible, otherwise "NO".**
