Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list where each index `j` (from 0 to `n`) has a value equal to the number of times `j` appears in the list `w` and `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` is equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[0]]` to `q[eta[eta_ln - 1]]`, and `res` is updated by the cumulative additions from each iteration of the loop. If `n` is less than 3, no additional variables are defined or modified beyond the initial state.**
