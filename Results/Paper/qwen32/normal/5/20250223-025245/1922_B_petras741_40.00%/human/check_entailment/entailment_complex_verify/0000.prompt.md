You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three sticks from the given set of sticks.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the code does not properly check the triangle inequality conditions, which are necessary for forming a valid triangle. The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The code does not check the triangle inequality conditions. It only counts combinations of sticks without verifying if they can form a triangle.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop `if j > 1000: break` is arbitrary and does not serve any logical purpose in the context of the problem. This loop can cause the program to terminate prematurely without processing all test cases correctly.

3. **Handling of Single Length Case**: The code correctly handles the case where all sticks have the same length, but it does not correctly handle other cases where different lengths are involved.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:**
- The possible combinations of sticks are (1, 2, 2), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), and (2, 2, 3).
- Only (1, 2, 2) and (2, 2, 3) satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.

**Actual Output of the Provided Program:**
```
0
```

The program incorrectly outputs `0` because it does not properly check the triangle inequality conditions.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
