The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop will execute based on the range specified, which is `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is set to the starting value of the range, which is `0`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `j` is already set to `n-1`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `j` to `0`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]` which is incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` which is incremented by 1, `q[w[2]]` which is incremented by 1, and so on until `q[w[n-1]]` which is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**
