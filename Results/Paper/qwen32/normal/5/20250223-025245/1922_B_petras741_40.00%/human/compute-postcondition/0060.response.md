The code reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `w`. The variables `t`, `i`, `buffer`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input.**
