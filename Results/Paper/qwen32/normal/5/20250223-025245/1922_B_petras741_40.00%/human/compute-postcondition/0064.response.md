The given code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given the initial state, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, and `w` is a list of integers. 

Since `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, the value at the index `w[j]` in `q` will now be 1 (since it was initially 0).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 1.**
