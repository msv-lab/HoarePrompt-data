Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `0` to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` is `n` and `rho` is 1. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `j` is `eta_ln`, and `rho` is `1 + sum(q[eta[j]] for j in range(1, eta_ln))`. If `n` is less than 3, none of the additional variables `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `j`, or `rho` are defined or modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list where each index `j` (from 0 to `n`) has a value equal to the number of times `j` appears in the list `w` and `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` is equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[0]]` to `q[eta[eta_ln - 1]]`, and `res` is updated by the cumulative additions from each iteration of the loop. If `n` is less than 3, no additional variables are defined or modified beyond the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, then `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique integers from the list `w`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of all counts in `q` corresponding to the unique integers in `eta`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, or `rho`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
