The given code snippet is:

```python
res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
```

This line of code modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to it.

Let's break down the impact on the variables:

- `res` is updated by adding the computed value from the expression.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`) remain unchanged.

The output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `0` to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is 1, `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`.**

In simple terms, the value of `res` is increased by the computed value from the expression, while all other variables retain their initial values.
