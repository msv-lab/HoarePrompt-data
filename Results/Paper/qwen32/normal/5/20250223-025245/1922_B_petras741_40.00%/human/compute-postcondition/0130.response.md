The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted as it is the upper limit for the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list, `j` is 3**
