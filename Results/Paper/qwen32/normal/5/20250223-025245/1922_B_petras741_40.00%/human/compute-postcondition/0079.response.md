The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is 3, `eta` will now contain the value 3 in addition to any values it previously held. If `q[2]` was greater than 0, `eta` initially contained the value 2. After the append operation, `eta` will contain the values [2, 3]. If `q[2]` was not greater than 0, `eta` was initially empty and will now contain [3].

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 2, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing the values [2, 3] if `q[2]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing the value [3].**
