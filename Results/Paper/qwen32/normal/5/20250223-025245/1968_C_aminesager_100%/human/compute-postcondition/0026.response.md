The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t`, and `n` remains the same input integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[i-1]]` up to the length of `T`, `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces, `line` is the input string.**
