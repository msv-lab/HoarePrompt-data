Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`; `a` remains a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]]`; `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces; `line` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `T` to be a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`. All other variables remain unchanged.
