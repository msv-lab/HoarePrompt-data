Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`; `a` is a list containing the single element `[1000]`; `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces; `line` is the input string.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is reset to `[1000]` by the code snippet, and all other variables remain unchanged.
