The only variable in the loop head of the given `for` loop is `_` and `t`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable that can be adjusted to determine if the loop can execute again is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99. Since the loop iterates `t` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. After each iteration, `t` is implicitly decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 99; `a` is a new 2D list containing 4 lists of integers from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the new `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.**
