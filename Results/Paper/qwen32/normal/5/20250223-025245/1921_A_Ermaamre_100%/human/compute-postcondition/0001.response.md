In the given task, the for loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a conventional placeholder for a variable that we do not plan to use in the loop body, and `t` determines the number of iterations.

To ensure the loop executes, the only state we need to adjust is `t`. Since `t` is already given as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop body.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
