The code snippet reads 4 lines of input, each line containing space-separated integers, and assigns these integers to a 2D list `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, but this variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers, where each inner list corresponds to the integers from one line of input.**
