test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples. Each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case guarantees that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0) area, with corners in the given points.
