The provided Python code snippet creates a new list `x` that contains the first element from each of the inner lists in the 2D list `a`. Given that `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists, `x` will be a list of 4 integers, each being the first element of the corresponding inner list in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers, where each inner list corresponds to the integers from one line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in `a`.**
