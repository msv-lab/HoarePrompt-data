The code snippet provided is:

```python
t = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. After executing this line, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided by the user, which still satisfies the condition 1 <= t <= 100. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases.**
