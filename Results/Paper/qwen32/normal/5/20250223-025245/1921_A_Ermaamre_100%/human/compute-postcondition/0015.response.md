To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 99.
2. `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers.
3. `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the initial `a`.
4. `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(dx * dx)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: It is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers. For example, it could be `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]`.
2. **List `x`**: It is constructed by taking the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in `a`. Using the example above, `x` would be `[1, 4, 7, 10]`.
3. **Value of `dx`**: This is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. Continuing with the example, the maximum value in `x` is 10 and the minimum value is 1, so `dx` would be `10 - 1 = 9`.
4. **Expression `dx * dx`**: This expression computes the square of `dx`. Using the example, `dx * dx` would be `9 * 9 = 81`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the square of `dx`, which is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**

If we were to provide a more specific numerical example based on the provided structure, it would look like:
Output: **81 (where dx is 9, the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**

However, since the exact values of the lists in `a` are not provided, the most precise description possible is:
Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
