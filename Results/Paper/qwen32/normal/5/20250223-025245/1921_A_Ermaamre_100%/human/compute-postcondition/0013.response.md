The code snippet provided is:
```
x = [p[0] for p in a]
```
This line of code reassigns the list `x` to contain the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the 2D list `a`.

Given that `x` was initially defined as the list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the initial `a`, reassigning `x` with the same operation does not change the values of `x`. Therefore, the value of `x` remains the same as it was initially.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet, so the values of `t`, `a`, and `dx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 99; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers from the new input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the initial `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.**
