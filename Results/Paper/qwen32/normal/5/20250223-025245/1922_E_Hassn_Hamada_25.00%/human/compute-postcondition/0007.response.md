To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `size` is increased by 1. This means that the loop condition was true for the previous value of `size`, but we need to ensure it remains true for the current value of `size`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop condition**: The variables in the loop condition are `size` and `number`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` must be true for the loop to execute. Here, `1 << size + 1` is equivalent to `2^(size + 1)`, so the condition can be rewritten as `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `size` has already been increased by 1, we need to ensure that the condition `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number` is still true for the current value of `size`.

Given that `size` has been increased by 1, the previous iteration must have satisfied `2^size - 1 <= number`. To ensure the loop executes again, we need `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number` to be true.

Therefore, `number` must be at least `2^(size + 1) - 1`.

State: **`size` is increased by 1 and `number` must be at least `2^(size + 1) - 1`**.
