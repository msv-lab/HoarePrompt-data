You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The task is to generate an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. The program provided seems to be using a recursive function `func_1` to generate the sequence based on the given number `X`.

Here's the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `number == 0` by returning 0.
2. **Sequence Generation**: The function `func_1` generates a sequence by appending indices up to a certain size and recursively calling itself to adjust the sequence based on the remaining number.
3. **Adjustment of Sequence**: The sequence is adjusted by adding the result of the recursive call to specific elements in the sequence.
4. **Output**: The main part of the code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and then printing the length and the sequence.

However, the correctness of the code depends on whether it correctly generates a sequence with exactly X increasing subsequences for all valid values of X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).

The function `func_1` appears to be based on the idea of generating binary numbers and adjusting the sequence accordingly. This approach ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly calculated.

Let's test the program with some examples:

### Test Case 1:
Input:
```
2
2
5
```
Output:
```
1
0
3
0 1 0
```
This output is correct because:
- For X=2, the sequence `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
- For X=5, the sequence `[0 1 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0 1]`, and `[0 1 0]`.

### Test Case 2:
Input:
```
1
13
```
Output:
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
This output is correct because the sequence `[2 2 3 4 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

### Test Case 3:
Input:
```
1
37
```
Output:
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
This output is correct because the sequence `[-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

Given the provided test cases and the logic in the code, it appears that the program correctly generates sequences with the required number of increasing subsequences. The program handles the edge cases and the constraints specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the test cases, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
