Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and its function summaries to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences for an array can be complex to calculate directly, but the provided program uses a recursive approach to generate such an array.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each with an integer \( X \) (the number of increasing subsequences required). For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate a sequence that meets the criteria. The function `func_1` is recursive and constructs the sequence by appending elements and adjusting them based on the results of the recursive call.

#### Key Points:
1. **Base Case**: If `number == 0`, the function returns 0, indicating no more elements are needed.
2. **Recursive Case**: The function calculates the size of the sequence needed to reach the given number of increasing subsequences. It then recursively builds the sequence by appending elements and adjusting them based on the results of the recursive call.
3. **Output**: The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

### Function Summary
The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input integer `number` and appends the generated sequence to the `sequence` list. It returns the size of the generated sequence. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it constructs the sequence by recursively breaking down the problem and modifying the `sequence` list in place.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify the correctness of the program by analyzing the provided examples:

1. **X = 2**: The output is `1\n0`. The array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
2. **X = 5**: The output is `3\n0 1 0`. The array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, `[1, 0]`.
3. **X = 13**: The output is `5\n2 2 3 4 2`. The array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
4. **X = 37**: The output is `7\n-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`. The array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

The program seems to correctly generate sequences that meet the required number of increasing subsequences for the given examples.

### Detailed Reasoning
The function `func_1` works by leveraging the properties of binary representation to construct the sequence. The key insight is that the number of increasing subsequences can be related to the binary representation of the number of subsequences minus one. The function recursively constructs the sequence by appending elements and adjusting them based on the results of the recursive call.

The function ensures that the constructed sequence has exactly the required number of increasing subsequences by carefully choosing the elements and their positions. The use of binary representation and recursive adjustment ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct in generating an array with the required number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
