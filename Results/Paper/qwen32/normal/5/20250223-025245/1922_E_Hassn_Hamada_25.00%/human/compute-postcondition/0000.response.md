The provided code snippet is a function definition without the actual implementation details. Since the function is supposed to generate a sequence based on the input number and return the size of the generated sequence, I will assume a possible implementation that meets these requirements. A common approach to generate a sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences could be to create a sequence of numbers from 1 to the input number.

Here is a possible implementation of the function:
```python
def generate_sequence(number, sequence):
    sequence.clear()  # Clear any previous data in the sequence
    for i in range(1, number + 1):
        sequence.append(i)
    return len(sequence)
```

Given this implementation, the impact on the program is as follows:
- The `sequence` list is cleared of any previous values.
- A sequence of integers from 1 to `number` is generated and added to the `sequence` list.
- The function returns the length of the generated sequence, which is equal to `number`.

Therefore, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers from 1 to `number`, and the function returns `number`.**
