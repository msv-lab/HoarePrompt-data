Output State: **`size` is increased by 2 and `number` must be at least `2^(size + 1) - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `size` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. The condition that `number` must be at least `2^(size + 1) - 1` still holds, but now it is relative to the new value of `size`.
