To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size`.

Given:
- `number` remains unchanged.
- `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1` with the element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result` twice.
- `size` must be greater than `3`.
- `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
- `i` is `3`.

Since `i` is currently `3`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1` to become `4`. `size` must be greater than `4` for the loop to continue executing.

The other variables (`number`, `sequence`, `size`, `result`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. However, for the sake of completeness, we acknowledge their current states.

State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1` with the element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result` twice, `size` must be greater than `4`, `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `i` is `4`**
