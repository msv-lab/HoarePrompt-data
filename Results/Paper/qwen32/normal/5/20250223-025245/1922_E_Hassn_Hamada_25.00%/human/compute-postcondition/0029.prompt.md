You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers representing the array. However, in the context of the problem description, sequence is not an input but an output to be constructed by the function. The function should generate such a sequence based on the given number of increasing subsequences.
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `number` is an integer such that 2 <= `number` <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers from 1 to `number`, and the function returns `number`. `number` is not equal to 0.
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: - `number` remains unchanged.
    #- `sequence` remains unchanged.
    #- `size` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\).
    #
    #In natural language, the final output state is that `number` and `sequence` remain the same as they were initially, and `size` is the largest integer for which \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1\) is less than or equal to `number`.
    #
    #Output State:
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: `number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1`, and `size` remains unchanged.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: `number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1` with the element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result` exactly `i + 1` times for each `i` from `0` to `size - 1`, `size` remains unchanged, `result` remains the same value as assigned initially.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `number` (an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18) and `sequence` (a list of integers representing the array, which is an output constructed by the function). The function returns 0 in Case_1, and the sum of `size` and `result` in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
