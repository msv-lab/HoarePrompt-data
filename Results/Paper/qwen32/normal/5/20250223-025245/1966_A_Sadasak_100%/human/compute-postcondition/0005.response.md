Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.**
