### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the critical flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` caps the frequency of each number to `k`. This is incorrect because the frequency should reflect the actual count of each number in the list. Capping the frequency to `k` does not provide the correct information needed to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

2. **Determining the Minimum Number of Cards:**
   - The logic used in the program to determine the minimum number of cards is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true. This is not the correct approach. The correct approach involves:
     - Calculating the actual frequency of each card number.
     - For each unique card number, reducing its frequency by multiples of `k-1` (since each operation reduces the count by `1`).
     - Summing up the remaining counts to get the minimum number of cards.

Given these issues, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect. The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
