Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key `num` from `arr` has a value that is the minimum of the count of `num` in `arr` and `k`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing, `frequency_table` will have each unique number from the list `arr` as a key, and its value will be the lesser of how many times that number appears in `arr` or the integer `k`.
