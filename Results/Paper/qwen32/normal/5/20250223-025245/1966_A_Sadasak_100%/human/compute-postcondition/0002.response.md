The code snippet updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `num` key by 1. If `num` does not exist in the dictionary, it initializes the count to 1.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary. After executing the line of code, the `frequency_table` will have an entry for `num` with its count updated. Since `num` is not specified in the initial state, we consider `num` to be an element from the `arr` list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and must have at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value incremented by 1.**
