The code snippet sets the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`, overwriting any previous value that might have been associated with `num` in the dictionary. This means that the frequency count for `num` is now exactly `k`. The values of `arr`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency_table[num]` is `k`, `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
