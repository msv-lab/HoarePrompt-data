### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to minimize the number of cards in the hand by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards. The key idea is to determine how many such exchanges can be made for each unique card number and then calculate the remaining cards.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` limits the frequency of each card to `k`. This is incorrect because the frequency should be counted accurately without any upper limit. The limitation to `k` does not help in calculating the minimum number of cards left.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - The code checks if `k` is in the frequency values and then prints `k - 1` or `n` based on that condition. This logic is flawed. The problem requires minimizing the number of cards by performing the allowed exchanges as many times as possible.

3. **Missing Core Logic**:
   - The core logic to minimize the number of cards is missing. For each unique card number, the program should calculate how many times it can perform the exchange operation (`freq // k`) and then determine the remaining cards (`freq % k + 1` if `freq % k != 0`).

#### Corrected Code:
The corrected version of the program accurately counts the frequency of each card, calculates the number of exchanges possible, and determines the minimum number of cards left after all possible exchanges. Here's the corrected approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count // k
        if count % k != 0:
            min_cards += 1
    
    print(min_cards)
```

In this corrected version:
- The frequency of each card is counted accurately.
- For each unique card number, the number of exchanges (`count // k`) is calculated.
- The remaining cards (`count % k + 1` if `count % k != 0`) are added to the total minimum number of cards.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. The corrected version addresses these issues and provides the correct solution.

**Final: False**
