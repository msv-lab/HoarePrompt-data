Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**: The function `func_1` incorrectly limits the frequency of each card to `k`. This is not necessary and does not help in calculating the minimum number of cards left. The frequency of each card should be counted accurately without any upper limit.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values and then prints `k - 1` or `n` based on that condition. This does not follow the problem's requirement to minimize the number of cards by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` cards.

3. **Missing Core Logic**: The core logic to minimize the number of cards is missing. For each unique card number, the program should calculate how many times it can perform the exchange operation (`freq // k`) and then determine the remaining cards (`freq % k + 1` if `freq % k != 0`).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count // k
        if count % k != 0:
            min_cards += 1
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected version accurately counts the frequency of each card, calculates the number of exchanges possible, and determines the minimum number of cards left after all possible exchanges.
