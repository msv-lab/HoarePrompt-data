The code snippet increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table` by 1. If `num` was not already a key in `frequency_table`, it is added with a value of 1. If `num` was already a key, its value is increased by 1. The constraints on `arr` and `k` remain unchanged, and the value of `num` is still the next element in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
