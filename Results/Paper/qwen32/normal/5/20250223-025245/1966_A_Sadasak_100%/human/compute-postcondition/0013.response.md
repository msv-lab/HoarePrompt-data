Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary where `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k` if it was originally greater than `k`, or it is incremented by 1 if it was less than or equal to `k`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
