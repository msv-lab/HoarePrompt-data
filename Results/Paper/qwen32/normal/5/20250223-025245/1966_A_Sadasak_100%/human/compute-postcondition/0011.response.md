The code snippet increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary. If `num` was not previously in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1. If `num` was already in the dictionary, its count is increased by 1. The values of `arr`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency_table[num]` is either `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was originally greater than `k`, or it is incremented by 1 if it was less than or equal to `k`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
