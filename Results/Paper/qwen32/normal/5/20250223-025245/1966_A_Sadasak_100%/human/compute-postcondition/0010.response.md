The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is the next element in `arr`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in the list after the current one.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency_table[num]` is either `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was originally greater than `k`, or it remains unchanged otherwise.
- `num` is the next element in `arr`.

To adjust the state for the start of the next iteration:
- `num` should be updated to the next element in `arr`.

Since we don't have the specific current index of `num` in `arr`, let's denote the current index as `index`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was `arr[index]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be `arr[index + 1]`.

However, since we only need to adjust the state of `num` and we don't have the exact value of `index`, we can simply state that `num` is the next element in `arr` after the current one.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency_table[num]` is either `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was originally greater than `k`, or it remains unchanged otherwise, `num` is the next element in `arr`**.
