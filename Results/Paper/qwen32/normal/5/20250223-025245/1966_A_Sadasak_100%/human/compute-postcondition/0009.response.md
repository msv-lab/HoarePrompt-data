Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency_table[num]` is either `k` if `frequency_table[num]` was originally greater than `k`, or it remains unchanged otherwise. `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
