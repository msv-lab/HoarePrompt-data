The code snippet updates the value of `b_d` to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 1, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`**.
