Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 2. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is set to 1 and `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `i` is the next element in `arr`**.

In natural language: The value of `pos` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as described in the initial state.
