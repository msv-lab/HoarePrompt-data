Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with integers, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is the position closest to the midpoint where the conditions are met, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `b_d` is the minimum distance to the midpoint where the conditions are met.**

In natural language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
