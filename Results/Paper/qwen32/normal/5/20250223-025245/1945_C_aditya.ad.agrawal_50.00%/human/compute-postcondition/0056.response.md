The given code snippet updates the `arr` variable by converting the `input_string` into a list of integers. This means `arr` will now hold the integer representation of each character in `input_string`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is updated to the input string; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is 0; `o_r` is 0; `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met; `pos` is the length of `arr`; `b_d` is the minimum distance from `n / 2` to any position `pos` where the conditions were met**

In simple terms, `arr` has been updated to be a list of integers from `input_string`, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
