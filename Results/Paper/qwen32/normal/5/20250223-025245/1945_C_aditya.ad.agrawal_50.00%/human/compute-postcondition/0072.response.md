Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001`, and `i` is not equal to 0**
