It seems like the initial state provided is incomplete or incorrect. The initial state is described as `t`, which does not provide any context or information about the variables or objects that will be used in the `print(ans)` statement. For me to determine what will be printed, I need more information about the variable `ans`.

Given the current incomplete information, I can only provide a generic response based on the assumption that `ans` is a variable that has been defined somewhere in the code (not shown here). Let's assume that `ans` has been defined and holds a certain value.

If we were to provide a generic answer, it would look something like this:

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of the variable `ans`.

Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical or string value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable ans)**

If you can provide more details about the initial state or the value of `ans`, I can give a more precise answer.
