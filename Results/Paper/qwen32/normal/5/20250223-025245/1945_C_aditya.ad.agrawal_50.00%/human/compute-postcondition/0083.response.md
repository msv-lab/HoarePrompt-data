The code snippet provided is `z_r -= 1`. This means that the value of `z_r` is decremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the decrement of `z_r` while all other variables retain their initial state values.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `z_l` is incremented by 1, `z_r` is decremented by 1**.
