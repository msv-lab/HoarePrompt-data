The code snippet assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. The value of `pos` is 3, so `ans` will be 3. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is either 2 or 3, `o_l` is 2, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 2, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1. If `i` is not 0, `z_l` is 1 or 2, `o_l` is 3 or 2, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 2. `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 3, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is 3.**
