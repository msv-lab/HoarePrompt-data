The code snippet provided increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Given the initial state, `o_l` is either 1 or 2. If `i` was 0, `o_l` was 2; otherwise, it was 1. After the increment, if `i` was 0, `o_l` becomes 3, and if `i` was not 0, `o_l` becomes 2.

Other variables remain unchanged based on the provided code snippet. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1 if `i` was 0, otherwise `z_l` is 2, `o_l` is 3 if `i` was 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 2, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 2, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 3, `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
