Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters '0' and '1'. It calculates and prints the position in the string where the counts of '0's (left side preference) and '1's (right side preference) are balanced as closely as possible around the midpoint of the string.**
