The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. The values of `j`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
