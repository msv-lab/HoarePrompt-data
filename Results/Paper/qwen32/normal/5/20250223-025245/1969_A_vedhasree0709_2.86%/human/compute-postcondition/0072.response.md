Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `l` is a new list of integers read from the input. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `j`, `i`, `n`, or `l`.**
