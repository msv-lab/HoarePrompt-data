Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `l[2]` equals 4 and `l[3]` equals 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without modification to `j`, `i`, `n`, or `l`.**
