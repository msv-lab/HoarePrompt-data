The value of `j` is set to 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The current value of `l[i]` is still `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is still `i + 1`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2`, and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1`.**
