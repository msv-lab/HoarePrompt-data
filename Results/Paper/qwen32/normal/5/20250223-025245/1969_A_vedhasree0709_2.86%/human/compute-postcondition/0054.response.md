The `print(3)` statement will output the integer `3` regardless of the values of `j`, `i`, `n`, or `l` because the print statement is explicitly printing the number `3`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:
1. The variable `j` is set to `0`, but it is not used in the print statement.
2. The variable `i` is set to `n` when the loop exits, but it is not used in the print statement.
3. The variable `n` is the input integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
4. The variable `l` is the input list, but it is not used in the print statement.

Since none of these variables are referenced in the print statement, the output is simply the number `3`.

Output: **3**
