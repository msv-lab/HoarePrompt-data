Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
