The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the user input. The variables `j`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. Since `i` is initially set to `n-1`, and `n` is being reassigned, `i` will now be `n-1` based on the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` remains the input list**.
