To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the given conditions and how the loop progresses.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i <= n - 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`, then:
     - `print(2)`
     - `j` is set to 1
     - The loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Given Output States for First 3 Iterations:**
   - After 1 iteration: `j` is 1 if the condition is met, otherwise `j` is 0 and `i` is 0.
   - After 2 iterations: `j` is 1 if the condition was met at any point, otherwise `j` is 0 and `i` is 2.
   - After 3 iterations: `j` is 1 if the condition was met at any point, otherwise `j` is 0 and `i` is 3.

From the given output states, we can infer that if the loop has executed 3 times, it means the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was not met in the first three iterations. Therefore, `j` remains 0 and `i` is incremented to 3.

Now, we need to consider what happens after the 3rd iteration until the loop exits. Since the loop continues as long as `i <= n - 1`, the loop will keep iterating until `i` exceeds `n - 1`.

If the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is never met for any `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the loop will complete all iterations without breaking, and `j` will remain 0. `i` will be equal to `n` when the loop exits.

**Final Output State:**
- `j` is 0 if the condition was never met.
- `i` is equal to `n` when the loop exits.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `l` remains the input list.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the input list.**

In natural language: The final state is that `j` remains 0 if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never true during any iteration. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes all iterations, and the values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial values.
