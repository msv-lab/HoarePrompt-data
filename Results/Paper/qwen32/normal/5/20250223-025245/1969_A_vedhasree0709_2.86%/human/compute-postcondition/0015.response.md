Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the code to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
