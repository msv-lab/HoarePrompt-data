The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet will output the integer `2`. This is a direct print statement that does not depend on any of the variables `j`, `i`, `n`, or `l` mentioned in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:
1. The initial state provides values and conditions for variables `j`, `i`, `n`, and the list `l`. However, these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(2)` statement is a simple print command that outputs the number `2`.

Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not require any calculation based on the provided initial state.

Output: **2**
