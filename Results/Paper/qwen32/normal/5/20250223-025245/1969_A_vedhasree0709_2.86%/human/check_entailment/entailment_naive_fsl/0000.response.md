Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic in the code is flawed and does not handle all cases as described in the problem statement.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

Explanation for the test case:
- In this case, Monocarp has 4 friends, and their best friends are given by the list `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- The program checks if there are two consecutive friends such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`.
- However, in the given test case, no such pair exists. The correct strategy is to invite friends 1, 2, and 3, which will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party (since 1's best friend is 2 and 2's best friend is 3, both of whom receive invitations).
- The program incorrectly outputs `2` for this case, which is not the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
