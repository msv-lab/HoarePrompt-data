The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is now less than `(mid + 3) // 2 + 1`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, and `n` is greater than `mid`.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2 + 1`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`**.
