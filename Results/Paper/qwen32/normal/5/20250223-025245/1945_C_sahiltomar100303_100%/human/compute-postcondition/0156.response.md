The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given the loop `for i in range(mid):`, the loop will start with `i` being 0 and will continue as long as `i` is less than `mid`. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, the loop will iterate `mid` times.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0' and 0 otherwise, `i` is 1**
