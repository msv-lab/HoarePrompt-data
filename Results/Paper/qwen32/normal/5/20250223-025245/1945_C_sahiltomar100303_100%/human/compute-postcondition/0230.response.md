The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `left` is 0
- `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0
- `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1
- `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'
- `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'
- `right` is 2
- `n` is at least 2
- `tleftZero` is -1
- `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is -1

The only variable that changes is `tleftOne`, which is incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 2; `n` is at least 2; `tleftZero` is -1; `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is -1; `tleftOne` is 1**
