The code snippet provided initializes the variable `rightOne` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 0.**
