The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `trightZero` is set to 3 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains 2, `rightOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0', and incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `i` is `mid + 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by 1**.
