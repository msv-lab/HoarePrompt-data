The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 2) // 2` and `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1.**
