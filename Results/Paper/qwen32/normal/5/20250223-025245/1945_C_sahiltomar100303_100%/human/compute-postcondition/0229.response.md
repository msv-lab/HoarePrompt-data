The code snippet `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `trightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'. Therefore, after the decrement, `trightZero` will be 1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 2; `n` is at least 2; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is -1; `trightZero` is 1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` is 1.**
