The value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `left` is 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 3, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 3, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the initial value of `leftOne` minus 3 plus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it is the initial value of `leftOne` plus 1, `tleftZero` must be less than 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 3, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 3, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - 2) // 2` and is now one less than its initial value, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is 3, and `s[right]` is '1'.**
