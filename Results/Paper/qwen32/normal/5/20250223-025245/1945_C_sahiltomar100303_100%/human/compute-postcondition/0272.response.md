The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. However, the loop will execute `t` times, so we need to adjust the state to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop head does not have any variables that affect the program state other than the loop counter `_`, the state of `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, and `trightZero` remains unchanged. The only thing that changes is the internal counter of the loop, which is represented by the loop variable `_`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly used in the loop body (it is a throwaway variable), we do not need to adjust its value in the state description. The loop will simply execute `t` times, and we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

However, since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, the state description remains the same except for the implicit decrement of `t`.

State: **`left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0. The values of `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, and `trightZero` remain unchanged from the precondition. If `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4. If `right` is equal to `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition. If `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`. If `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**
