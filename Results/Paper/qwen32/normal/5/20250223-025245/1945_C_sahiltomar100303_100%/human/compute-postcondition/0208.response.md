Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -1, `rightOne` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `rightZero` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 2, `leftOne` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 0, `n` is at least 5.**

In simple terms, the value of `left` has been decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
