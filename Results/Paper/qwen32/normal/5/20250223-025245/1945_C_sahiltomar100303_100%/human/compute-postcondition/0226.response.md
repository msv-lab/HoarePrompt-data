Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 2; `n` is at least 2. If the character at index `right` of the string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is -1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is -1.`**

In simpler terms, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
