Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1. `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `leftMove` is 0. The conditions on `leftZero` and `rightOne` are maintained as specified.**
