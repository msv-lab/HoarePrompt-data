The code snippet provided initializes a variable `leftMove` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the new variable `leftMove`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `left` is the value of `mid`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `mid` is the same as the initial value, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne`, `leftMove` is 0.**
