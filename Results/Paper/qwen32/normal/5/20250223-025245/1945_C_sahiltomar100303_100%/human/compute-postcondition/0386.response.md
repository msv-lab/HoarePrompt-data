Postcondition: **left is 0, s is "001011", leftZero is -2, leftOne is -1, mid is 3, tleftOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, rightZero is 3, rightOne is 3, trightZero is 2, trightOne is 0, leftMove is 0, right is 6. If right is not equal to n, then right remains 6. If right is equal to n, then if rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, rightOne remains unchanged; otherwise, rightOne is less than (n + 1) // 2.**
