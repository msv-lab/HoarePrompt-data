The code snippet increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `rightZero` is either 2 (if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0') or 2 (if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'). Therefore, after the increment, `rightZero` will be 3.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state is:

Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is -2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -1, `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `rightZero` is 3, `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `n` is at least 5**.
