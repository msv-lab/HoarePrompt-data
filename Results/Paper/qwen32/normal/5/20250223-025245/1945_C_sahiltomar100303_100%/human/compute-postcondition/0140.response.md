Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is at least 0. If `left` is 0, then `right` can be either `n` or less than `n`, and `trightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is `n`; otherwise, `trightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0, then `right` can be either `n` or not equal to `n`, and if `right` is `n`, `left` remains unchanged; if `right` is not `n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`. `n` is an input integer, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `leftZero` is now 0. All other variables retain their initial conditions and constraints.
