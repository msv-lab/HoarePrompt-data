Postcondition: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 2 and `tleftZero` is 2, otherwise `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and `leftOne` is incremented by 1. `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both possible conditions of the if statement.
