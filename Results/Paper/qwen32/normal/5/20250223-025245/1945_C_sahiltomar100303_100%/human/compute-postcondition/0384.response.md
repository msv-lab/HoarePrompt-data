The initial state provides specific values for several variables, and the task is to determine what will be printed when the `print(right)` statement executes. 

From the initial state, we can see that the variable `right` is explicitly set to 6. There are no conditions or formulas affecting the value of `right` in the provided snippet, so we can directly use this value.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `right` is explicitly set to 6.
2. The `print(right)` statement will output the value of `right`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(right)` statement will be the integer 6.

Output: **6**
