The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `rightOne` could be 2 if `s[i]` is not '0'. After the increment, `rightOne` will be 3 if `s[i]` is not '0'. The values of other variables (`left`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftOne`, `mid`, `i`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `trightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', `rightOne` is 3 if `s[i]` is not '0'**.
