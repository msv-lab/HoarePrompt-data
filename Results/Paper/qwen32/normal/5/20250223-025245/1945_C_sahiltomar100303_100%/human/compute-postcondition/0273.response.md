Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0. The values of `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, and `trightZero` remain unchanged. If `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4. If `right` is equal to `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition. If `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`. If `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is set to whatever integer is input by the user. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
