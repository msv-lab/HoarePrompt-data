Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `leftOne` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `n` is at least 5.**

In simple terms: The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `leftOne` becomes -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
