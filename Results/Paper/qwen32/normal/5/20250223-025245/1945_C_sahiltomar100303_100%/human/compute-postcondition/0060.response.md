Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string such that `leftZero` (count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`) is less than `n // 4 + 1` and `rightOne` (count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`)) is less than `n // 4 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`), `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`), `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`), `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`), `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, and the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'. `leftZero` is decreased by 1.**
