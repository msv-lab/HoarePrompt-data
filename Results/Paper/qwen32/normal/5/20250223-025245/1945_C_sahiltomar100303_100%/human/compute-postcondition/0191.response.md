Output State: **`left` is `mid`, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is the count of non-'0's in `s[mid:n]`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in `s[mid:n]`, `trightOne` is the count of non-'0's in `s[mid:n]`.**

In natural language: The value of `left` is now equal to `mid`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
