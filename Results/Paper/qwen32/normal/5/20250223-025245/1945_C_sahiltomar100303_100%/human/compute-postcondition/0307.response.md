The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `rightZero` is initially 1. After the increment, `rightZero` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `mid` is the same as the initial value, `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `trightZero` is 2**.
