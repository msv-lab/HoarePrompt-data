Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of the variable `left` and what will be printed by the `print(left)` statement.

From the initial state provided:
- `left` is not 0.
- `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1.
- `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'.
- `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'.
- `right` is 4, and `right` equals `n`.
- `tleftZero` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 1.
- `tleftOne` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 1.

However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `left`. It only states that `left` is not 0. Since there's no further information about the value of `left`, we can only describe it as being non-zero.

Output: **left (where left is a non-zero value)**
