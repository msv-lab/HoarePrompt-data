Each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, followed by a string a of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where a_j = 0 indicates the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 indicates the resident wants to live on the right side. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) is given at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
