The value of `right` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `right` changes from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 4; `n` is greater than 4; `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise 0; `trightOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise -1; `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise 0; `trightZero` is 0 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise 1.**
