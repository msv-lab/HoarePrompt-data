The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` was initially 2, and after the increment, `rightZero` becomes 3. `trightZero` remains 3.

If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightZero` was initially 0, and after the increment, `rightZero` becomes 1. `rightOne` remains 3, and `trightOne` remains 4.

Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 3. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 3 and `trightOne` is 4.**
