The code snippet increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is 1, and `s[i]` is not '0'**.
