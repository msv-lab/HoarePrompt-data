Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `left` is 1, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` and has been incremented by 1, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0' and `rightZero` is incremented by 1, otherwise `leftZero` is 0 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1, `leftOne` is the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `rightOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
