Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`. `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` minus 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. `n` is greater than `mid`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**
