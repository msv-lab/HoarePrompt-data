The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is used in the `range(mid, n)`. For the loop to execute, `mid` must be less than `n`. The other variables mentioned are part of the loop body or are not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust them according to the given constraints.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted so that `mid` is less than `n` for the loop to execute.

State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid`**
