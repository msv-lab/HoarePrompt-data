The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise 0. Given the initial state, `tleftOne` is either 0 or 1. After incrementing, `tleftOne` will be 1 or 2, depending on its initial value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 3; `n` must be greater than 4; `tleftZero` is 0 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise -1; `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise -1; `tleftOne` is 1 or 2; `trightZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise 1.**
