Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`; `rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]`; `mid` is the same as the initial value; `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value; `trightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`; `trightZero` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `mid` is the same as the initial value, `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 3, with `rightOne` and `trightOne` being 0. Otherwise, `s[i]` is not '0', `rightOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 1, with `rightZero` and `trightZero` being 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`. `mid` remains the same as the initial value. `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0. `s` is the value of the user's input. `leftZero` and `leftOne` are the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]` respectively, and they remain the same. `tleftOne` remains the same as the initial value. `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]` and remains the same. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 4, `trightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, and `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is the initial value of `rightOne` plus 1, `trightOne` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, and `trightZero` is 3. `i` is `mid + 1` in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`. `mid` remains the same as the initial value. `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0. `s` is the value of the user's input. `leftZero` and `leftOne` are the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]` respectively, and they remain the same. `tleftOne` remains the same as the initial value. `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]` and remains the same. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 5 if the if part is executed, or 4 if the else part is executed. `trightZero` is 2 if the if part is executed, or 1 if the else part is executed. `rightOne` is 0 if the if part is executed, or 1 if the else part is executed. `trightOne` is 0 if the if part is executed, or 2 if the else part is executed. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is the initial value of `rightOne` plus 1 if the if part is executed, or plus 2 if the else part is executed. `trightOne` is 2 if the if part is executed, or 3 if the else part is executed. `rightZero` is 0 if the if part is executed, or 1 if the else part is executed. `trightZero` is 3 in both cases. `i` is `mid + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
