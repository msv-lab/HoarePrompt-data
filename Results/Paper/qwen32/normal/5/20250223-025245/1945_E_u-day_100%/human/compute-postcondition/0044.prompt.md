You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing the permutation of length n, pos is an integer representing the index of the element k in arr, low and high are integers representing the current search range with the initial values low = 0 and high = n, st is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process, and `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is `low + 1`, `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the iterations, and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is the index of the largest element in arr that is less than or equal to k, and pos is the index of k in arr if k is found; otherwise, pos remains -1)
    #State: `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is `low + 1`, `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the iterations, and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `arr[low]` equals `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation. `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`. `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr`. `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range with initial values `low = 0` and `high = n`. `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process. The function performs a binary search to find a specific condition related to the element `k` in the permutation `arr` and returns a value based on this search.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
