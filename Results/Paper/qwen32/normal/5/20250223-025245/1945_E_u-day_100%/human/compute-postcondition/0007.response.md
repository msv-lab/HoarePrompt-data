The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process. If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 1**
