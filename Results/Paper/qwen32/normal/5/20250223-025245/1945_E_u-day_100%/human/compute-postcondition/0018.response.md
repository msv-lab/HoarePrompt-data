The code snippet adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Given that `mid` is initially set to `n // 2`, this value will be added to the set `st`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, and `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
