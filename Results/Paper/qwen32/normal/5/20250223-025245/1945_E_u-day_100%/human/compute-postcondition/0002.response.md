The given code snippet sets the variable `pos` to `-1`. This change affects the value of `pos`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process.**

In plain language, the variable `pos` has been updated to `-1`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
