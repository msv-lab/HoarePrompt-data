The `print(0)` statement in the provided code snippet will simply print the integer `0`, regardless of the values of the variables `low`, `high`, `st`, `pos`, and `arr[low]`.

Here's the breakdown of the information given in the initial state:
- `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` is `low + 1`.
- `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the iterations.
- `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`.
- The current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

Despite these variables and their descriptions, the `print` statement explicitly outputs the integer `0`. Therefore, the value of these variables does not influence the output of this particular print statement.

Output: **0**
