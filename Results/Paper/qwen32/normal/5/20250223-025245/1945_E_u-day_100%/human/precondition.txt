Each test case consists of two integers n and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) where n is the length of the permutation and x is the number to be found. The second line of each test case contains a permutation p of length n, which consists of distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
