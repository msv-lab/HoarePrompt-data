The code snippet provided sets the values of `low` and `high` to 0 and `n` respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `st`, and `pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process, and `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
