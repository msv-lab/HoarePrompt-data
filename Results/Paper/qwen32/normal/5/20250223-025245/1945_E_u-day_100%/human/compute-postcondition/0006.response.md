Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process. If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
