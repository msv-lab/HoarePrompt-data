### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a binary search algorithm. However, the array is not sorted, so we can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

#### Provided Functions:
1. **func_1()**: Reads a line of input and returns a map object of integers.
2. **func_2()**: Converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list.
3. **func_3()**: This is the main function that:
   - Reads the input values `n` and `k` (where `k` is the number to be found).
   - Reads the permutation `arr`.
   - Finds the position of `k` in `arr`.
   - Performs a binary search to find the largest index where the element is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Prints `0` if `k` is found in the list, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the index of the largest element less than or equal to `k` and the index of `k`.

#### Analysis:
The problem requires that we ensure `p_l` is equal to `x` after performing the binary search. The provided `func_3()` does not attempt to sort the array or perform any swaps to make the binary search work correctly. Instead, it simply performs a binary search on the unsorted array and prints the results based on whether it finds `k`.

This approach does not meet the problem's requirements because:
- The binary search algorithm requires the array to be sorted.
- The code does not attempt to sort the array or perform any swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
- The code only performs a binary search on the unsorted array and prints the results, which will not necessarily lead to `p_l` being equal to `x`.

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the provided `func_3()` does not implement the necessary logic to sort the array or perform the required swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

### Correctness: **False**
