The `while` loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `low` and `high` such that this condition remains true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`.
- `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
- `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `low + 1 < high`.
- If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `low` and `high` need to be adjusted so that `low + 1 < high` continues to hold true. Since the loop adjusts `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`, we need to ensure that there is still a gap between `low` and `high` after these adjustments.

Given that `low + 1 < high` must be true, one way to ensure this is to make sure `high` is at least `low + 2` after the previous iteration adjustments. Therefore, we need to adjust `low` and `high` such that this condition holds.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `high` is at least `low + 2`**.
