Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description. Let's go through the logic step-by-step:

1. The program reads `n` as the number of test cases, which is correct.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion). However, the variable names in the code are `(a, b, c)` instead of `(n, a, b)`, which can be confusing. Assuming `c` is a typo and should be `b`, we'll proceed with that understanding.
3. The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is incorrect. The variable `d` is not used correctly in the context of the problem. Instead, we need to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price `b` for two yogurts and the regular price `a` for one yogurt.
4. The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The program seems to be comparing the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `d` yogurts at the regular price, which does not make sense in this context. 
5. The program outputs either `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, which is not the correct logic for determining the minimum cost.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to calculate the minimum cost by considering the following:
- If `n` is even, the minimum cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
- If `n` is odd, the minimum cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

Here's the corrected logic in Python:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2 == 0:
            print((n // 2) * b)
        else:
            print(((n - 1) // 2) * b + a)

# Example input:
# 4
# 2 5 9
# 3 5 9
# 3 5 11
# 4 5 11

# Expected output:
# 9
# 14
# 15
# 20
```

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
