The value of `d` is assigned the result of `c / 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, and `d` is `c / 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, `d` is `c / 2`.**
