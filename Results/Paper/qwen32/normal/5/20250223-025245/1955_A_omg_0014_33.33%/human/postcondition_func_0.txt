The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, calculates `d` as `c / 2`, and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the condition `a * b < a * d`. The function processes each test case independently and outputs a result for each one.
