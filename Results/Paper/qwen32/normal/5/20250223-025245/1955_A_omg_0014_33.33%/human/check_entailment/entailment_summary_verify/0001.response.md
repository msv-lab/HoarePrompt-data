### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Minimize the cost to buy `n` yogurts.
- **Pricing Options**:
  - One yogurt for `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts for `b` burles.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It calculates `d` as `c / 2` (but `c` should be `b`).
- It prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the condition `a * b < a * d`.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Variable Misuse**:
   - The variable `c` is used in the input, but it should be `b` according to the problem description.
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is incorrect. It should be `b / 2` if `d` is meant to represent the cost per yogurt under the promotion, but this is not the correct approach.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The condition `a * b < a * d` does not make sense:
     - `a * b` is the cost of buying `b` burles for two yogurts.
     - `a * d` is the cost of buying `d` burles per yogurt, which is not a valid comparison.
   - The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost by considering the number of pairs (`n // 2`) and any remaining yogurt (`n % 2`).

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic in the program does not align with the problem's requirements. It does not compare the total cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs.

#### Correct Implementation:
The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `n * a`.
- Calculating the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible:
  - Number of pairs: `n // 2`
  - Cost for pairs: `(n // 2) * b`
  - Cost for any remaining yogurt (if `n` is odd): `(n % 2) * a`
  - Total cost for pairs and possibly one extra yogurt: `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`
- Comparing the two costs and choosing the minimum.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the misuse of variables and incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
