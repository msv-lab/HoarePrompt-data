The code snippet provided updates the value of `d` to be `c / 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 and `n` must be greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. If `a * b < a * d`, then `a * b` is less than `a * d`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2.**
