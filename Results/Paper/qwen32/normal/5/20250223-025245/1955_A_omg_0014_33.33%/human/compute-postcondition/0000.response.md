The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30. 

The variable `n` is being reassigned here, and its new value is the integer input by the user. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30. `n` is the integer input by the user.**
