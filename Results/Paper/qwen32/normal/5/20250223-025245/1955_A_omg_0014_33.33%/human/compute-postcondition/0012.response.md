To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * b)` statement, let's break down the given information and the conditions:

1. **Variables and their initial states:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
   - `d` is calculated as `c / 2`.
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is checked, but the result of this condition does not affect the `print(a * b)` statement directly.

2. **The print statement:**
   - The statement `print(a * b)` will output the product of `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state, the value of `a * b` is simply the product of the integers `a` and `b` as read from the input. The condition `if a * b < a * d` does not change the value of `a * b`; it only affects the flow of the program if there are additional statements depending on this condition.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `a * b`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as the product of `a` and `b`.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers read from the input)**
