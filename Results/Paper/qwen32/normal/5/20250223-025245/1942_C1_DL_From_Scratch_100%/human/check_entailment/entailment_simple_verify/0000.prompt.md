You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Bessie has a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- `x` vertices are already chosen.
- We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- `y` is always 0, so we cannot choose any additional vertices.

### Key Points:
- We need to form triangles using the `x` chosen vertices.
- Triangles must be formed by non-intersecting diagonals.
- The output should be the maximum number of such triangles.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program calculates the number of triangles that can be formed based on the gaps between the chosen vertices. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since `y` is always 0, it is ignored.
2. **Sorting Vertices**: The chosen vertices are sorted.
3. **Counting Gaps**: The program counts the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices that are exactly 1 (indicating that a triangle can be formed by adding a diagonal between these vertices).
4. **Handling Wrap-around**: It also checks the gap between the first and last chosen vertex, considering the wrap-around in the polygon.
5. **Calculating Triangles**: The number of triangles is calculated as the number of gaps of size 1 plus `x - 2`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Gaps of Size 1**: The program only counts gaps of size 1. However, forming triangles doesn't necessarily require gaps of size 1. For example, if the vertices are chosen such that they form a larger convex polygon, you can still form triangles by drawing diagonals inside this polygon.
- **General Triangle Formation**: The program does not account for the general case of triangle formation using any three chosen vertices, not just those with gaps of size 1.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the chosen vertices do not allow for any triangles to be formed.

### Counterexample:
Consider a test case where `n = 6`, `x = 3`, and the chosen vertices are `1`, `3`, and `5`. According to the program, the gaps between these vertices are all 2, so it would output 1 (only considering gaps of size 1). However, you can form two triangles by drawing diagonals between these vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it does not handle the general case of triangle formation and only considers gaps of size 1, which is insufficient to maximize the number of triangles.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to consider all possible ways to form triangles using the chosen vertices, particularly when the gaps between vertices are not of size 1. It also does not handle cases where the chosen vertices can form multiple triangles even if the gaps are larger than 1.
