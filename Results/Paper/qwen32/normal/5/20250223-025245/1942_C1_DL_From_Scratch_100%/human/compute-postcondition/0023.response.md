Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` was exactly 2, plus 1 if `num` was 1, and `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`. If `num` was 1, `count` is incremented by 1.**
