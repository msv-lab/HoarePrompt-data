You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates and prints a value for each test case based on the given inputs, which appears to represent the number of certain conditions met by the list of integers relative to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. We are given `x` vertices that can be used to form diagonals, and `y` is always 0 (meaning no additional vertices can be chosen). The goal is to form the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces using these `x` vertices.

### Key Observations:
1. **Triangular Pieces**: To form a triangle, we need three vertices. The given vertices can be used to form diagonals that help in creating these triangles.
2. **Non-intersecting Diagonals**: The diagonals should not intersect inside the polygon.
3. **Maximizing Triangles**: The maximum number of triangles can be formed by ensuring that we use the given vertices efficiently to create as many triangles as possible.

### Strategy:
- **Counting Adjacent Vertices**: If two vertices are adjacent (i.e., there is only one vertex between them), they can be used to form a triangle with another vertex.
- **Circular Nature**: Since the polygon is circular, we also need to consider the gap between the first and last vertex in the sorted list of chosen vertices.

### Explanation of the Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0). It then reads the `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The vertices are sorted to facilitate the counting of adjacent vertices.
3. **Counting Triangles**:
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks the gap between each pair of consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 1 (meaning the vertices are adjacent), it increments the triangle count.
   - It also checks the gap between the first and last vertex in the sorted list to account for the circular nature of the polygon.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the total count of triangles, which is `count + x - 2`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Adjacency Check**: The program correctly checks for adjacent vertices and counts them.
- **Circular Check**: It also correctly checks the gap between the first and last vertex.
- **Triangle Count**: The formula `count + x - 2` is used to calculate the number of triangles. This formula is based on the fact that each triangle uses 3 vertices, and we need to account for the fact that some vertices might be used in multiple triangles.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The formula used for counting triangles is also correct.
