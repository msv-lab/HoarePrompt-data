Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is at least 2, `y` is the third integer from the new input, `list0` is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. If `num` is equal to 1, `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.**

In simpler terms: **`T` is `T-1`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is at least 2, `y` is the third integer from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `num` is calculated as `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is set to 2; otherwise, `count` is set to 1.**
