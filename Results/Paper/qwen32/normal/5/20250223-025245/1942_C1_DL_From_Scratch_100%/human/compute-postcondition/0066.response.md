Postcondition: **`T` is T-2, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input and must be at least 3, `y` is the third integer from the new input, `list0` is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`. If `num` is 1, `count` is 3; otherwise, `count` is 2.**
