Postcondition: **T is T-1, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is the first integer from the new input, x is the second integer from the new input, y is the third integer from the new input, list0 is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input, i is x - 2, num is 1 if it was equal to 1 during the loop execution (in which case count is increased by 1), otherwise num retains its original value and count remains unchanged.**
