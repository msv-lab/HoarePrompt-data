You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. The first element of `arr` is the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent element is a test case represented as a list starting with an integer `n`, followed by two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. The sorting is done in reverse order, meaning the test case with the highest value (considering the entire sublist as a sequence) will appear first.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of lists representing test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by two lists `a` and `b` of length `n` (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of `arr` is the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The function returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order based on the entire sublist, meaning the test case with the highest value sequence will appear first.

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. The first element of `arr` is the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent element is a test case represented as a list starting with an integer `n`, followed by two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. The sorting is done in reverse order, meaning the test case with the highest value (considering the entire sublist as a sequence) will appear first.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
