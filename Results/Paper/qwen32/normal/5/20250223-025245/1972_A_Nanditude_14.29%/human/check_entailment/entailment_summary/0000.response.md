Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The program's logic attempts to insert elements from the `b` array into the `a` array when the current element in `b` is less than the current element in `a`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting `a` array will be sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion, and it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of new problems needed. 

The correct approach involves comparing the elements of `a` and `b` directly and counting how many elements in `a` exceed their corresponding elements in `b`. For each such case, a new problem must be added, and the most difficult existing problem must be removed to maintain the non-decreasing order. The provided program does not follow this logic.

Additionally, the function `func_1(arr)` is defined but never used in the program and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
