The value of `ind1` is set to 0. The values of `inpstr`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `s` are not yet assigned values, and `ind1` is 0.
Output State: **`inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `s` are not yet assigned values, `ind1` is 0**.
