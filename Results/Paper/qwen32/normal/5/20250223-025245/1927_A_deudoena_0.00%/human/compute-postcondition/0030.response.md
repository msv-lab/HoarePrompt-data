Postcondition: **`inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t` and must have at least 1 character, `i` is 2, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 2 if the second last character of `inpstr` is 'B', otherwise `ind2` remains 0, and `outind` is 0. If the second last character of `inpstr` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
