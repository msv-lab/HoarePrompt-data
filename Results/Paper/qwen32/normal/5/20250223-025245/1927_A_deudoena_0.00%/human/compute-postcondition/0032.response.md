Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`. This means `inpstr` is a string representation of some integer `t`.
- `i` is `len(inpstr) - 1`, which is the index of the last character in `inpstr`.
- `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, which is `inpstr[i]` or `inpstr[-1]`.
- `ind1` is 0.
- `ind2` is 0.
- `outind` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```
print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
```

### Analysis:
- `len(inpstr)` gives the length of the string `inpstr`, which is the number of characters in the string representation of the integer `t`.
- `ind2` and `ind1` are both 0 as per the initial state.

### Calculation:
The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` simplifies to `len(inpstr) - 0 - 0`, which is just `len(inpstr)`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the length of the string `inpstr`, which is the number of digits in the integer `t`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the length of the string representation of the integer `t`**
