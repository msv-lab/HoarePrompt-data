You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an input string representing multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints the length of the strip minus the sum of the positions of the first and last black cells ('B') in the strip.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells in the strip white. The program provided seems to attempt this by finding the first and last black cells in the string and then calculating the length of the segment between them. However, this approach does not necessarily give the correct result.

Consider the following points:
1. The program correctly identifies the index of the first 'B' (black cell) and the index of the last 'B' in the string.
2. It then calculates the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B' by using `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
3. However, this calculation does not account for the possibility that the optimal segment might not necessarily start with the first 'B' and end with the last 'B'. There might be a shorter segment that includes all black cells.

Let's analyze the example provided in the problem:

For the input "WBBWBW":
- The first 'B' is at index 1.
- The last 'B' is at index 4.
- The program calculates the segment length as `6 - 1 - 4 = 1`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 4, which is the segment from index 1 to 4 (inclusive).

This example shows that the program does not correctly find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. The correct approach would involve checking all possible segments and finding the shortest one that includes all black cells.

Thus, the given program is incorrect.

Reasoning: The program calculates the minimum segment length based on the first and last black cells, which does not guarantee the shortest segment that includes all black cells.
Correctness: **False**
