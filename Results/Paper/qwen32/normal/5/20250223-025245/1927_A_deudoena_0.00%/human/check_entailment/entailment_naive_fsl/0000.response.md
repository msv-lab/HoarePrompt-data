Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white for the entire strip to become white. The program only calculates the distance between the first and last black cell and subtracts this from the total length of the strip, which is not necessarily the minimum segment that needs to be painted white.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
WWBWB
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
Explanation of expected output: The minimum segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white is from the 3rd to the 5th cell ("BWB"), which is of length 3.

However, the given program would output:
```
3
```
But let's consider another case:
```
Input:
1
5
BWBWB
```
Expected Output:
```
5
```
Explanation of expected output: The entire strip needs to be painted white, which is of length 5.

However, the program would output:
```
3
```
This is incorrect because the entire strip needs to be painted white.

The program fails to account for scenarios where the minimum segment might be smaller than the distance between the first and last black cells, especially when there are multiple groups of black cells separated by white cells. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
