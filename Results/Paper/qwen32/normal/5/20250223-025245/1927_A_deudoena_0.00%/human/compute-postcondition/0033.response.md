Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of a strip and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. The function returns the minimum number of groups of consecutive black cells ('B') for each test case.**
