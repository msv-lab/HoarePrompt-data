Postcondition: **`inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`, `i` is 0, `j` is the first character of `inpstr`. If `j` is equal to 'B', then `ind1` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ind1` and the loop or if statement continues.**
