Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to find the first and last black cells and then calculates the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell. However, this approach does not guarantee that painting this segment will make all the cells white because there might be multiple segments of black cells that need to be considered.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the longest continuous segment of black cells, as painting this segment will ensure that all black cells are turned white. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        max_black_segment = 0
        current_black_segment = 0
        
        for cell in s:
            if cell == 'B':
                current_black_segment += 1
                max_black_segment = max(max_black_segment, current_black_segment)
            else:
                current_black_segment = 0
        
        print(max_black_segment)

func()
```

This program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads the length of the strip and the strip itself. It then iterates over the strip to find the length of the longest continuous segment of black cells and prints this length as the result for each test case.
