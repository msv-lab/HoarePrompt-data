Postcondition: **`cur` is either `num` or `cur + 1`. If `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to `cur + 1` and `M` is updated to `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, or `{-1: 1}` if `num` is less than or equal to `cur + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers. `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. If the condition is met, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
