Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, `M` is a dictionary with counts of how many times each value of `cur` was encountered or incremented, if the sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of all values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is 1, then `cnt` contains the element `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of all values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is 1, then `cnt` includes the element `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the previous `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of all values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k] == 1`, then `cnt` includes `k`. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the previous `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
