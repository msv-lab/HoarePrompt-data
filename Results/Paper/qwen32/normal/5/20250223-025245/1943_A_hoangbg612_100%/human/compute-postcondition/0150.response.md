The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Given that `k` is 2, `cnt` will now include this value. The previous state of `cnt` was `[k]` if `M[k]` is 1 for the current key `k`, otherwise `cnt` remained `[]`. Since `M[2]` is 1, `cnt` was initially `[2]`. After appending `k` (which is 2) to `cnt`, `cnt` becomes `[2, 2]`.

The values of other variables (`N`, `cur`, `M`, `S`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is 3 if the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains 2; `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is [2, 2]; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged; `k` is 2**.
