The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `cur` is -1, after the increment, `cur` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `cur` is 0, `M` is {}, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, `T` remains unchanged, `num` is greater than `cur`, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**
