The code `M[cur] += 1` modifies the dictionary `M` by incrementing the value associated with the key `cur`. Given that `cur` is initially -1, the code will create a new key -1 in the dictionary `M` with a value of 1, since `M` is initially empty.

Here's the updated state:
- `N` is still a list containing at least one element.
- `cur` remains -1.
- `M` now contains the key -1 with a value of 1.
- `S` remains the input integer.
- `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1. Since `M[cur]` was incremented to 1, `cnt` will now contain -1.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `num` is still less than or equal to `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `cur` is -1, `M` is {-1: 1}, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is [-1], `T` remains unchanged, and `num` is less than or equal to -1.**
