Postcondition: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `cur` is 0 if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, otherwise `cur` remains -1, `M` is {}, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, `T` remains unchanged, and `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
