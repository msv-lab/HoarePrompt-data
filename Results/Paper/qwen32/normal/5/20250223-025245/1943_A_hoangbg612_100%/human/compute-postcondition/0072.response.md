Output State: **`cur` is `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with either `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, or `{-1: 1}` if `num` is less than or equal to `cur + 1`. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least two integers. `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The dictionary `M`'s condition is re-evaluated based on the new value of `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged.
