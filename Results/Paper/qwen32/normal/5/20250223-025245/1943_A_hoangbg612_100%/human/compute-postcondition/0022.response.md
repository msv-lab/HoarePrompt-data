The code snippet `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to the variable `cur`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `num` is `num_next`, and `cur` is updated to this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `num_next`, `cur` is `num_next`, `M` is a dictionary with the key -1 having a value of 1.**
