Postcondition: **`cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts. `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, and `T` remains unchanged. `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input.**
