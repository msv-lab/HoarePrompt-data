Postcondition: **`cur` is either `num + 1` or `0`. If `num > cur`, then `M` is `{num: 1}`. If `cur` is `num` after the else, `M` is `{num: 2}`. If `cur` is `-1` after the else, `M` is `{-1: 2}`. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers, and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `num > cur + 1`.**
