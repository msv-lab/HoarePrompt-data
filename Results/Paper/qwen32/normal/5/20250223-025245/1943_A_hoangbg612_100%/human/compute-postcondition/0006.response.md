The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `M`. The initial state of other variables is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary.**
