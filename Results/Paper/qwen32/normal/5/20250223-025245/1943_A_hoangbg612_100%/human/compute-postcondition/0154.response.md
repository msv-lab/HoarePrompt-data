Postcondition: **`N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is 3 if the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains 2; `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1} if `M[k]` is not 1, otherwise `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is [2, 2] if `M[k]` is not 1, otherwise `cnt` is [2, 2, 2]; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged; `k` is 2.**

In simpler terms: `N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is 3 if the sum of `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` is 2; `M` remains {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is [2, 2, 2] if `M[k]` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is [2, 2]; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged; `k` is 2.
