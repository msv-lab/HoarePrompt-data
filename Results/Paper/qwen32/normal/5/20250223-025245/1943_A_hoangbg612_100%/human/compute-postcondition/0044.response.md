The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the current key `k` to the list `cnt`. This means that `cnt` will now include the key `k` in addition to any elements it previously contained. 

The initial state specifies that `cnt` contains `k` if `M[k]` is 1, otherwise it remains an empty list. However, since the code explicitly appends `k` to `cnt`, the new state of `cnt` will include `k` regardless of the value of `M[k]`.

Output State: **`cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of all values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list that now includes the element `k`. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the previous `k`.**
