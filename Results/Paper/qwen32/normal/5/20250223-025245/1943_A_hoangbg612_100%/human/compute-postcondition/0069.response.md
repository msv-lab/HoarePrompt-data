Output State: **`cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**

Explanation: The value of `cur` remains -1. The dictionary `M` now has the key `-1` with the value `1` because `M[cur]` was incremented by 1. The other variables (`S`, `cnt`, `T`, `N`, `num`) remain unchanged.
