Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained by splitting the string `s`.
- `t` is at least 3.
- `s` is the third line from the input file.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

### Analysis:
- The list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` generates a list containing the value `k`, repeated `k` times.
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list, so each element of the list is printed as a separate argument, separated by spaces.

### Example:
If `k` is 5, the list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` will produce `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. When unpacked in the `print` function, it will print `5 5 5 5 5`.

### General Case:
Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, the output will be `k` repeated `k` times.

### Output Description:
The code prints the integer `k`, repeated `k` times, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **k k k ... k (where k is repeated k times)**

Since we don't have the specific value of `k`, we describe it in terms of `k` itself.
