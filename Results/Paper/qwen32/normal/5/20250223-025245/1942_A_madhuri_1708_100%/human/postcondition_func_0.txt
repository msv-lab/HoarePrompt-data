The function reads a number of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a sequence of numbers based on the conditions: if `k` is at least 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times; if `k` is at least 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`; if `k` is less than 2, it prints numbers from 1 to `n`.
