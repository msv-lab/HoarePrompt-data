Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is `int(s1)`, but its specific value is not necessary for this print statement.
- `k` is `int(s2)`, and it is given that `n` is equal to `k`.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
- There are at least two lines in the input file, meaning `t` is at least 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

### Analysis:
- The list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` generates a list where the value `k` is repeated `k` times.
- Since `k` is the number of repetitions, the list will contain `k` elements, each of which is the value of `k`.

For example:
- If `k` is 2, the list will be `[2, 2]`.
- If `k` is 3, the list will be `[3, 3, 3]`.

- The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the list, so each element of the list will be printed separated by a space.

### Output:
Given that `k` is at least 2 and the list comprehension repeats `k` exactly `k` times, the output will be `k` printed `k` times, separated by spaces.

Output: **k k k ... k (where k is repeated k times)**

Since the exact value of `k` is not given, we describe the output in terms of `k`. If `k` were a specific number, we could substitute that number in place of `k`.

Output: **k k ... k (where k is repeated k times)**
