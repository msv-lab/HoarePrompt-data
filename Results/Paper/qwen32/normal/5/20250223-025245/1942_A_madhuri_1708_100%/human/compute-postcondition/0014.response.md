In this task, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement given the initial state. Let's break down the information provided:

- `n` and `k` are integers read from the next line of the input file.
- `t` is at least 2 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `s` is the next line from the input file.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('-1')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'-1'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, or `s`. Therefore, the output is not dependent on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **-1**
