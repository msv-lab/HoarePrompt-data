Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shift**: For a given array `a`, the `x`-th cyclic shift is defined as `a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, ..., a_{x-1}`.
3. **Objective**: Find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for each `1 <= i <= n`.
   - `1 <= k <= n <= 10^3`.
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `10^3`.
5. **Output**: If such an array exists, print it; otherwise, print `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided Python program processes multiple test cases. For each test case with given `n` and `k`, it attempts to determine if a valid array exists and prints it or `-1` if no such array exists.

#### Case 1: `k >= 2`
- **Sub-case 1**: `n == k`
  - The program constructs an array of length `n` where all elements are equal to `k`. This array will have exactly `n` (which equals `k`) sorted cyclic shifts because all cyclic shifts are identical.
  - **Example**: `n = 3, k = 3`, array `[3, 3, 3]` has all 3 cyclic shifts sorted.
- **Sub-case 2**: `n != k`
  - The program outputs `-1` because if `n > k`, it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts with all elements being equal. If `n < k`, it's invalid as `k` cannot be greater than `n`.
  - **Example**: `n = 3, k = 2`, no valid array can have exactly 2 out of 3 cyclic shifts sorted if all elements are the same.

#### Case 2: `k < 2`
- The program constructs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array is sorted, and its only sorted cyclic shift is the array itself.
  - **Example**: `n = 3, k = 1`, array `[1, 2, 3]` has only 1 sorted cyclic shift.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where `k >= 2` and `k < 2`:
- For `k >= 2` and `n == k`, it correctly outputs an array with all elements equal to `k`.
- For `k >= 2` and `n != k`, it correctly outputs `-1`.
- For `k < 2`, it correctly outputs the sorted array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
