Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to generate an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it meets the requirements.

1. **When `k >= 2`**:
   - If `n == k`, the program outputs an array where every element is `k`. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 3`, it outputs `[3, 3, 3]`. In this case, all cyclic shifts are sorted because all elements are the same, so this part is correct.
   - If `n != k`, the program outputs `-1`. This is correct because it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n != k` and `k >= 2`. If `n > k`, there are not enough distinct sorted shifts to meet the requirement, and if `n < k`, it is impossible to have more sorted shifts than the length of the array.

2. **When `k < 2`**:
   - If `k = 1`, the program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is a sorted array, and thus, only its first cyclic shift is sorted. This meets the requirement for `k = 1`.
   - If `k = 0`, the problem statement does not make sense since having zero sorted cyclic shifts is not possible for a non-empty array. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly, but since the problem guarantees `1 <= k <= n`, this case won't occur.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
