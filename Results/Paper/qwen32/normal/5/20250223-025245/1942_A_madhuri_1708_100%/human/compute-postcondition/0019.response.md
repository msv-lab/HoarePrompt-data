The code snippet reads a string `s` and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`. Therefore, `n` and `k` are updated to the values obtained from splitting `s`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers obtained by splitting the string `s`; `t` is at least 3; `s` is the third line from the input file.**
