Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program provided attempts to solve this by handling two cases based on the value of `k`.

### Case 1: `k >= 2`
- If `k` equals `n`, the program outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`. This is correct because all cyclic shifts of an array with identical elements are sorted.
- If `k` is less than `n`, the program outputs `-1`. This is also correct because it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts if `k < n` and `k >= 2`. If we have more than one sorted shift, the array must have some structure, and it's not possible to have exactly `k` sorted shifts where `k < n` without violating the conditions of the problem.

### Case 2: `k < 2`
- If `k` is 1, the program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is a sorted array, and its only sorted cyclic shift is the array itself. This is correct.
- If `k` is 0, the program does not handle this case explicitly, but since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1, this is not a concern here.

### Handling Edge Cases
- The program correctly handles the case where `k = n` by outputting an array with all elements equal to `k`.
- The program correctly outputs `-1` when `k < n` and `k >= 2`, as no valid array can satisfy these conditions.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and edge cases. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
