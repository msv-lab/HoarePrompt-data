The given code snippet contains a list comprehension that generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. The list comprehension `[(j + 1) for j in range(n)]` iterates over each integer `j` from 0 to `n-1` (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
2. For each `j`, it calculates `j + 1`, effectively generating a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list and prints each element separated by a space.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer read from the input, the exact numerical values printed will depend on the value of `n`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the integer read from the input)**
