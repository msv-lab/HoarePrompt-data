Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
We need to find an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, we should output \(-1\).

### Key Observations
1. **Sorted Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift of an array is sorted if the elements in the shift are in non-decreasing order.
2. **Constraints**:
   - \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed 1000.

### Analysis of the Program
The program processes each test case as follows:
1. **When \(k \geq 2\)**:
   - If \(n = k\), the program outputs an array where all elements are equal to \(k\). This ensures that all cyclic shifts are identical and thus sorted.
   - If \(n \neq k\), the program outputs \(-1\). This is because itâ€™s not possible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(k \neq n\) for arrays of length \(n\). If \(k < n\), at least one cyclic shift will be unsorted, and if \(k > n\), it's impossible to have more sorted shifts than the number of elements.
2. **When \(k = 1\)**:
   - The program outputs the array \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\). This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself, and all other cyclic shifts are unsorted.

### Verification Against Test Cases
Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: \(n = 2, k = 2\)
   - The program outputs `1 1`, which is correct because both cyclic shifts \([1, 1]\) and \([1, 1]\) are sorted.

2. **Test Case 2**: \(n = 3, k = 1\)
   - The program outputs `1 2 3`, which is correct because only one cyclic shift \([1, 2, 3]\) is sorted.

3. **Test Case 3**: \(n = 3, k = 2\)
   - The program outputs `-1`, which is correct because it's impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts out of 3 for an array of length 3.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all given test cases and adheres to the problem's constraints and requirements. 

**Correctness: True**
