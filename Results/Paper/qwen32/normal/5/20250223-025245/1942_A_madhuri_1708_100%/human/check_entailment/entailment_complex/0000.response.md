Let's analyze the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to construct an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. Here are the key points:

1. **Sorted Array**: An array is sorted if its elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: For an array `a` of length `n`, the `x`-th cyclic shift is `a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, ..., a_{x-1}`.
3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 1000.

### Conditions for the Solution

- **If `k == n`**: All cyclic shifts need to be sorted. This can be achieved by making the entire array the same number, as all shifts will be identical and sorted.
- **If `k == 1`**: Only one cyclic shift needs to be sorted. This can be achieved by making the array strictly increasing, as only the original array will be sorted.
- **If `1 < k < n`**: This case is tricky. It's not possible to have exactly `k` cyclic shifts sorted for `1 < k < n` with the given constraints. The sorted property of cyclic shifts is quite restrictive and does not allow for an exact count of `k` sorted shifts in this range.

### Program Analysis

The given program handles the following cases:

1. **If `k >= 2`**:
   - **If `n == k`**: It prints the number `k` repeated `k` times. This satisfies the condition where all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - **If `n != k`**: It prints `-1`, which is correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for `1 < k < n`.
2. **If `k < 2`**:
   - **If `k == 1`**: It prints numbers from `1` to `n`. This satisfies the condition where only the original array is sorted.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all possible cases according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
