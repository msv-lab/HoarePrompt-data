### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program and check if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Case when \( k \geq 2 \):**
    - **Sub-case when \( n = k \):**
        - The program prints an array where all elements are equal to \( k \). For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \), the output will be \( 3 3 3 \).
        - All cyclic shifts of this array are identical and sorted. Therefore, exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted, which meets the requirement.
    - **Sub-case when \( n \neq k \):**
        - The program outputs `-1` indicating no such array exists.
        - This is correct because if \( n \neq k \) and \( k \geq 2 \), it is not possible to have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. If \( n > k \), there will be more than \( k \) cyclic shifts, and if \( n < k \), it's impossible to have \( k \) sorted shifts since \( k \) cannot be greater than \( n \).

2. **Case when \( k = 1 \):**
    - The program prints an array where elements are in strictly increasing order from 1 to \( n \). For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the output will be \( 1 2 3 \).
    - Only the first cyclic shift (which is the array itself) is sorted. All other cyclic shifts are not sorted because they break the sorted order. Therefore, exactly one cyclic shift is sorted, which meets the requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem statement. It provides valid arrays for the cases where \( k = 1 \) and \( n = k \) when \( k \geq 2 \), and correctly outputs `-1` for other cases where a valid array cannot be formed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
