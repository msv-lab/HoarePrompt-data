Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10³. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10³.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k >= 2:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            print('-1')
    else:
        print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is `int(s1)`, `k` is `int(s2)`, and there are at least two lines in the input file (meaning `t` is at least 2). If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is equal to `k` if initially `n` was equal to `k`; otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k` is less than 2, then the condition `k < 2` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the next line of the input file, `t` is at least 2, and `s` is the next line from the input file. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged regardless of whether `k` is greater than or equal to 2 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are the two integers obtained by splitting the string `s`; `t` is at least 3; `s` is the third line from the input file. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, and `s` remain unchanged regardless of whether `k` is greater than or equal to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
