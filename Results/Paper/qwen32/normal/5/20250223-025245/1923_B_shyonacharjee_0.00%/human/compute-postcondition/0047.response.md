Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is True, `position` is the position of the first monster in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the first monster in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the last position, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `i` is 0`**

In natural language: The value of `distance` has been updated to be the absolute value of `position`. All other variables retain their initial values.
