Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by space; `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space; `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer; `healths` is a list of integers; `positions` is a list of integers; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`; `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `success` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is an integer; `healths` is a list of integers; `positions` is a list of integers; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`; `position` is the position from the 2nd index of `monsters`; `health` is the health from the 2nd index of `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + health > time_available`, otherwise `success` remains unchanged; `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is an integer; `healths` is a list of integers; `positions` is a list of integers; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + 2 * health`; `position` is the position from the 3rd index of `monsters`; `health` is the health from the 3rd index of `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + 2 * health > time_available`, otherwise `success` remains unchanged; `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
