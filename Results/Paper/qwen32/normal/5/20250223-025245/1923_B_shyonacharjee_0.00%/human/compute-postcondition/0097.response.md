Output State: **`t` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is `bullets_needed`; `position` is the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `time_available` is the absolute value of the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_needed` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `i` is 1; `success` is False.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `success`, which is now explicitly set to `False`.
