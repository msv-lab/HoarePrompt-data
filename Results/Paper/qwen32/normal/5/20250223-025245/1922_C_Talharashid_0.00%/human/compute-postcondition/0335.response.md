Postcondition: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `0`; `end` is `1`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` is updated with `d2[0] = s`; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`; otherwise, `mini` retains its initial value of `11111111` or the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and `11111111` if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
