The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `start` and `end`. The variables `i` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input, `end` is the second integer from the input.**
