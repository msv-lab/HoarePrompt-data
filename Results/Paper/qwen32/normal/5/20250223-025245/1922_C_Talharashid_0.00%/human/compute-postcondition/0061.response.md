The code snippet only increments the value of `s` by 1. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `mini`, and `d1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`.**
