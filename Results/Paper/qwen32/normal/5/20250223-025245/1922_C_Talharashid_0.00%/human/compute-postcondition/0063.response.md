Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to include the minimum difference with `lst[start - 1]`. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**

In simpler terms, the value of `s` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
