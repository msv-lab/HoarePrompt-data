Postcondition: **`start` is 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[1]` set to `s` and `d1[2]` set to `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element, `s` is incremented by 1 or `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])` based on the condition provided. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and the previous value of `mini`. If `start - 1` is not greater than -1, `mini` remains unchanged.**
