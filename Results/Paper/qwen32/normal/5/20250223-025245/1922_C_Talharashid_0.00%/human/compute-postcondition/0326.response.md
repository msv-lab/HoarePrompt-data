The code snippet `s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` remains `m + 1`
- `start` is `1`
- `end` is `0`
- `inc` is `-1`
- `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values
- `d2` is updated with `d2[start] = s`
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])` and `11111111` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and `11111111`
- `lst` remains unchanged
- `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged

With `start` being `1` and `inc` being `-1`, the expression `lst[start + inc]` evaluates to `lst[0]`. Therefore, `s` is updated by adding `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`.

Output State: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` is updated with `d2[start] = s`; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])` and `11111111` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and `11111111`; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged; `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`.**
