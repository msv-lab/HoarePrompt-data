Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 1 if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `mini` is recalculated as `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise it remains the minimum of `11111111`, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[start]` set to `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is 2, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[1]` set to `s` and `d1[2]` set to `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`. In both cases, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`, `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`, and 11111111. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])` and `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`. Otherwise, no change is made to `mini`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is 2, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[1]` set to `s` and `d1[2]` set to the current value of `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element, `mini` remains unchanged if `start - 1` is not greater than -1; otherwise, `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and the previous value of `mini`, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
