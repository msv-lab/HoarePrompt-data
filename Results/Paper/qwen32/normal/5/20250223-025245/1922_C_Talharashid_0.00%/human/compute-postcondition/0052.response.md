To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `start` and `end`. The loop condition is `start != end`, so we need to make sure that `start` and `end` are not equal.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `end` is 0

To make the loop execute, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end`. The initial values already satisfy this condition (assuming `lst` has more than one element, so `len(lst) - 1` is not 0). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `s` is 0; `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration; `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`**
