Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if the first integer from the input is less than the second integer from the input, otherwise `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `s1` is now updated to be the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
