The code snippet initializes a new variable `s` to 0. The values of the other variables (`i`, `m`, `start`, `end`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is 0.**
