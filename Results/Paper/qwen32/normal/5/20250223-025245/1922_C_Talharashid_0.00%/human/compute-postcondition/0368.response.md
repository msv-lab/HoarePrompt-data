Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is 0. If the first integer from the input is less than the second integer from the input, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Explanation: The values of `start` and `end` are updated to be the first and second integers from the input, respectively, minus 1. The values of `i`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. The conditions for `s1` and `s2` are still dependent on the original values of `start` and `end` before they were adjusted, so they are recalculated based on the new values of `start` and `end`.
