The code snippet provided reads two integers from input and assigns them to the variables `start` and `end`. The initial values of `start` and `end` are both `0`, but after the execution of the code, they will hold the values provided by the input.

Given that `input().split()` returns a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer, the values of `start` and `end` will be the first and second integers from the input, respectively.

Other variables such as `inc`, `s`, `mini`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`start` is the first integer from input, `end` is the second integer from input, `inc` is -1, `s` is the accumulated sum of absolute differences or increments, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` must be greater than `0`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged**.
