The code snippet provided updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Given the initial state, `mex` is initially set to the input integer `n`. After executing the line `mex = min(mex, p[i])`, the value of `mex` will be the smaller of `n` and `p[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[i]` updated to `n - a[i]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`.**
