The given code snippet assigns the value `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`. Since `mex` is the input integer `n`, `p[i]` will be updated to `n - a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the other elements of `p` remain unchanged except for `p[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[i]` updated to `n - a[i]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the input integer `n`.**
