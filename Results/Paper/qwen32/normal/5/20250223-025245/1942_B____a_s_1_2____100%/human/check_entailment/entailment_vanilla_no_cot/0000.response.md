Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). The program attempts to work backwards from the end of the array, but this approach does not guarantee that the constructed \( p \) will be a valid permutation with the correct MEX values.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX (minimum non-negative integer not in the array) should be calculated dynamically as the permutation \( p \) is being constructed, not just by decrementing the current MEX value.
2. **Backward Construction**: The program tries to construct \( p \) from the end to the beginning, which is not a straightforward or correct approach for this problem. The MEX value for the first elements of \( p \) depends on the values of the subsequent elements, and constructing it in reverse order can lead to incorrect results.

To correctly solve the problem, you should construct the permutation \( p \) from the beginning, ensuring that at each step, the MEX value is correctly calculated and used to determine the next element of \( p \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = [False] * n
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Find the correct p[i] such that MEX(p[0..i-1]) - p[i] = a[i]
            while used[mex]:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used[p[i]] = True
            mex += 1
        
        print(*p)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX value is dynamically calculated and used correctly to construct the permutation \( p \).
