The code snippet initializes the list `p` with `-1` repeated `n` times. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or the initial state of `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with all elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`.**

In simpler terms, the list `p` is now filled with `-1` values, while all other variables retain their initial values.
