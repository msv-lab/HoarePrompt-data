The given line of code updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `mex` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and `p[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
