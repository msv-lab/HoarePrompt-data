To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, we need to understand how the list `p` is constructed based on the initial state and the given logic.

### Steps to Determine the Output:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 1\).
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n`.
   - `p` is an initially empty list that will be populated.
   - `mex` is initialized to 0 (since `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `p` and `p` is initially empty).

2. **Construction of `p`**:
   - For each element in `a`, compute `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` after each calculation.
   - Append `p[i]` to the list `p`.

3. **Determine `mex`**:
   - `mex` starts at 0.
   - After each element `a[i]` is processed, `mex` is updated to be the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's assume `n = 3` and `a = [2, 1, 3]` for simplicity.

- **Step 1**: `i = 0`, `a[0] = 2`, `mex = 0`. Compute `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 0 - 2 = -2`. Update `p` to `[-2]`. Update `mex` to be the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`, which is `0`.
- **Step 2**: `i = 1`, `a[1] = 1`, `mex = 0`. Compute `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 0 - 1 = -1`. Update `p` to `[-2, -1]`. Update `mex` to be the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`, which is `0`.
- **Step 3**: `i = 2`, `a[2] = 3`, `mex = 0`. Compute `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 0 - 3 = -3`. Update `p` to `[-2, -1, -3]`. Update `mex` to be the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`, which is `0`.

After processing all elements in `a`, the list `p` will be `[-2, -1, -3]`.

### General Case:

Given the logic, the list `p` will contain values calculated as `mex - a[i]` for each `a[i]` in `a`, with `mex` being updated to the smallest non-negative integer not in `p` after each step.

### Final Output:

The `print(*p)` statement will print all elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **-2, -1, -3 (where p is constructed as described above based on the input list a)**

Since the exact input list `a` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of the construction process.

Output: **p (where p is constructed such that each p[i] = mex - a[i] and mex is updated to the smallest non-negative integer not in p after each step)**
