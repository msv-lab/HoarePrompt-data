Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as described in the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
Given an array `a` of length `n`, we need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each `i` (from 1 to n), `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` denotes the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n` (length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`).
   - It reads the array `a` of length `n`.
   - It initializes an array `p` of length `n` with -1.
   - It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`.
   - It iterates over the indices of `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`), calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
   - It prints the constructed `p`.

### Correctness Analysis
The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how the `MEX` value changes as `p` is constructed. The program attempts to construct `p` by working backwards from the end of `a` to the beginning. This approach is not correct for the following reasons:

1. **Reverse Construction Issue**: The program starts from the end of `a` and works backward. However, the `MEX` value at position `i` in `p` depends on the values of `p` from `1` to `i-1`. By constructing `p` in reverse, the program does not correctly account for the `MEX` value at each step.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The `mex` variable is initialized to `n` and is supposed to represent the smallest non-negative integer not yet in `p`. However, the program incorrectly updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` after calculating `p[i]`. This does not correctly reflect the `MEX` value at each step.

3. **Negative Values in p**: The program allows negative values in `p`, which is not possible since `p` is a permutation of integers from `0` to `n-1`.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve constructing `p` from the beginning to the end, maintaining a set of used values to determine the `MEX` at each step. This would ensure that the `MEX` is correctly calculated and that `p` remains a valid permutation.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`.

**Correctness: False**
