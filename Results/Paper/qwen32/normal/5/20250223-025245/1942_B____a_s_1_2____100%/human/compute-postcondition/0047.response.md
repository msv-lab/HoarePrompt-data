Let's analyze the loop and determine the output state after all iterations are completed.

The loop iterates from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`. In each iteration, it updates the `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]` and then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the final output state after all iterations:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 (unchanged).
   - `n` is the input integer (unchanged).
   - `a` is the input list of integers (unchanged).
   - `p` is a list of integers initialized to -1.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
   - After updating `p[i]`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `p` will have `p[i]` updated to `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `mex` will be the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values after the loop finishes.

The final `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `p` after all updates. Since `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` keeps reducing, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the input list of integers; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` after all iterations; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p` after all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `p` will have each element set to `mex - a[i]` for each index `i`, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `p`.
