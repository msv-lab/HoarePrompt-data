The code snippet initializes a list `p` with `-1` repeated `n` times. This affects the variable `p` while the values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `-1` repeated `n` times.**
