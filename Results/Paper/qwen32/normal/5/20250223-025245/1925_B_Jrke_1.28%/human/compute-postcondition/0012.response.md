The code snippet `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `l` is initially `[1]`. After appending `i`, `l` will be `[1, i]`.

All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and the condition `x % i == 0` with `i <= k`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, and `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`). `ans` is `1`. `l` is `[1, i]`. `x % i == 0`, meaning `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
