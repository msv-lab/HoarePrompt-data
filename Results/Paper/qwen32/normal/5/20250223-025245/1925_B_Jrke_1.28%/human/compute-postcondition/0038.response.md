The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

After executing the code snippet `x, n = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `x` and `n` will be updated to the integers provided in the input. The values of `t`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.**
