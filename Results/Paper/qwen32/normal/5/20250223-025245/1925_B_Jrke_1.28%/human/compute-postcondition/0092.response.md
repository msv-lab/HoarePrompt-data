The code snippet `l = [ans]` creates a new list `l` with a single element, which is the value of `ans`. This operation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state except for `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `l` is a list containing the value `ans`.**
