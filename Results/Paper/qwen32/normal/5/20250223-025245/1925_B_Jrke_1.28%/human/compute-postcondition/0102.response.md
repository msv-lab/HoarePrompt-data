Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least `4`, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `i` is `i + 2` if `i <= k`. The list `l` contains the value of `ans` and `i` if `i <= k`; otherwise, `l` contains only the value of `ans`.**
