Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus `2` (if `i + 2` is less than or equal to `int(x)`), and `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the current value of `x // i`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged with their previous values.
