The code appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `i_prev + 2`. The list `l` will now include this new value.

Here are the updated values:
- `l` now contains its previous values plus `x // i`.
- `ans` will be updated to the maximum value in the updated list `l`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which now includes `x // i`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`. If `i <= k`, then `l` contains its previous values plus `i` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged except for the addition of `x // i`.**
