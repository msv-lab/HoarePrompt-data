To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3` (though `t` is not used in the given code snippet, it's a constraint for the number of test cases).
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is calculated as `x // n` (integer division). If `k` equals `1`, it is explicitly set to `1`.
- `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Calculations:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, i.e., `k = x // n`.
   - If `k` is `1`, it remains `1`.

2. **Determine `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - To find `ans`, we need to check divisors of `x` starting from `k` downwards until we find a divisor.

### Explanation:
- The value of `ans` depends on the values of `x` and `n`.
- We need to find the largest divisor of `x` that does not exceed `k`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `x = 20` and `n = 5` for the sake of an example:
- `k = x // n = 20 // 5 = 4`.
- Now, we need to find the largest divisor of `20` that is less than or equal to `4`.
- The divisors of `20` are: `1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20`.
- The largest divisor of `20` that is less than or equal to `4` is `4`.

### General Case:
Given the initial state, `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of `ans`, which is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
