The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Therefore, the list `l` will now contain the previous maximum value `ans` and the new value `i`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least `4`, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing the values `ans` and `i`.**
