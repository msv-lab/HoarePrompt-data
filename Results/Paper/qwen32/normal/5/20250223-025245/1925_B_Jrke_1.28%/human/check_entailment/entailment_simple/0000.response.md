### Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset consisting of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`. The strategy is to find the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k = x // n`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `k = x // n` is 1, the maximum balance is 1 because the only way to split `x` into `n` parts is if each part is 1, and `gcd(1, 1, ..., 1)` (n times) is 1.

3. **Finding the Maximum Divisor**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all odd divisors of `x` (starting from 1 + (1 if `x` is even else 0) up to the square root of `x`).
   - For each divisor `i`, if `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`, it is considered as a potential candidate for `ans`.
   - Similarly, the corresponding quotient `x // i` is also considered if it is less than or equal to `k`.
   - The maximum of these candidates is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints `ans`, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance by checking all possible divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`. The approach ensures that the GCD of the sub-problem difficulties is maximized.

- **Base Case**: When `k` is 1, the program correctly outputs 1.
- **General Case**: The program efficiently finds the maximum divisor of `x` that is feasible as a sub-problem difficulty, ensuring the GCD is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.

**Correctness: True**
