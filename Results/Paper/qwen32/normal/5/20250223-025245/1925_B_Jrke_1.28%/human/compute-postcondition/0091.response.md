To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the loop head variables: `i` and the loop's range parameters. The loop iterates over odd values starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the integer part of the square root of `x`, incrementing by 2 each time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`.
- `x` is at least 4.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is `x // n`.
- `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.
- The list `l` is updated based on the divisibility of `x` by `i` and the conditions provided.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To find the state at the start of the next iteration:
1. The current value of `i` is incremented by 2.
2. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given that the loop increments `i` by 2, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 2`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `l`) are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is `i + 2`**

However, to provide a more precise state, we need the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration. Assuming `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**

Without the exact value of `i_prev`, we can only express the next state in terms of `i_prev`. If you provide the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, I can give you a more concrete state.
