Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least `4`, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is `i + 2` if `i <= k` (otherwise `i` remains unchanged). If `x // i <= k`, the list `l` contains the value of `ans`, `i` if `i <= k` (otherwise just `ans`), and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` contains only the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` has been recalculated as the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. All other variables retain their previous states.
