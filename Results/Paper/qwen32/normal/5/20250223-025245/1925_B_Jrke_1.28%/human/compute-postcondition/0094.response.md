Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `i` is `i_prev + 2`. If `i <= k`, then the list `l` contains its previous values plus `i`. Otherwise, the list `l` remains unchanged.**
