Given the initial state described, let's break down the variables and conditions:

- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`. This indicates the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the print statement.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is calculated as `x // n` (integer division of `x` by `n`).
- It is explicitly stated that `k` equals 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(1)
```

This print statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, or `k`.

Output: **1**
