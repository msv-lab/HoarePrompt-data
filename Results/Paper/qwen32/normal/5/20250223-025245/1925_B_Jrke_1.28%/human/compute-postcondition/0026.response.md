Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `i` is either the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 2 if `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, then `l` contains `ans` and `x // i`; otherwise, `l` contains only `ans`.**
