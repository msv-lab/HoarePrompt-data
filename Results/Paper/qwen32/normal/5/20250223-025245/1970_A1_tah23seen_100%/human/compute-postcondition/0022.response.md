Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character at index `i` of `s`; `d` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `i` and `j` are the first tuple in `d`.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `ans` has been updated to contain the character at index `i` of the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged, including the string `s`, its length `n`, the list of tuples `d`, and the indices `i` and `j`.
