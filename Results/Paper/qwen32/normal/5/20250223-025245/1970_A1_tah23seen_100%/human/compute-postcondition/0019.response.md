The code snippet removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Given that the initial state specifies that `d` has a key `n` with a value of `0`, executing `d.pop(n)` will remove this key-value pair from `d`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. The string `s`, its length `n`, and the empty string `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n-1`.**
