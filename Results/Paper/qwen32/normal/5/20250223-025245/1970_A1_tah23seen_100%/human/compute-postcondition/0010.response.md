The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `s`. If `i` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`, and `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the keys `0` and `1`, and the value for key `0` is `0`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is `(`, then the value for key `1` in `d` is `1`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is `)`, then the value for key `1` in `d` is `-1`. `i` is `1`.**
