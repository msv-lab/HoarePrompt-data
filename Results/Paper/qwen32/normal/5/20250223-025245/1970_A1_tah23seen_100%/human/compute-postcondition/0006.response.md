The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `i + 1` and the value is `d[i] + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `d[i]` (which is `d[0]`) is 0. Therefore, `d[i + 1]` becomes `d[1]` and its value becomes `d[0] + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

The values of `s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The current character at position `i` in `s` is still `(`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the keys `0` and `1`, and values `0` and `1`, respectively; `i` is 0 and the current character at position `i` in `s` is `(`.**
