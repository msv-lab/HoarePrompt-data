The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given that `ans` initially contains the character at index `i` of `s` repeated twice, after this operation, `ans` will contain the character at index `i` of `s` repeated three times.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character at index `i` of `s` repeated three times; `d` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples; `i` and `j` are the third tuple in `d`.**
