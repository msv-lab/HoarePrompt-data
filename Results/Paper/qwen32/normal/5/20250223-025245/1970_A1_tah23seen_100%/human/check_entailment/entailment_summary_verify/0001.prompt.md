You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string formed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on their depth in the nested structure of parentheses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes a single line of input `n` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `d` and sets `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and calculates the prefix balance for each position `i + 1` based on whether the character at `s[i]` is `(` or `)`.
     - If `s[i] == '('`, the balance increases by 1.
     - If `s[i] == ')'`, the balance decreases by 1.
   - After the loop, it removes the last entry `d.pop(n)` which is unnecessary as it simply removes the balance after the last character, which is not used in the sorting or output.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted based on the balance (`x[1]`) in increasing order. In case of ties (same balance), it sorts by the position (`-x[0]`) in decreasing order.
   - This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Reconstructing the Shuffled Sequence**:
   - It initializes an empty string `ans`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of tuples and appends the character `s[i]` to `ans` for each tuple `(i, j)`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` returns the shuffled sequence `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

- The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position.
- It sorts the characters based on the prefix balance and position as specified.
- The sorted characters are then used to form the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
