Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` which is formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the tuples in `d`.**
