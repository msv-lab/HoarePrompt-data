Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. Specifically, the beauty is calculated as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. The optimal strategy is to arrange the array in such a way that the largest elements are as far as possible from the smallest elements. One effective way to achieve this is by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements to maximize the difference.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It sorts the array in ascending order.
4. It then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, moving towards the center of the array.

Let's break down the key part of the program:
```python
a.sort()
kq = 0
for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
    kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
```

- `a.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order.
- `kq` is initialized to 0.
- The loop runs from `0` to `len(a) // 2`, which means it pairs the smallest and largest elements, the second smallest and second largest, and so on.
- In each iteration, it adds the difference between the current largest and smallest elements to `kq`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `3 2 1 3`
- After sorting: `[1, 2, 3]`
- The loop runs for `i = 0`:
  - `kq = 0 + (a[2] - a[0]) = 0 + (3 - 1) = 2`
- The beauty is `2`, which matches the expected output.

For other test cases, the program should also produce the correct results following the same logic.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
