The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `ntest`, and `itest` remain unchanged, while `n` is an input integer that is not directly used in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `ntest` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
