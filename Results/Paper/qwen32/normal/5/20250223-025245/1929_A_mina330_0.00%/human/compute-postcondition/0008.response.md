The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it is iterating over, which is defined by `len(a) // 2`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that the loop iterates from `0` to `len(a) // 2` with a step of `1`, the state of `i` needs to be updated, and no other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`kq` is updated to `kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**
