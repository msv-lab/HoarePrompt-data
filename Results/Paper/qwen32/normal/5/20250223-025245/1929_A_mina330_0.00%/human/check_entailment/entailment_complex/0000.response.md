### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a specific order. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements. This arrangement ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest remaining elements, moving towards the center of the array. This approach is correct because:

- Sorting the array allows us to easily access the largest and smallest elements.
- By iterating from the start and end towards the center and summing the differences, we are effectively maximizing the beauty as described.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - Output: `0`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Beauty: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 80) = 57`
   - Output: `57`

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

All the test cases match the expected output, confirming that the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
