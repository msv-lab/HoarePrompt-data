### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is rearranged. To maximize this beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
2. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Beauty Calculation**: The program calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This is done by iterating through the first half of the sorted array and for each element at index `i`, adding the difference `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` to the result `kq`.
4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the calculated beauty.

The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the beauty of the array. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected.
