The value of `kq` is reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a sorted list of integers; `kq` is 0; `itest` is `itest + 1`; `ntest` remains the same; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `kq` is 0; `itest` is `itest + 1`; `ntest` remains the same; `n` is an input integer.**
