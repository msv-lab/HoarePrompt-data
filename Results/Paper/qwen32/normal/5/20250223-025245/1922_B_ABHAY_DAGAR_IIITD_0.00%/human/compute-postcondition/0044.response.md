The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common convention in Python for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. However, the loop runs for `test_cases` iterations. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the `test_cases` variable.

Given that the loop has just finished an iteration, `test_cases` would have been decremented by 1 (or the loop counter would have been incremented by 1, depending on how you view it). Since the loop runs for `test_cases` iterations, at the start of the next iteration, `test_cases` should be one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less by 1 from the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of all contributions from each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()`**

To be more precise, if `test_cases` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k-1` at the start of the next iteration, provided `k-1` is still greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of all contributions from each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()`**

Since we need to adhere strictly to the format and the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head does not include `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, or `total_count`, the only thing we adjust is `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration**
