Postcondition: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 2 elements. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `x` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already a key; otherwise, `x` is added with a value of 1. `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` and is incremented by 1. `total_count` is incremented by 1. `results` contains `res` as its last element, which is incremented by 1. `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
