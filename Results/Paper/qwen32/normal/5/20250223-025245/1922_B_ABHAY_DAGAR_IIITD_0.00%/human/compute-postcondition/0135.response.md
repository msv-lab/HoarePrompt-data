The only variable in the loop head is `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements. The loop variable `result` has already taken the value of the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 3 elements in the `results` list. The loop variable `result` will then take the value of the third element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements**
