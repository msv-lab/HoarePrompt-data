The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `num_list`. The initial state of `test_cases` and `results` remains unchanged, and `n` is still an input integer.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
