The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. This will affect the `num_of_lens` dictionary directly. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `res`, `total_count`, and `results`) remain unchanged unless their values are directly dependent on the changes in `num_of_lens`.

Since the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()` (`total_count`) will also increase by 1. However, the specific value of `res` depends on the conditions used to calculate it from `num_of_lens.values()`, and without those conditions, we cannot determine the exact new value of `res`. Therefore, we can only state that `total_count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary and contains `x` as a key with its value incremented by 1, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is incremented by 1, `results` contains `res` as its last element.**
