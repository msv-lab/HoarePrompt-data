The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components into an integer, and then stores these integers in a list called `num_list`. The values of `test_cases` and `n` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
