The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The value of `test_cases` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `test_cases` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer.**
