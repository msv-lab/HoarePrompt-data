The code updates the value of the variable `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is 0, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
