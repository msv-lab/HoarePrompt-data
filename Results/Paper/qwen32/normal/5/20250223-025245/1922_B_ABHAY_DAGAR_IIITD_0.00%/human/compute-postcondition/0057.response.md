Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. If `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, a new entry `{x: 1}` is added to the dictionary. `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the last processed element.**
