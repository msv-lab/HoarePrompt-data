The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `total_count` to 0. This action does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`). The only change is the introduction of `total_count` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`test_cases` will be 0 if the loop was executed `test_cases` times initially; `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer; `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it; `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list`; `res` is 0; `total_count` is 0.**
