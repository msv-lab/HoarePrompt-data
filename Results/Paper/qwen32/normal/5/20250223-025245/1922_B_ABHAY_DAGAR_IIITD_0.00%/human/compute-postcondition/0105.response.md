To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the given states step by step.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in `num_list`. For each element, it updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary to count occurrences of each integer in `num_list`. The `total_count` variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration. The `res` variable is updated based on the conditions provided, but since the exact conditions for updating `res` are not specified in the given information, we will assume it simply increments by 1 for each unique element encountered and remains unchanged for repeated elements. The `results` list is updated to include the current value of `res` after each iteration.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration, `num_of_lens` contains one key-value pair where the key is the first element of `num_list` and the value is 1.
- After the second iteration, `num_of_lens` contains two key-value pairs if the second element is different from the first, or the value of the existing key is incremented by 1 if the second element is the same as the first.
- After the third iteration, `num_of_lens` contains three key-value pairs if the third element is different from the first two, or the value of the existing key(s) is incremented by 1 if the third element is the same as one or both of the first two.

After all iterations, the loop will have processed all elements in `num_list`. Therefore, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain all unique elements from `num_list` as keys, with their respective counts as values. The `total_count` will be equal to the length of `num_list` because it is incremented by 1 for each element. The `res` variable will be the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, and `results` will contain `res` as its last element.

Let's assume `num_list` has `n` elements, and `num_of_lens` will have `k` unique keys after all iterations, where `k` is the number of unique elements in `num_list`.

**Output State:**
- `test_cases` is 1 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input (unchanged).
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element in `num_list` is a key, and the value is the count of that element in `num_list`.
- `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions.
- `total_count` is equal to the length of `num_list` (i.e., `n`).
- `results` contains `res` as its last element.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `num_list` and values as their respective counts, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is equal to the length of `num_list`, and `results` contains `res` as its last element.**
