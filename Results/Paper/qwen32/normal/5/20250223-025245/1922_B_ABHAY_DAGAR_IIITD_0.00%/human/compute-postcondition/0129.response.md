The code snippet `results.append(res)` appends the current value of `res` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list will now have one more element, which is the value of `res`.

Given the initial state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count` remain unchanged. Only `results` is updated to include the new element `res`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element in `num_list` is a key, and the value is the count of that element in `num_list`, `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations of elements based on their counts, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `results` contains the final `res` as its last element, with `res` appended to it.**
