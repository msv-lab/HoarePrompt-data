Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `x` is the third element in `num_list`. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, the value associated with the key `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the key `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**
