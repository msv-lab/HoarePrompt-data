Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` contains `res` as its last element.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1. `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not in `num_of_lens`, and `results` contains `res` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is added with a value of 1. `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` and is incremented by 1. `total_count` is incremented by 1. `results` contains `res` as its last element, which is incremented by 1. `x` is the next element in `num_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 2 elements. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `x` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already a key; otherwise, `x` is added with a value of 1. `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` and is incremented by 1. `total_count` is incremented by 1. `results` contains `res` as its last element, which is incremented by 1. `x` is the next element in `num_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
