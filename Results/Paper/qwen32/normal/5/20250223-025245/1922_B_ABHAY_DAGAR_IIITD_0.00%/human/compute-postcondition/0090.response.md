The provided code snippet only contains the line `num_of_lens = {}`, which reinitializes the `num_of_lens` dictionary to an empty dictionary. This action does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `res`, `total_count`, or `results`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` contains `res` as its last element.**
