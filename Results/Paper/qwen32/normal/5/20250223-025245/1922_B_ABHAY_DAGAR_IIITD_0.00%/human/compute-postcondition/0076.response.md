The code snippet updates the value of `res` based on the current value of `cnt` and `total_count`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt` (where `cnt` was the value from the previous iteration), `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
