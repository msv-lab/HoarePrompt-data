Output State: **`results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

This means that the loop has iterated over every element in the `results` list, printing each one, and the loop has terminated because there are no more elements to iterate over in `results`. The state of `results` remains unchanged, but each element within it has been printed to the console.
