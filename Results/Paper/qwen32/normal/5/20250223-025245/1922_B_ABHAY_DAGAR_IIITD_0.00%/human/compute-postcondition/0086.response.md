Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `num_list` remains unchanged, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` contains `res` as its last element.**

In natural language: The value of `res` has been appended to the list `results`, while all other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count`) remain unchanged.
