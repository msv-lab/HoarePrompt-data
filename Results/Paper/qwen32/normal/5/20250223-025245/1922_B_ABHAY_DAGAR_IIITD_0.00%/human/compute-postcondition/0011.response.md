The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the last element of `num_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least one more element after the current `x`. Since the loop iterates over `num_list`, the next value of `x` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. If `x` is a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with the value `1`, `x` is the second element in `num_list`**
