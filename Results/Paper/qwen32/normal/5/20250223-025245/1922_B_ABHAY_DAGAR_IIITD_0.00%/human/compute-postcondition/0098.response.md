The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the count of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. If `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1. If `x` was not already a key in `num_of_lens`, this line would raise a `KeyError`. However, based on the initial state, we can assume that `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens` since `total_count` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`.

Given this, the count associated with `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, and `res`, which is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, is also increased by 1 because `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()`. The last element of `results` is `res`, so `results` will also reflect this change.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key and its value is incremented by 1, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` and is incremented by 1, `total_count` is incremented by 1, and `results` contains `res` as its last element, which is incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
