To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, we need to analyze the conditions and values of the variables provided in the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. This variable represents the number of test cases but is not directly relevant to the print statement.
2. `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. This variable represents the length of the list `a`.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99. This list is given as input.
4. `m` is an input integer. The exact role of `m` is not specified in the initial state, but it might be used in the loop logic.
5. `arr` is a list of integers that may have been updated based on the loop's logic. The exact state of `arr` is not provided, but it is implied that it is derived from `a` in some way.
6. `ans` is a boolean that is `True` unless the loop found a pair `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` such that the concatenated list `nums` was not sorted, in which case `ans` is `False`. This boolean indicates whether the list `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

This statement uses a list `['NO', 'YES']` and indexes into it using the boolean value of `ans`. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used as indices.

- If `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, which is `'YES'`.
- If `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, which is `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement depends on the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is `True` if `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order and `False` otherwise, the print statement will output `'YES'` if `arr` is sorted and `'NO'` if it is not sorted.

Output: **'YES' if `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise 'NO'**
