Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[i - 1]` updated to `nums[0]`; `i` is `i - 1`; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
