Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
