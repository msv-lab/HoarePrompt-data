The code snippet provided creates a new list `nums` by taking the digits of the integer at the position `i-1` in the list `arr` and appending the integer at the position `i` in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.
- `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99.
- `i` is decreased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

After executing the code snippet:
- `nums` is a new list that contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.

No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `i` is decreased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.**
