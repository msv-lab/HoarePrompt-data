Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `i` is 2. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, `arr` remains unchanged and the state of `ans` remains unchanged.**
