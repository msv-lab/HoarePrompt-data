Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then the integer at index `i - 1` is now `nums[0]` and `arr[i]` is less than the integer at index `i - 1` before the update, with `nums` being a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` before the update followed by `arr[i]`; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
