The code snippet provided updates the `nums` list by converting the integer at `arr[i - 1]` into its individual digits and appending the integer at `arr[i]` to the end of this list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers with specific conditions for `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`
- `ans` remains unchanged unless previously set to `False`
- `i` is 1

The code snippet:
```
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```

This code will create a new list `nums` that consists of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then the integer at index `i - 1` is now `nums[0]` and `arr[i]` is less than the integer at index `i - 1` before the update, with `nums` being a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` before the update followed by `arr[i]`; `ans` remains unchanged unless previously set to `False`; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**
