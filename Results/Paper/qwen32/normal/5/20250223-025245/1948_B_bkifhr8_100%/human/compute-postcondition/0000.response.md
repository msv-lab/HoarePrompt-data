The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will change based on the input provided, but the precondition for `n` (that it is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50) must still hold after the input is taken.

The other variables `t` and `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.**
