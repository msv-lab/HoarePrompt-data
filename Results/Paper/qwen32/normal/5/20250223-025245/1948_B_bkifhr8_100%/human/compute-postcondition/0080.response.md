The code snippet updates the `nums` list by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (converted to a list of integers) with `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99
- `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `i - 1`
- `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`
- If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

The code updates `nums` to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i - 1`; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, specifically `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`.**
