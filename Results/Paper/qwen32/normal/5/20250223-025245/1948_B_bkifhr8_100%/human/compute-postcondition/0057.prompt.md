Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `ans` is a boolean that is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then the integer at index `i - 1` is now `nums[0]` and `arr[i]` is less than the integer at index `i - 1` before the update, with `nums` being a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` before the update followed by `arr[i]`. `ans` remains unchanged unless previously set to `False`. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr` and other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[0]` is updated to `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, with `nums` being a list consisting of the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged; `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `i` is 2. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, `arr` remains unchanged and the state of `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
