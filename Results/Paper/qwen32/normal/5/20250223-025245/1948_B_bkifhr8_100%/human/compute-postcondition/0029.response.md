To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the value of the variable `ans`. The variable `ans` is a boolean that is set to `False` if any `nums` (which is not mentioned in the initial state, but presumably refers to a list or array that is checked for being sorted) was not sorted during the loop. If all `nums` were sorted, `ans` remains `True`.

The print statement `print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])` uses a list indexing trick. The list `['NO', 'YES']` is indexed by the boolean value of `ans`. In Python, `False` is equivalent to `0` and `True` is equivalent to `1`. Therefore:

- If `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, which is `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, which is `'YES'`.

Thus, the output depends on the value of `ans`:
- If `ans` is `False`, the output is `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the output is `'YES'`.

Since the exact value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine with certainty whether the output will be `'NO'` or `'YES'`. However, we can describe the output based on the value of `ans`.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where 'NO' is printed if ans is False and 'YES' is printed if ans is True)**
