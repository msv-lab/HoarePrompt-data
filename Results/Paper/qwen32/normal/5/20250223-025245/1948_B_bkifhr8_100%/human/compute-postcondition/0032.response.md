The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components into integers, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Given this, the Output State will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `ans` is a boolean that is `False` if any `nums` was not sorted during the loop, otherwise `True`.**

In simpler terms, `arr` has been updated to contain the integers from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
