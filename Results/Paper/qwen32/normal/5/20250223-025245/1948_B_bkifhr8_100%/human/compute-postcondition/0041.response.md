The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `nums`, and `ans`) remain unchanged unless `nums` was not sorted, in which case `ans` would have been set to `False` and the loop or if statement would have been broken. However, since the code snippet provided does not include the condition that checks the sorted status of `nums`, we assume that the update to `arr[i - 1]` is the only change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where the integer at index `i - 1` is now `nums[0]` and each integer at index `i` is less than the integer at index `i - 1` before the update; `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` before the update followed by `arr[i]`; `ans` remains unchanged unless previously set to `False`.**
