Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `ans` is a boolean that is `True`.**

The value of `ans` has been updated to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
