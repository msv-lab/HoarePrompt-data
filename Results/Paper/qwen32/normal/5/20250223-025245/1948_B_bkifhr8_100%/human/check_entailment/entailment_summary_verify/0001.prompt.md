You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by repeatedly replacing a pair of adjacent elements where the first is greater than the second, with a new element formed by concatenating the digits of the first element and the second element, followed by sorting the resulting digits. It prints 'YES' if such a transformation is possible for the list, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of integers.
- We can split any element `a_i` that is at least 10 into its digits and insert them in the same position.
- The goal is to determine if we can sort the array in non-decreasing order using the above operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning. For each pair of adjacent elements, if the latter is smaller than the former, it tries to split the larger element and checks if the resulting array (after the split and insertion) is sorted.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion Logic**: The program attempts to split `arr[i-1]` when `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`. However, it only checks if the array `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i-1])] + [arr[i]]` is sorted, which is not a valid operation since it's only checking a partial sequence and not the entire array after the split.

2. **Incomplete Splitting**: The program only splits `arr[i-1]` and checks a small part of the array, but it doesn't actually perform the split in the array or continue checking the rest of the array.

3. **No Proper Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program does not handle the case where multiple splits might be necessary to achieve a sorted array. It only checks one possible split at a time.

4. **Incorrect Assumption**: The program assumes that if a single split can make a small part of the array sorted, then the entire array can be sorted, which is not necessarily true.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
- Iterate through the array and identify elements that are at least 10.
- Split these elements into their digits and insert them back into the array.
- Continuously check if the array is sorted after each possible split.
- If the array becomes sorted after a series of splits, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
