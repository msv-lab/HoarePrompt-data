The code snippet provided updates the `nums` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual string values, converting each of these to an integer, and then storing them in a list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts.**

In simpler terms, the `nums` list has been updated to contain the integers from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
