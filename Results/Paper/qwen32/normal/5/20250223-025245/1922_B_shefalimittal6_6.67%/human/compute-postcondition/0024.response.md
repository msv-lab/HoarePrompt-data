The code snippet calculates the `total_sum` by summing the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary where the value is not equal to `cnt`. This affects the `total_sum` variable. The other variables are not directly modified by this snippet.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is equal to 2, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.**

In natural language, the `total_sum` has been updated to be the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
