Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens` that has not been iterated over; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to it if `cnt` is 3 or greater. All other variables retain their previous values.
