The code calculates the `total_sum` by summing the values in `num_of_lens` that are not equal to `cnt`. Given the initial state, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}` and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `2`. Since the only value in `num_of_lens` is `1` and it is not equal to `cnt` (which is greater than or equal to `2`), `total_sum` will be `1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`, `cnt` is greater than or equal to `2`, `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `3`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged, `total_sum` is `1`**.
