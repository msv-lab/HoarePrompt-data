To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to consider the provided initial state and the behavior of the loop. The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates a result `res` based on the counts of each unique integer in the list.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **First Iteration**: The loop processes the first test case.
2. **Second Iteration**: The loop processes the second test case.
3. **Third Iteration**: The loop processes the third test case, where `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`, and `res` is `0`.

Since `t` is 0 after the third iteration, it implies that there are no more test cases to process. Therefore, the loop will terminate after the third iteration.

The final output state will be the accumulated result from all processed test cases. Since the third iteration does not contribute to the result (`res` is `0`), the final result will be the sum of results from the first two iterations.

However, the problem statement does not provide the specific results from the first two iterations. Therefore, we can only conclude that the loop will terminate after processing the given test cases.

Output State: **The loop has terminated after processing all test cases. The final result `res` is the sum of results from all processed test cases.**

In natural language: The loop has finished executing all the test cases specified by `t`. The final output `res` is the accumulated result from all the processed test cases. Since the specific results from the first two iterations are not provided, we cannot give a numerical value for `res`, but we know that it is the sum of results from all iterations.
