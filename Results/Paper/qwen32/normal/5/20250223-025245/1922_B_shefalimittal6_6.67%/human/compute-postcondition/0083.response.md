The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments the variable `res` by the value of the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, which is calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Given that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` can be calculated directly. However, without the exact value of `cnt`, we express the new value of `res` as `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

Output State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`, `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `3`.**
