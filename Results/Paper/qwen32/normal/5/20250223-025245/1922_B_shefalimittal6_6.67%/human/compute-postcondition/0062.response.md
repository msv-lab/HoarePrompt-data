The given code snippet is:
```python
res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
```

This line of code calculates the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time using `math.comb(cnt, 3)` and adds the result to `res`.

Here's the updated Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is updated based on the previous `cnt` value if `cnt` was greater than or equal to 2, and now `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that has not been iterated over; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the new `cnt`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `res` has been updated by adding the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time to it.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `total_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
