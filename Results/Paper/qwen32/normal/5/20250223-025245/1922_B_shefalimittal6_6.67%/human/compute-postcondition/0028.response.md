The code snippet provided calculates the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time and adds this value to `res`. The value of `res` is updated, but the values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**.
