The code calculates the sum of all the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary except for the value that is equal to `cnt`. This sum is stored in the variable `total_sum`.

Given that:
- `t` is an integer representing the length of `nums`.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` is updated based on the combination of counts in `num_of_lens`.
- `cnt` is a count value greater than or equal to 2.

The only variable affected by the code is `total_sum`, which is calculated as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**
