The code snippet provided is:

```python
num_of_lens = {}
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `num_of_lens` to an empty dictionary, discarding its previous value (which was a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts.**
