The given code snippet updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of the key `x` by 1. If `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a value of 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, or set to 1 if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one integer; `x` is the next element in `nums`.**
