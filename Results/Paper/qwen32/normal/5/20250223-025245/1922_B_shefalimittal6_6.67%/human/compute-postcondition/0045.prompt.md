Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts.
Code of the loop:
for x in nums:
    num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an updated dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an updated dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts; `x` is `nums[t]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t + 1` such that 0 ≤ `t + 1` < length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an updated dictionary where the count of `nums[t + 1]` is incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts; `x` is `nums[t + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
