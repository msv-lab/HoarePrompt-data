The code snippet `num_of_lens = {}` reassigns `num_of_lens` to an empty dictionary. This means the previous dictionary contents are discarded, and `num_of_lens` is now an empty dictionary. Other variables such as `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `len(nums) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is {}, `nums` remains the input list, and `res` is updated to the accumulated sum based on the counts in `num_of_lens`**.
