The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. To execute one more time, `cnt` must be set to the next value in the dictionary.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` held a specific value from `num_of_lens.values()`. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` should be set to the next value in the iteration sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

Since the problem does not provide the current value of `cnt` or the specific values in `num_of_lens`, we can only generalize that `cnt` needs to be the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; if `cnt` is equal to 2, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.**
