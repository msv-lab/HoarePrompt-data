Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 0
- `n` is an input integer (value not specified, but it is not used in the given print statement)
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary `{5: 1}`
- `nums` is a list `[5]`
- `res` is 0

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(res)` statement will output the value of the variable `res`. According to the initial state, `res` is explicitly defined as 0.

### Output:
Based on the given information, the `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
