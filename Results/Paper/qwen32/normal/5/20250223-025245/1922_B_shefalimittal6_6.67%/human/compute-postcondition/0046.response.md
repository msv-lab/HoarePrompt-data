The code snippet provided sets `res` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `res` regardless of what it was. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the counts of each unique integer in `nums` incremented by 1 for each occurrence; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is 0.**
