The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of these string values to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` retain their initial values, and `num_of_lens` remains an empty dictionary. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
