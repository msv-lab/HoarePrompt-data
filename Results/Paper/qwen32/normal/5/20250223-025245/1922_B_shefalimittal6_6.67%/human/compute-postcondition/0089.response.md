The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `num_of_lens` and adjust `cnt` accordingly.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `0`
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`
- `nums` is `[5]`
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `2`, `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` is `1`. Otherwise, `res` and `total_sum` remain unchanged.

In this specific case, `num_of_lens` has only one key-value pair `{5: 1}`. Since `cnt` took the value `1` in the previous iteration (the only value in `num_of_lens.values()`), there are no more values for `cnt` to take from `num_of_lens`.

Therefore, the loop will not execute again because there are no more values in `num_of_lens.values()` to iterate over. However, if we were to hypothetically add another value to `num_of_lens` for the loop to continue, we would adjust `num_of_lens` and `cnt` accordingly.

For the sake of answering the question as instructed, we'll assume that `num_of_lens` could potentially have more values in a different scenario. If `num_of_lens` had another value, `cnt` would take that value in the next iteration.

Since the current `num_of_lens` only has one value and the loop has already iterated over it, the loop cannot execute again with the given state. However, if we were to add another value to `num_of_lens` for demonstration, let's say `num_of_lens` becomes `{5: 1, 3: 3}` after some external modification, then `cnt` would take the next value `3` in the next iteration.

Hypothetical State Adjustment (for demonstration):
- `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1, 3: 3}`
- `cnt` would be `3` in the next iteration.

State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1, 3: 3}`, `nums` is `[5]`, `cnt` is `3`**

But since the actual `num_of_lens` only has one value and the loop has already completed with the given state, the loop will not execute again. The correct state reflecting no further iterations is:

State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`**
