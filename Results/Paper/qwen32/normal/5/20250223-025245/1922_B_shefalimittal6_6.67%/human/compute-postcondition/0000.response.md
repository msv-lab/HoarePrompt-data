Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is assigned the value of the input integer.**

In simple terms, `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, and all other conditions and variables remain as specified in the initial state.
