To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the provided line of code on the existing variables. The code snippet is:

```python
res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
```

The variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `total_sum` are provided in the initial state, but `res` and `cnt` are not. Let's assume `res` is a variable that exists and could hold any value, and `cnt` is a variable that also exists and could hold any value. However, since `total_sum` depends on `cnt`, we need to consider the possible values of `cnt` to determine how `total_sum` will affect the calculation.

Given:
- `total_sum` is `1` if `cnt` is `0`, `2`, or `>= 3`
- `total_sum` is `0` if `cnt` is `1`

Let's consider the possible values of `cnt` and how they affect the calculation:

1. If `cnt` is `0`:
   - `math.comb(0, 2)` is `0` (since you can't choose 2 items from 0 items)
   - `res += 0 * 1` => `res` remains unchanged

2. If `cnt` is `1`:
   - `math.comb(1, 2)` is `0` (since you can't choose 2 items from 1 item)
   - `res += 0 * 0` => `res` remains unchanged

3. If `cnt` is `2`:
   - `math.comb(2, 2)` is `1` (since there is exactly one way to choose 2 items from 2 items)
   - `res += 1 * 1` => `res` is incremented by `1`

4. If `cnt` is `>= 3`:
   - `math.comb(cnt, 2)` is a positive integer (the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items)
   - `res += positive_integer * 1` => `res` is incremented by `positive_integer`

Since the exact value of `cnt` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `res`. However, we can describe the change to `res` based on the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`, `total_sum` is `1` if `cnt` is `0`, `2`, or `>= 3`, and `total_sum` is `0` if `cnt` is `1`; `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**
