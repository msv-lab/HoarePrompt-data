Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
