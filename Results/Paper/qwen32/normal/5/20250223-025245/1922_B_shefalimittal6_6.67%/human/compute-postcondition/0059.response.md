Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens` that has not been iterated over; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is updated by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. All other variables remain unchanged or maintain their previous state and relationships.
