The code snippet provided is `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This means that the current value of `res` is being incremented by the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

Given the initial state, `res` is already calculated based on the conditions involving `cnt` and `total_sum`. The new value of `res` will be the previous value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 3)`; if `cnt` is equal to 2, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.**

In simpler terms, if `cnt` is 3 or greater, `res` is now `math.comb(cnt, 3) * 2 + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0.
