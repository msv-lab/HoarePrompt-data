The provided code calculates the sum of all values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary except for the value stored in `cnt`. This sum is then assigned to the variable `total_sum`. The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `res` are not directly modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`.**
