Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly account for all possible combinations of sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, it does not properly handle cases where three different lengths of sticks can form a triangle. The current implementation only considers combinations where at least two sticks have the same length and the third one is different, but it misses cases where all three sticks have different lengths.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check all combinations of three sticks and verify if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem (the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lengths = [2 ** a for a in nums]
        res = 0
        for a, b, c in combinations(lengths, 3):
            if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
                res += 1
        print(res)

func()
```

This version uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three stick lengths and checks if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. However, this approach may not be efficient enough for the upper constraints (since it checks all combinations, which is O(n^3)), so further optimizations would be necessary for large inputs.
