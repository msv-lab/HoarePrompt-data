The code snippet sets `h1` to an empty string and keeps `m1` unchanged. The value of `m1` remains the string representation of the minute part of `s`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `time`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `h1` is an empty string, `time` is `'AM'` if `h` is from `'01'` to `'12'` or `'PM'` if `h` is from `'13'` to `'23'` or `'PM'` if `h` is `'00'`, and `h1` and `time` remain empty strings if `h` does not match any specified values.**
