Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `h1` is `'12'`, `time` is `'PM'`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440, `s` remains a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` and `m` retain their previous values representing the hour and minute parts of `s`, `m1` retains the value of the minute part of `s`, `h1` remains `'12'`, and `time` is now set to `'PM'`.
