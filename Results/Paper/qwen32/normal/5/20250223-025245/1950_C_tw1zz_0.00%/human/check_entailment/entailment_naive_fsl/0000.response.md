Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the conversion of 24-hour format to 12-hour format correctly for all cases. Specifically, there is a logical error in handling the hour `00` and `12`.

- For the hour `00`, it should be converted to `12 AM`, but the code incorrectly converts it to `12 PM`.
- The hour `12` should remain `12 PM`, but the code incorrectly converts it to `12 AM`.

Here is an example of the incorrect output:
- Input: `00:59`
- Expected Output: `12:59 AM`
- Actual Output: `12:59 PM`

- Input: `12:00`
- Expected Output: `12:00 PM`
- Actual Output: `12:00 AM`

To fix the code, the conditions for handling `00` and `12` should be adjusted:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h = int(h)
        m1 = m
        time = ''
        if h == 0:
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h < 12:
            h1 = f"{h:02d}"
            time = 'AM'
        else:
            h1 = f"{h - 12:02d}"
            time = 'PM'
        print(h1, ':', m1, ' ', time, sep='')
```

This revised code correctly handles the conversion for all edge cases.
