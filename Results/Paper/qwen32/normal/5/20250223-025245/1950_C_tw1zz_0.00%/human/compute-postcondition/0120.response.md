Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s`, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `h1` and `time` are updated based on the value of `h`. If `h` is '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '10' to '12', then `h1` is the string representation of `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', then `h1` is the string representation of `h` converted to 12-hour format with leading zeros removed, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. For all other values of `h` (i.e., '01' to '02'), `h1` and `time` remain unchanged from their initial state.**
