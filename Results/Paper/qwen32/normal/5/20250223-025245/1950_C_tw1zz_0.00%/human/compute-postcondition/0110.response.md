Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s`, and `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is '13', then `h1` is '01', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '14', then `h1` is '02', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '15', then `h1` is '03', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '16', then `h1` is '04', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '17', then `h1` is '05', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '18', then `h1` is '06', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. For all other values of `h` (i.e., '01' to '12'), `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
