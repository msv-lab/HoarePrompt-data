The code snippet splits the input string `s` by the colon `:` and maps each part to a string, assigning them to `h` and `m`. Given that `s` is a string in the format "hh:mm", `h` will be the string representation of the hour part ("hh") and `m` will be the string representation of the minute part ("mm"). The values of `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s`, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`.**
