Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s`, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is '15', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '16', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '17', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '18', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '19', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '20', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. For all other values of `h`, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string. `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', or '15'.**
