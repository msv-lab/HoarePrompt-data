The code assigns the string `'09'` to the variable `h1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `h1` is `'09'`, `time` is an empty string.**
