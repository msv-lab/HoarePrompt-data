Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, there is a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s`, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02' to '12', then `h1` is the string representation of `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', then `h1` is the string representation of `h` converted to 12-hour format with leading zeros removed, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. For all other values of `h`, `h1` and `time` remain unchanged from their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is `'01'`, then `h1` is `'01'` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is `'02'`, then `h1` is `'02'` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is `'03'`, then `h1` is `'03'` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is `'04'`, then `h1` is `'04'` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is `'05'`, then `h1` is `'05'` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is any value from `'06'` to `'12'`, then `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is any value from `'13'` to `'23'`, then `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format with `'PM'` as `time`. If `h` is `'00'`, then `h1` is `'12'` and `time` is `'PM'`. If `h` does not match any of the specified values, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04' to '11', then `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', then `h1` is '01' to '11' respectively and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` does not match any of these values, `h1` and `time` remain as empty strings.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
