Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `right` is 1. If `s[right]` is '0', then `trightZero` is 0 and `tleftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `trightZero` is 1, `trightOne` is -1, and `tleftOne` is 1.**
