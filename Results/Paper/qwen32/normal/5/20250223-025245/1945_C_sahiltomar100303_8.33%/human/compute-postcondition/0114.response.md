Based on the initial state provided, we can determine the value of the variable `right` that will be printed.

From the initial state:
- `n` is set to 2.
- `right` is set to 2.
- Additionally, `right` is described as being equal to `n`.

Since `right` is explicitly set to 2 and there are no operations or conditions that change its value before the print statement, `right` remains 2.

Therefore, the `print(right)` statement will output the value of `right`.

Output: **2**
