The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state, `left` is 1, so after the operation, `left` becomes 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly dependent on `left`. Since `left` is now 0, we need to re-evaluate the conditions involving `left`.

- `leftZero` and `leftOne` are dependent on the value of `s[left - 1]`. Since `left` is now 0, we need to check `s[0 - 1]`, which is `s[-1]`. Given the initial state, `s` is "00", so `s[-1]` is '0'.
- If `s[-1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is set to 3 and `leftZero` is set to -1. However, since `left` is now 0, `leftZero` is recalculated based on the new position of `left`. Since `left` is 0, `s[left - 1]` is not applicable directly, but we can infer that `leftZero` would be recalculated based on the new position. Given the initial conditions, and since `left` is now 0, `leftZero` remains -1 as per the initial condition when `left` is 1 and `s[left - 1]` is '0'.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is either 2 or 3; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is either 0 or 1; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is -1; `leftOne` is either 0 or -1`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 3 and `leftZero` is -1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is 1 and `leftOne` is -1.**
