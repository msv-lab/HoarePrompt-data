The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `rightZero` was 1, so after the increment, `rightZero` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 0; `i` is 2; `rightZero` is 2; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `left` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0'.**
