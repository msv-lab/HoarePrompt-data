The code snippet provided increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this statement.

Given the initial state, `rightOne` is the count of non-'0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`. After executing `rightOne += 1`, the value of `rightOne` will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`; `leftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1; `rightOne` is the count of non-'0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1` plus 1; `tleftZero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`; `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of non-'0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`; `left` is `mid`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops; the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0'**.
