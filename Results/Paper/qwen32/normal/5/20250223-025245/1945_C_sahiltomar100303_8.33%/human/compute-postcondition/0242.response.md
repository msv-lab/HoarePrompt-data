To determine the output of the `print(left)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `mid` is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - Several variables (`leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, `right`) are defined with specific conditions and calculations.

2. **Specific Variable Focus**:
   - `left` is explicitly stated to be `0` in the initial state.

3. **The Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(left)` is given, and we need to determine the value of `left`.

Given that `left` is explicitly stated to be `0` in the initial state and there is no information provided that modifies the value of `left` before the `print` statement, we can confidently say that `left` retains its initial value.

Therefore, the output of the `print(left)` statement will be the value of `left`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
