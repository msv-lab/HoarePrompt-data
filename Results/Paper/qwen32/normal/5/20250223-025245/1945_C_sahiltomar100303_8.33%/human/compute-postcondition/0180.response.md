Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is incremented by `3` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `3`; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is `3` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `2`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is incremented by `1` if `s[i]` is '0'; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is incremented by `1` if `s[i]` is not '0'; `i` is `mid + 2`**

Explanation: The only change is that `rightZero` is incremented by 1, making its new value `rightZero + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
