Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is `0`; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is `1`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is `0`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is `0`; `s[i]` is not '0'**.

In natural language, the variable `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, so its value is now `1`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
