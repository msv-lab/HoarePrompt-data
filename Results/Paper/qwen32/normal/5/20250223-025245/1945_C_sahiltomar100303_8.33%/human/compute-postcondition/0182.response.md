The given code snippet only modifies the value of `rightOne` by incrementing it by 1. Therefore, the value of `rightOne` will be increased by 1 from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is incremented by `2` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise remains `2`; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is `3` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `2`, and now `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is incremented by `1` if `s[i]` is '0'; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is incremented by `1` if `s[i]` is not '0'; `i` is `mid + 2`**.
