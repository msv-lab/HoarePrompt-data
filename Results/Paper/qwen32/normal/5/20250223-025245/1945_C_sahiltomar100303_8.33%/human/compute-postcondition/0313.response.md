Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than `mid`; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `mid + 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `left` is `0`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops. If the character at position `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is `2` and `trightZero` is `3`; otherwise, `rightZero` is `1` and `trightZero` is `0`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is not '0', then `rightOne` is `2` and `trightOne` is `2`; otherwise, `rightOne` is `0` and `trightOne` is `0`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is '0', `trightZero` is increased by 1; otherwise, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are each incremented by 1. `rightOne` is increased by 1; `trightOne` is increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `trightOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
