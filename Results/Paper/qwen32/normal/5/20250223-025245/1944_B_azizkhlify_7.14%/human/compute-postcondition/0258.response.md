The code snippet `res.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 4, the element `a[4]` is appended to `res`.

Output State: **`ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`. `ur` is 0. `re` is `re + 1`. `n` is a positive integer. `k` is a non-zero integer and `k` is `2 * k - ul`. `a` is a list of integers read from input. `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`. `res` is a list containing `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `res` is an empty list, and now `res` includes `a[4]`. If `re` is equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `i` is 4.**
