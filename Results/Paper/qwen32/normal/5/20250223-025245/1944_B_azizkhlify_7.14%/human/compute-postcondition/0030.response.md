Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0.
3. **`k`**: The second integer read from the input.
4. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers read from the input.
5. **`l`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
6. **`r`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`.
7. **`re`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`ul`**: Set to 2 if `ul == k * 2`, otherwise set to 0.
9. **`ur`**: Initialized to 0.
10. **`res`**: An empty list.
11. **`i`**: Set to `n - 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is set to `n - 1`, meaning it points to the last element of the list `a`.
- The print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.

### Output:
Given that `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` refers to the last element of the list `a`. Let's denote this value as `a[n-1]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the last element of the list `a` twice.

Output: **a[n-1] a[n-1]** (where `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list `a`)
