To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ul`**: This variable is set to 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise it remains 0.
2. **`ur`**: This variable is initialized to 0.
3. **`re`**: This variable is initialized to 0.
4. **`n`**: This is a positive integer.
5. **`k`**: This is an input integer.
6. **`a`**: This is a list of integers read from input.
7. **`l`**: This is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`.
8. **`r`**: This is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
9. **`i`**: This variable is initialized to 1.
10. **`res`**: This is an empty list.
11. **Condition**: If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is initialized to 1. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the second element of the list `a` (since list indices in Python are 0-based).

### Output Explanation:
The print statement will output the value of the second element of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
