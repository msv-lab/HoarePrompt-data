To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. **n**: An integer greater than 0.
3. **k**: Defined as `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero.
4. **a**: A list of `n` integers read from the input.
5. **l**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
6. **r**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`. However, since `a` only has `n` elements, this part of the description seems to be incorrect or incomplete.
7. **ul**: Either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations.
8. **ur**: Remains 0.
9. **i**: Incremented by 1 in each iteration.
10. **re**: Adjusted based on the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.
11. **res**: Includes `a[i]` if `re` is incremented. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the execution continues without breaking.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will output the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

- **a[i]**: This is the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- **i**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, so it will point to different elements of the list `a` during different iterations.

### Output:
Given the initial state, the value of `a[i]` will be the element at the current index `i` of the list `a`. Since `i` is incremented in each iteration, the exact value printed will depend on the current iteration and the contents of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
