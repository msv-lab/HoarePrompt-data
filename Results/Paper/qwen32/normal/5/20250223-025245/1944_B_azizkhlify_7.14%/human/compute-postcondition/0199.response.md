To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided conditions and the output states after the first 3 iterations.

### Key Points:
1. The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`.
2. The loop will break if `ul` equals `ur`.
3. Inside the loop, if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `ur` is incremented by 2, and the values of `a[i]` are printed.
4. The output states after the first 3 iterations indicate that `ul` and `ur` may have become equal if the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was met and `ul` was incremented by 2.

### Final Output State Analysis:
- The loop will run a total of `n` iterations (from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`).
- The loop will break as soon as `ul` equals `ur`.
- If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` during any iteration, `ur` is incremented by 2, and `ul` must also be incremented by 2 to break the loop.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `ul` never equals `ur` during the loop:**
   - The loop will run for all `n` iterations.
   - `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
   - `ul` will remain unchanged unless explicitly incremented.

2. **If `ul` equals `ur` during the loop:**
   - The loop will break before completing all `n` iterations.
   - The exact number of iterations will depend on when `ul` equals `ur`.

### Final Output State:
Given that the loop breaks when `ul` equals `ur`, and `ur` is incremented by 2 when `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, the final state will be determined by the point at which `ul` equals `ur`.

**Output State: **The loop will terminate when `ul` equals `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` during any iteration, `ur` (and `ul` if the break condition is met) will be incremented by 2. The exact values of `ul` and `ur` at the end will depend on the specific values of `a[i]` and `r[a[i] - 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The loop will stop as soon as `ul` equals `ur`, and `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. The final values of `ul` and `ur` will be such that they are equal at the point of termination.
