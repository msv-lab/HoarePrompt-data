To determine the output of the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ul` Calculation**:
   - `ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations.
   - Otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`.

2. **`ur` and `re`**:
   - `ur` is initialized to 0.
   - `re` is initialized to 0.

3. **`n` and `k`**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a non-zero integer.
   - `k` is recalculated as `2 * k - ul`.

4. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input.

5. **List `l`**:
   - `l` is a list of `n` integers.
   - Each index `j` in `l` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`.

6. **List `r`**:
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers.
   - Each index `j` in `r` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

7. **List `res`**:
   - `res` is an empty list.

8. **Condition for `l[a[i] - 1]`**:
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1.

### Analysis of `print(a[i], end=' ')`:
- The statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.
- From the precondition, we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, which means the integer `a[i]` appears exactly once in the list `a`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `a[i]` appears exactly once in the list `a` and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, we can deduce that `a[i]` is a unique element in the list `a`.
- However, without the specific values of `a` and `i`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the unique element `a[i]` from the list `a`, followed by a space. Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided in the initial state, we describe it as a unique element in the list `a`.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is a unique element in the list a)**
