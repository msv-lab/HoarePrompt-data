Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations, `ur` remains 0, and `res` remains an empty list. If `k` is non-zero, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed, and `res` contains the elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1, up to `k` elements. If `k` is zero, no further changes occur to `k`, `re`, or `res`.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations, `ur` remains 0, `res` is a list containing at least one element, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` if non-zero, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations, `ur` remains 0, `res` is a list containing at least one element, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` if non-zero, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed, `i` is the next element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations, `ur` remains 0, `res` is a list containing at least one element, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` if non-zero, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed, `i` is the next element in `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
