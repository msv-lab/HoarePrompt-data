To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop progresses and changes the variables based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `k` is initially set to `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero.
   - `a` is the list of `n` integers read from the input.
   - `l` is a list where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
   - `r` is a list where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`.
   - `re` is initialized to 0.
   - `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations.
   - `ur` remains 0.
   - `res` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`:
     - If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, it prints `a[i]`, increments `re` by 1, and appends `a[i]` to `res`.
     - If `re == k`, the loop breaks.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- The loop will iterate `n` times unless it breaks early when `re` equals `k`.
- `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
- `k` remains `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero.
- `re` will be the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed.
- `res` will contain the elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1, up to `k` elements.

### Final Output State:
- If `re` never reaches `k` during the iterations, the loop completes all `n` iterations, and `re` will be the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once.
- If `re` reaches `k` before the loop completes, the loop breaks, and `res` will contain exactly `k` elements.

### Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and is non-zero, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations, `ur` remains 0, `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed, and `res` contains the elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1, up to `k` elements.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop completes all iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains the initial number of integers, `k` remains adjusted as `2 * k - ul`, and `a`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged. The variable `re` holds the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, up to `k` elements. The list `res` contains these unique elements.
