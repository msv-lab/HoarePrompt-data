### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here is a breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the list `a` of 2n integers.

2. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to count the frequency of each integer in the first half and second half of the list `a` respectively. 
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` keeps track of the count of the integer `a[i]` in the first half.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` keeps track of the count of the integer `a[i]` in the second half.

3. **Constructing the Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - The program then constructs the arrays `l` and `r` by iterating through the first and second halves of the list `a` respectively.
   - It iterates over the first `n` elements to populate `l` and the next `n` elements to populate `r`.

4. **Finding Pairs in the First Half (l):**
   - The program attempts to find pairs of integers in the first half of the list `a` that appear exactly twice.
   - If such pairs are found, it prints them and increments `ul` (the count of elements used from the first half).

5. **Finding Unique Elements in the First Half (l):**
   - If the number of pairs found (`ul`) is less than `2k`, the program then looks for unique elements in the first half of the list `a` that appear only once.
   - It prints these unique elements until the total count of elements printed from the first half reaches `2k`.

6. **Printing the Corresponding Elements from the Second Half (r):**
   - The program then prints the same number of elements from the second half of the list `a` to ensure that the XOR condition is met.
   - It starts by printing pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the second half.
   - If necessary, it prints additional unique integers that appear only once to match the number of elements printed from the first half.

7. **Ensuring Correctness:**
   - The program ensures that the total number of elements printed from both halves is `2k`.
   - It also ensures that the XOR condition is met by printing the same number of elements from both halves.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. The program handles the constraints and requirements of the problem effectively.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
