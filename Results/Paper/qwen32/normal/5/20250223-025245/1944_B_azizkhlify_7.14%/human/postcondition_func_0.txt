The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the list `a` based on specific conditions related to the frequency of each integer in the list. The function ensures that it prints `k` pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the list, and if necessary, it prints additional unique integers that appear only once to reach the required count of `k` pairs. The function maintains the input values `t`, `n`, and `a` unchanged and outputs the specified integers for each test case.
