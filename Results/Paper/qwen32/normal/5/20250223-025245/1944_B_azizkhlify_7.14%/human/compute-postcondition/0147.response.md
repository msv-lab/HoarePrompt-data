To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. However, the value of `t` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement in this context.
2. **n**: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. **i**: Initialized to 0.
4. **l[a[i] - 1]**: This indicates that there is a list `l` and an element `a[i]` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `l[a[0] - 1]` being 1.

### Key Variables:
- **a[i]**: Since `i` is 0, we need to determine the value of `a[0]`. The only information we have is that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1. This means that `a[0] - 1` is an index in the list `l` where the value is 1. Therefore, `a[0]` must be an integer such that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```
Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to:
```python
print(a[0], end=' ')
```

### Determining the Output:
The value of `a[0]` is not explicitly given, but we know that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1. This means `a[0]` could be any integer such that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1. However, without the specific list `l` and the value of `a[0]`, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[0]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is an integer such that l[a[0] - 1] is 1)**
