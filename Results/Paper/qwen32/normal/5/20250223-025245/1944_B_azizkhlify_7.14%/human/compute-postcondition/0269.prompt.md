Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`; `ur` is 0; `re` is 0; `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a non-zero integer and `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`; `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`. `ur` is 0. `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `re` is 0. `n` is a positive integer. `k` is a non-zero integer and `k` is `2 * k - ul`. `a` is a list of integers read from input. `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`. `res` is a list containing `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `res` is an empty list. If `re` is equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`. `ur` is 0. `re` is `re + 1` if `l[a[4] - 1] == 1`; otherwise, `re` remains unchanged. `n` is a positive integer. `k` is a non-zero integer and `k` is `2 * k - ul`. `a` is a list of integers read from input. `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`. `res` is a list containing `a[4]` if `l[a[4] - 1] == 1`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `i` is 4. If `re` is equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`. `ur` is 0. `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[4] - 1] == 1` and `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`. `n` is a positive integer. `k` is a non-zero integer and `k` is `2 * k - ul`. `a` is a list of integers read from input. `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`. `res` contains `a[4]` and `a[5]` if `l[a[4] - 1] == 1`. `i` is 5. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
