Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n remains the first integer read from the input, a remains the list of n integers read from the input, l remains a list of n integers where each element at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of a[i] in a, r is a list of n integers where each element at index a[i] - 1 has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of a[i] in the range from a[n] to a[2*n - 1], ul is either k * 2 if the loop broke or less than k * 2 if the loop completed all iterations, ur remains 0, res is an empty list, k is updated to 2 * k - ul if non-zero, re is the number of times l[a[i] - 1] was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed, and ul is not equal to ur.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is the same as before. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, and `n` is the same as before. If `ul == ur`, then the loop or if statement breaks out. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, `i` is incremented by 3; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
