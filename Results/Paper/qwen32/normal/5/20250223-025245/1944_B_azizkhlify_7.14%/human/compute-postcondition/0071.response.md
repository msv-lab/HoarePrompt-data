To determine the output of the statement `print(i, end=' ')`, we need to analyze the given initial state and identify the current value of the variable `i`.

From the provided initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`.
- `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations.
- `ur` remains 0.
- `res` is a list containing at least one element.
- `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` if non-zero.
- `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed.

However, the exact state of `i` is not provided in the initial state. The variable `i` could be any integer value depending on where in the code this print statement is located. Without knowing the specific loop or context in which this `print(i, end=' ')` statement is placed, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Given this information, we can only describe the output in terms of `i`:

Output: **i (where i is the current value of the loop index or variable i at the point of execution)**
