Postcondition: **`r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.**
