Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each time `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` occurred up to the point where the loop breaks or all iterations are completed, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `k` is a non-zero integer (`k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not equal to 0), `re` is 0, `i` is the index at which the loop stopped.**
