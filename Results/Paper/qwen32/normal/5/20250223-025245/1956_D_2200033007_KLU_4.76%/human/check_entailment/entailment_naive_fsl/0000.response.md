Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The program simply checks if the length of the array is 2 or not and prints predefined outputs without performing any operations on the array to maximize the sum. This approach does not handle all potential cases and specifically does not handle cases where the length of the array is not 2. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 3 9
```
The program should output:
```
13 0
```
But the program does not handle this case correctly. It only outputs `13 0` when the length of the array is not 2, which is incorrect for arrays of length 1 and other lengths where the MEX operation could increase the sum.

Another example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program should output:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
But the program does not handle this case correctly and outputs:
```
13 0
```
which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
