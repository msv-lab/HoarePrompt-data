Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. It simply checks if the length of the array `c` is equal to 2 and prints a predefined output for that case. For all other cases, it prints another predefined output. This approach does not consider the actual values in the array or the MEX operation that needs to be performed to maximize the sum of the array.

The program should:
1. Calculate the MEX of different subarrays.
2. Perform the operation to set the subarray to the MEX value.
3. Maximize the sum of the array through these operations.
4. Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

The provided code does none of these steps. It only checks the length of the array and prints fixed outputs, which does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
