### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings `na`.
   - It then appends each element of `na` to the list `a` without converting them to integers.
   - **Issue**: The list `a` contains strings, not integers. This will cause issues when trying to perform any numerical operations.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `c`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program checks if `c` (which is the length of the array) is equal to 2.
     - If `c == 2`, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.
   - **Issue**: This logic is hardcoded and does not consider the actual values in the array or the MEX calculation required by the problem.

3. **Output**:
   - The output is hardcoded based solely on the length of the array.
   - **Issue**: This does not reflect the actual maximum sum or the operations needed to achieve it.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that `c` is the length of the array and not the array itself.
   - The annotations also confirm that the program prints hardcoded values without considering the array's contents.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as it:
- Does not convert the input array elements to integers.
- Only handles two hardcoded cases based on the length of the array.
- Does not implement the logic to calculate the MEX or to maximize the sum of the array.

Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
