Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The program checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints predefined outputs without performing any operations on the array to maximize the sum. This approach does not handle all potential cases and specifically does not handle cases where the length of the array is not 2.

Here are some examples to illustrate the issues:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   3
   1 3 9
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   13 0
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   13 0
   ```
   While the output is correct for this specific case, the program does not handle this case by performing the necessary operations to determine the MEX and maximize the sum. It simply outputs `13 0` because the length of the array is not 2.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   4
   1 100 2 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   105 2
   3 3
   3 4
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   13 0
   ```
   The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect for this case. The program should perform the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   0
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1 1
   1 1
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   13 0
   ```
   The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect for this case. The program should perform the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array.

The program does not correctly handle the MEX operation and does not perform any operations on the array to maximize the sum for any array length other than 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
