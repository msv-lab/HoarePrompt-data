Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The program simply checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints predefined outputs without performing any operations on the array to maximize the sum. This approach does not handle all potential cases and specifically does not handle cases where the length of the array is not 2.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Handling Specific Cases:**
   - For an array of length 2, the program correctly outputs `4 1` followed by `1 2`. However, this is hardcoded and does not follow the MEX operation logic to ensure the maximum sum.
   - For arrays of other lengths, including length 1, the program outputs `13 0`, which is not always correct. For example, with the input `1`, the correct output should be `1 1` followed by `1 1`, as the MEX operation can increase the sum by setting the single element to 1.

2. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program does not perform the MEX operation to maximize the sum for arrays of any length. It should iterate through the array, compute the MEX for each possible subarray, and perform the operations to maximize the sum.
   - The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` does not perform any operations on the array and only prints predefined outputs based on the length of the array.

3. **Examples Provided:**
   - **Example 1:**
     ```
     Input:
     2
     0 1
     Output:
     4 1
     1 2
     ```
     The program correctly outputs `4 1` followed by `1 2`, but this is hardcoded and does not follow the MEX operation logic.
   - **Example 2:**
     ```
     Input:
     3
     1 3 9
     Output:
     13 0
     ```
     The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect because the maximum sum can be achieved by performing operations to increase the sum.
   - **Example 3:**
     ```
     Input:
     4
     1 100 2 1
     Output:
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
     The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect for the same reason as above.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the solution as it does not perform the MEX operations to maximize the sum of the array for all possible input cases.

Final: **False**
