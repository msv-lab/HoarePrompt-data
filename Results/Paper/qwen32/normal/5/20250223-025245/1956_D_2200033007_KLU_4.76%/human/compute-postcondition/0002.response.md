The initial state describes a list `c` of integers with certain constraints, and an integer `m` initialized to 0. However, the value of `c` being equal to 2 seems to be a mistake since `c` is described as a list. Despite this discrepancy, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `c` or `m`. It directly prints the string `'4 1'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(f'4 1')`.
2. The `f` before the string indicates that it is an f-string, but there are no variables inside the curly braces `{}` that would be replaced with their values.
3. Therefore, the string `'4 1'` is printed as-is.

Output: **4 1**
