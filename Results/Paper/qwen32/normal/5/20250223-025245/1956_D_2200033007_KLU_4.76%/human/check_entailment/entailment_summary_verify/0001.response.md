Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's break down the issues based on the problem description, the program code, and the function summary:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input but does not convert the array elements to integers. The list `a` contains string representations of the integers, which is incorrect for any calculations or comparisons that involve numeric values.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program only handles two cases based on the length of the array (`c`), which is incorrect. The function `func_1` checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints a hardcoded output. For any other length, it prints another hardcoded output. This does not implement the required logic to calculate the MEX or to maximize the sum of the array based on the problem's requirements.
   - The function summary correctly states that `func_1` only handles the length of the array and does not consider the actual values in the array, the MEX calculation, or the operations required to maximize the sum.

3. **Output**:
   - The output is hardcoded. For an array of length 2, it outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, and for any other length, it outputs `13 0`. This does not reflect the actual maximum sum or the operations needed to achieve it.
   - The program does not provide the correct maximum sum or the sequence of operations that achieve this sum, as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem and does not implement the necessary logic to compute the MEX or to maximize the sum of the array.

Final: **False**
