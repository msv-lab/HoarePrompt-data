The given `print` statement is `print(f'13 0')`. This statement is a formatted string that directly contains the values '13' and '0', and it does not depend on any variables or the initial state provided. The initial state describes properties of a list `c` and a variable `m`, but these do not influence the output of this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be exactly the string '13 0'.

Output: **13 0**
