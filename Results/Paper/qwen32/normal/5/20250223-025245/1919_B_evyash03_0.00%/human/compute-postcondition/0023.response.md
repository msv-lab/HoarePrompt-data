Given the code snippet `balance += 1`, we need to update the value of `balance` by adding 1 to its current value. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `count`, and `char`) remain unchanged.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step impact:
1. `balance` is incremented by 1.
2. The values of `expression`, `length`, `count`, and `char` are not altered by this statement.

The initial state specifies that `balance` is 0 if it was less than 0 before the if-else block, otherwise it is incremented by 1 if `char` is '+', and decremented by 1 if `char` is '-' and `balance` was not less than 0. 

Since the code snippet `balance += 1` is executed regardless of the previous state of `balance`, we can conclude that `balance` will be increased by 1 from whatever its previous value was.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is either 1 or 2 if `balance` was less than 0 before the if-else block, otherwise `count` remains 0; `balance` is incremented by 1; `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
