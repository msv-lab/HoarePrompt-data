Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to split the given string `s` (consisting of `+` and `-`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to get the minimum penalty.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Splitting the String:**
   ```python
   parts = expression.split('-')
   result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
   ```
   This part of the code splits the string `expression` by `-` and sums the lengths of the resulting parts. This does not help in calculating the minimum penalty because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(expression, length):
       count = 0
       balance = 0
       for char in expression:
           if char == '+':
               balance += 1
           elif char == '-':
               balance -= 1
           if balance < 0:
               count += 1
               balance = 0
       return count + (balance > 0)
   ```
   This function is intended to count the number of times the balance (the sum of the subarray) goes negative and adds an extra count if the balance is positive at the end. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It does not consider the length of the subarrays or the absolute value of their sums.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm is typically used. The idea is to find the optimal way to split the array such that the sum of penalties is minimized. This involves considering the balance of the subarrays and their lengths.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

Correctness: **False**
