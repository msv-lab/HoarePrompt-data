Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1, `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`, `count` is 1 if `balance` was less than 0, otherwise `count` remains 0. If `char` is '-', then `balance` is `balance - 1` if `balance` was not less than 0, or `balance` remains 0 if `balance` was less than 0. `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
