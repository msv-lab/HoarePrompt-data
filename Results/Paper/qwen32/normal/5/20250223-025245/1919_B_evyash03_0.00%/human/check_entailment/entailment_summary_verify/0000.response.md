### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to split the array derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for each subarray `c` is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the minimum penalty. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The program splits the string `expression` using `split('-')`, which is not a valid way to split the array into non-empty subarrays as required by the problem.
   - The `result_length` calculated is not used meaningfully in the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the penalty but does so incorrectly. It increments `count` whenever `balance` becomes negative, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.
   - The final penalty calculation `count + (balance > 0)` does not take into account the optimal splits needed to minimize the penalty.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary describes `func_1` as returning the number of times the cumulative balance of '+' and '-' characters became negative and was reset to zero, plus one if the final balance is positive. This does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated greedy algorithm is needed to find the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty. The provided program does not implement such an approach.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the program's logic and the mismatch between the function summary and the problem requirements, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (This is incorrect based on the original assessment, so we need to confirm the original assessment is correct)

Since the original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the program, the final evaluation should reflect that the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
