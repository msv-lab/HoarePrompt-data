### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The program splits the string `expression` using `split('-')`, which is not a valid way to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that their concatenation equals `a`.
   - The variable `result_length` is calculated as the sum of lengths of parts obtained from splitting by `'-'`, which is irrelevant to the problem of finding the optimal splits.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the penalty. It increments `count` whenever `balance` becomes negative, which does not correspond to the optimal way to determine the splits.
   - The final penalty calculation `count + (balance > 0)` does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves using dynamic programming to find the optimal way to split the array `a` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The corrected version of the program uses a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray and a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the minimum penalty for splitting the array up to each index.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

### Final: **False**
