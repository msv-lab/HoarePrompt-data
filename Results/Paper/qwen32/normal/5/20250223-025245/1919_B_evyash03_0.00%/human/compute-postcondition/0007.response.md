Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1, `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`, `count` is 0, `balance` is -1, `char` is equal to '-'**

Explanation: The value of `balance` is decremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
