### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program more closely to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to split the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty is defined as the absolute value of the sum of a subarray multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to achieve the minimum penalty.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two main parts:
1. **Splitting the String:**
   ```python
   parts = expression.split('-')
   result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
   ```
   This part splits the string by `-` and sums the lengths of the resulting parts. However, this approach does not help in optimally splitting the string to minimize the penalty. It simply counts the lengths of segments separated by `-`, which is not relevant to the optimal splitting strategy.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(expression, length):
       count = 0
       balance = 0
       for char in expression:
           if char == '+':
               balance += 1
           elif char == '-':
               balance -= 1
           if balance < 0:
               count += 1
               balance = 0
       return count + (balance > 0)
   ```
   This function counts the number of times the cumulative balance (difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters) goes negative and resets it to zero. It also adds one if the final balance is positive. This count does not directly correspond to the minimum penalty. The function is attempting to count the number of subarrays that need to be created to ensure the balance never goes negative, but it does not take into account the length of these subarrays or their penalties.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem optimally, a dynamic programming or greedy approach is typically used. The idea is to find the optimal way to split the array such that the sum of penalties is minimized. This involves considering the balance of the subarrays and their lengths.

#### Evaluation:
Given the provided program and its function summary, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. The function `func_1` does not consider the length of the subarrays or the absolute value of their sums, which are crucial for calculating the penalty. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the minimum penalty by optimally splitting the string.

Final: **False**
