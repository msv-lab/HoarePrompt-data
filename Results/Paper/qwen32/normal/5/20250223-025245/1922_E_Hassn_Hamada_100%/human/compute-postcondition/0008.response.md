Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`, `size` is 2, `i` is 0, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `size`, which has been incremented by 1 from its initial value of 1 to 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
