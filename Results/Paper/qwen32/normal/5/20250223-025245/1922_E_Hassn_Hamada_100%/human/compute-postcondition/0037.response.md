To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `sequence`. 

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration.

### Analysis:

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number\).
   - `value` is \((1 << size) - 1\).
   - If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple (`size`, `i`) and the loop or if statement is exited.
   - Otherwise, no change occurs.

2. **Adjustments for the next iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` is decremented by `1` in each iteration.
   - The `sequence` is not modified within the loop head, so it remains the same.

### Adjusted State:

- Since `i` is decremented by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `sequence` remains unchanged.

### Final State:

If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x - 1`.

State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number\), `value` is \((1 << size) - 1\), `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the new value of `i` as `previous_i - 1`.

State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number\), `value` is \((1 << size) - 1\), `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`**.
