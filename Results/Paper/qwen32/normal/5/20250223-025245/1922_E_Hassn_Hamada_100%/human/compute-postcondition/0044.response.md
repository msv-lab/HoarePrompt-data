The given code snippet modifies the `value` variable based on the current values of `size` and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the calculation:

- `size` is initially `previous_i + 2`
- `i` is initially `previous_i - 1`
- `value` is recalculated as `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which translates to `2^size - 2^i` using the left shift operator.

Let's substitute the values:
- `2^size` becomes `2^(previous_i + 2)`
- `2^i` becomes `2^(previous_i - 1)`

Therefore, the new `value` is `2^(previous_i + 2) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`.

Output State: **`size` is `previous_i + 2`, `value` is `2^(previous_i + 2) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `number` must be at least `(7/2) * 2^(previous_i)`**.
