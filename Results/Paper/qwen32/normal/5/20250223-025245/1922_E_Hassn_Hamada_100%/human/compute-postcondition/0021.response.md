To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop statement is:

```python
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters derived from `sequence`.

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: This is the loop variable that gets decremented by 1 in each iteration.
2. **`max(sequence, default=0)`**: This determines the starting point of the loop. If `sequence` is empty, it defaults to 0.
3. **`-1`**: This is the endpoint of the loop (exclusive).
4. **`-1`**: This is the step, indicating that `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Given State:
- `number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000).
- `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
- `size` is 10.
- `i` is 1.
- `value` is 1022.
- If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is (10, 1) and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `size_overlap` remains (0, 0).

### State Adjustment:
- Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Conclusion:
- The next value of `i` should be 0 (since it is decremented by 1 from the previous value of 1).
- The other variables (`number`, `sequence`, `size`, `value`, `size_overlap`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size` is 10, `i` is 0, `value` is 1022**.
