The provided code snippet involves a function call `func_1` with two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`. The variable `sequence` remains unchanged as it is passed as an argument to the function without any modifications. The value of `number` is transformed using bitwise operations and passed as the first argument to `func_1`.

Given the initial state, `sequence` is a list containing integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`. This list remains unchanged by the provided code snippet. The function `func_1` is called with a computed value based on `number`, `size`, and `overlap`, but since the function itself is not defined in the snippet, we cannot determine any further changes to the program state beyond the call to `func_1`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `sequence` remains the same, and a function `func_1` is called with the computed first argument and the original `sequence`.

Output State: **`sequence` is a list containing integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`; `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`.**
