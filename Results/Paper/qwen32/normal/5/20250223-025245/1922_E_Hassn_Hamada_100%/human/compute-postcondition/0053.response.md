To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `size`, `value`, and `size_overlap`.

The loop iterates from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to 0. For each iteration, it calculates `size` and `value` and checks if `value` is less than or equal to `number`. If it is, it sets `size_overlap` to `(size, i)` and breaks out of the loop.

From the given outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `size` is 10, `i` is 1, `value` is 1022.
   - If `value` (1022) is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is set to `(10, 1)` and the loop breaks.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `size` is the smallest integer such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number`.
   - `value` is `(1 << size) - 1`.
   - If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is set to `(size, i)` and the loop breaks.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `size` is `previous_i + n`, `value` is `2^(previous_i + n) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`.
   - `i` is `previous_i - 1`.
   - If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is set to `(previous_i + n, previous_i - 1)` and the loop breaks.

The loop will continue to iterate until it finds a `value` that is less than or equal to `number` or until `i` reaches -1. The loop breaks as soon as it finds such a `value`.

Given the nature of the loop, the output state after all iterations will be when `size_overlap` is set to the first `(size, i)` pair where `value` is less than or equal to `number`. If no such pair is found, `size_overlap` remains `(0, 0)`.

Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds a valid `value`, the final `size_overlap` will be the first valid pair encountered.

Output State: **size_overlap is the first (size, i) pair where value = (1 << size) - (1 << i) is less than or equal to number.**

In simpler terms, the output state will be the first pair `(size, i)` where the calculated `value` is less than or equal to `number`, and this pair will be stored in `size_overlap`. If no such pair is found, `size_overlap` remains `(0, 0)`.
