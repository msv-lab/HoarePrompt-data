Reasoning:  
The provided execution summary indicates a misunderstanding of the function `func_1`'s purpose and behavior. According to the problem description, the function `func_1` should generate a sequence of numbers such that the array formed by these numbers has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the summary states that `func_1` always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`, which is not consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list by appending integers to it based on the value of `number`. The goal is to construct a sequence that results in the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `number + 1` (since the function is called with `n - 1`).

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to generate such a sequence and instead returns a tuple `(0, 0)` regardless of the input, which is incorrect. This behavior does not match the requirements of the problem description, and the function does not generate the desired output.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
