You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `sequence`, a list of integers. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the tuple (0, 0).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if it correctly solves the problem described. The problem requires constructing an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, or determining that it's impossible to do so.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are in strictly increasing order.
   - We need to find an array such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The array length must be at most 200.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer X.
   - It then calls `func_1(n - 1, result)`, where `n` is the input X, and `result` is an initially empty list.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number.
   - After generating the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1` Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a number and a list to populate with the sequence.
   - It starts by checking if the number is zero. If so, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - It then iterates over possible sizes of subsequences, calculating the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed.
   - It tries to find the largest subsequence size that fits within the remaining number of subsequences.
   - It appends the calculated values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` seems to be attempting to solve the problem by generating a sequence that corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not directly generate the sequence in a way that guarantees exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The logic of the function is not straightforward and does not provide a clear mapping from the number of subsequences to the array elements.
   - The function also does not handle the case where it's impossible to construct such an array, which should result in `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly X increasing subsequences, and it does not handle cases where it's impossible to construct such an array.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
