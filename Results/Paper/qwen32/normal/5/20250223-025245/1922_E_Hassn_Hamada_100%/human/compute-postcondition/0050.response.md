The code assigns the tuple `(size, i)` to the variable `size_overlap`. The values of `size` and `i` are not changed by this assignment, but `size_overlap` is now defined.

Output State: **size is `previous_i + n`, value is `2^(previous_i + n) - 2^(previous_i - 1)` and is less than or equal to number, sequence is unchanged, i is `previous_i - 1`, size_overlap is (`previous_i + n`, `previous_i - 1`)**
