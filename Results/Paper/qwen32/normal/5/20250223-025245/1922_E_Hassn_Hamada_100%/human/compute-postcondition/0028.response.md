The variable `value` is assigned the value of `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. The variable `size` is increased by 1, so `size` now holds its new value. The variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `size` is increased by 1, and `value` is calculated as `(1 << (size - 1) + 1) - (1 << i)`.

Output State: **`size` is increased by 1; `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`**
