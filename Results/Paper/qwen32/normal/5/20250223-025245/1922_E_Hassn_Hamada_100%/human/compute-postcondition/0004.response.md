The provided Python code snippet assigns the tuple `(0, 0)` to the variable `size_overlap`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the only change is that `size_overlap` now holds the value `(0, 0)`.

Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the required number of increasing subsequences for the corresponding test case. `number` is not equal to 0; `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`**.
