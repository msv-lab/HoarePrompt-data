The code snippet `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)` updates the value of `value` based on the current values of `size` and `i`. 

Given:
- `size` is `previous_i + 1`
- `i` is `previous_i - 1`

Let's substitute these into the equation:
- `1 << size` is equivalent to `2^(previous_i + 1)`
- `1 << i` is equivalent to `2^(previous_i - 1)`

Thus, the new `value` becomes:
\[ \text{value} = 2^{(\text{previous\_i} + 1)} - 2^{(\text{previous\_i} - 1)} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{value} = 2 \cdot 2^{\text{previous\_i}} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^{\text{previous\_i}} = \left(2 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot 2^{\text{previous\_i}} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 2^{\text{previous\_i}} \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` is `previous_i + 1`, `value` is `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `number` must be at least `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`**
