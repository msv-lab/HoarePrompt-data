The code snippet increments the variable `size` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `size` was `previous_i`, so after the increment, `size` becomes `previous_i + 1`.

Output State: **`size` is `previous_i + 1`, `value` is `2^(previous_i - 1)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `number` must be at least `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`**
