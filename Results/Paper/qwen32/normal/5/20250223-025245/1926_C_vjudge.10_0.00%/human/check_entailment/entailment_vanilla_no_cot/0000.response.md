Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `N` but then uses a loop to read `N` values of `n` without resetting the `soma` variable between test cases. This means that the sum from previous test cases will carry over to subsequent ones, which is incorrect.

2. The program also defines the function `func_1` after it has been used in the loop, which will cause a `NameError` because Python requires functions to be defined before they are called.

3. The inner loop should start from 1 to `n` inclusive, not from 0 to `n-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    soma = 0
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This version correctly resets `soma` for each test case, starts the inner loop from 1, and defines `func_1` before using it.
