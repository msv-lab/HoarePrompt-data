### Reasoning:

The program is designed to compute the maximum profit Bob can make by selling his buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Determine `k`**: The value of `k` is determined as `min(n, b - a)`. This is because:
   - If `b - a` is greater than `n`, then Bob can only sell `n` buns at the modified price.
   - If `b - a` is less than or equal to `n`, then Bob can sell up to `b - a` buns at the modified price.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it's not beneficial to sell any buns at the modified price, so Bob sells all buns at the usual price `a`. The total profit is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit calculation is split into two parts:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. The prices for these buns form an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, down to `b - k + 1`. The sum of this arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \times \text{number of terms} / 2\). Here, the first term is `b`, the last term is `b - k + 1`, and the number of terms is `k`. Thus, the sum is \((b + (b - k + 1)) * k / 2\).
     - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the calculated total profit.

This logic aligns with the problem description and the provided example outputs. The implementation correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `b <= a` and when `b - a` is greater than `n`.

### Correctness: **True**
