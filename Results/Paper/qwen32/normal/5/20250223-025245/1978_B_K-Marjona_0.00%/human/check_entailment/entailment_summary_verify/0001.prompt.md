You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of purchasing all `n` buns, considering that the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1` (where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b-a`), and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic step by step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) such that:
- The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
- The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can achieve.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and then calculates the maximum profit as follows:
1. It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
2. If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so it sells all buns at the usual price `a` and prints `a * n`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`:
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and ending at `b - k + 1` is `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided test cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit: `(5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) // 2 * 1 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `(9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 35 + 0 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit: Since `b <= a`, it's `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `(11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 + 0 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: Since `b <= a`, it's `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: Since `b <= a`, it's `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit: `(1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1)) // 2 * 999 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 500500 + 1 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (Correct)

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for all the provided test cases.
