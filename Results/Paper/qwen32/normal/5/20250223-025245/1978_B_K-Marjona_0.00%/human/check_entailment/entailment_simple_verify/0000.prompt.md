You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)

        else:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling \( n \) buns with the given pricing rules.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Calculating \( k \)**: For each test case, it calculates \( k = \min(n, b - a) \). This \( k \) represents the number of buns to be sold at the modified price.
3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If \( b \leq a \), it sells all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - Otherwise, it sells the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

### Potential Issues

Let's check if the program handles all edge cases and potential scenarios correctly:
- **Case 1**: \( b \leq a \)
  - The program correctly sells all buns at the usual price \( a \).
- **Case 2**: \( b > a \)
  - The program calculates \( k = \min(n, b - a) \) and then calculates the profit as:
    \[
    \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2}\right) \cdot k + (n - k) \cdot a
    \]
  - This formula calculates the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1, and then adds the profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples and some edge cases:
1. **Example 1**: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \)
   - \( k = \min(4, 5 - 4) = 1 \)
   - Profit = \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \) (Correct)
2. **Example 2**: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
   - \( k = \min(5, 9 - 5) = 4 \)
   - Profit = \( (9 + 6) \cdot 4 / 2 + (5 - 4) \cdot 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \) (Correct)
3. **Example 3**: \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \)
   - \( k = \min(10, 5 - 10) = 0 \)
   - Profit = \( 10 \cdot 10 = 100 \) (Correct)
4. **Example 4**: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
   - \( k = \min(5, 11 - 5) = 5 \)
   - Profit = \( (11 + 6) \cdot 5 / 2 = 42.5 \) (This should be an integer, so the correct calculation is \( (11 + 7) \cdot 5 / 2 = 45 \)) (Correct)
5. **Example 5**: \( n = 10^9 \), \( a = 10^9 \), \( b = 10^9 \)
   - \( k = \min(10^9, 10^9 - 10^9) = 0 \)
   - Profit = \( 10^9 \cdot 10^9 = 10^{18} \) (Correct)
6. **Example 6**: \( n = 10^9 \), \( a = 10^9 \), \( b = 1 \)
   - \( k = \min(10^9, 1 - 10^9) = 0 \)
   - Profit = \( 10^9 \cdot 10^9 = 10^{18} \) (Correct)
7. **Example 7**: \( n = 1000 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1000 \)
   - \( k = \min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999 \)
   - Profit = \( (1000 + 2) \cdot 999 / 2 + (1000 - 999) \cdot 1 = 500500 \) (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases. It calculates the maximum profit based on the given conditions and handles both scenarios where \( b \leq a \) and \( b > a \) appropriately.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for all test cases by considering the optimal number of buns to be sold at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for all the test cases and potential scenarios.
