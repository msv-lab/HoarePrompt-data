The value of `k` is assigned the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is `min(n, b - a)`**.
