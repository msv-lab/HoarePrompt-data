Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` and `j` are values based on the comparisons made during the loop. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and no further changes are made to the variables.**
