Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `2 * max(t1, t2)`; `k` is len(a); `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `i` is 1; `j` is either 1 or 2.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
