Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where all elements are the same.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input where all elements are the same.
- The first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(0)
```

**Analysis:**
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `c`. The statement `print(0)` will always output the integer `0` regardless of the values of the other variables.

**Output:**
Output: **0**
