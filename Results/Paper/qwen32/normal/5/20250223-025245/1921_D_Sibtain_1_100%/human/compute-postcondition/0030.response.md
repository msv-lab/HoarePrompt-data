The code snippet provided increments `ans` by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. Since `t1` and `t2` are already defined, we need to update `ans` accordingly.

Given the initial state, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from a previous calculation. The code snippet adds another `max(t1, t2)` to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from the previous calculation plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from the current calculation; `i` is 0 if `t2 > t1` else 1; `j` is 3 if `t2 > t1` else 2; `k` is incremented by 1; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**
