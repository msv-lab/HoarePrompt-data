Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0]); `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that a new variable `t2` has been introduced and assigned the value of the absolute difference between the last elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted (in descending order) list `c`. All other variables retain their initial values.
