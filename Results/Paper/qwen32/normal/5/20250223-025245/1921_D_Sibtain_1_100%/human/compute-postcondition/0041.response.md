The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state of `n` and `m` is not specified, but after the execution of the code, `n` and `m` will hold the values provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration; `i` is a value between 0 and len(a) - 1; `j` is a value between 1 and len(a); `k` is len(a) - 1**
