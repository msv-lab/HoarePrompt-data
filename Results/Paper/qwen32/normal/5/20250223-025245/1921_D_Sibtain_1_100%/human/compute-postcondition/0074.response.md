Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 2; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` where `j` is either 2 or 4 if `t2 > t1`, otherwise `j` is either 1 or 3; `i` is either 1 or 2 if `t2 > t1`, otherwise `i` is either 2 or 3.**
