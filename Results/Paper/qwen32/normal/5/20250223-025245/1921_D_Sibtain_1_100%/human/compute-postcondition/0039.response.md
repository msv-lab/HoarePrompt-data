To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. **`n` and `m`**: Integers obtained from the input.
3. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers obtained from the input, with at least 1 element.
4. **`c`**: A list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order.
5. **`ans`**: The sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration.
6. **`i`**: A value between 0 and `len(a) - 1`.
7. **`j`**: A value between 1 and `len(a)`.
8. **`k`**: The value `len(a) - 1`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is described as the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration. However, the specific values of `t1` and `t2` are not explicitly provided in the initial state. Therefore, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `t1` and `t2` in each iteration.

### Output Description:
Given the information, we can describe `ans` as the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, but we cannot provide a specific numerical value without more details about `t1` and `t2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum of t1 and t2 for each iteration)**
