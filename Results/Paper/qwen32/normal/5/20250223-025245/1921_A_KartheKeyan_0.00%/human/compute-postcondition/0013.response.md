The code snippet appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new tuple `(x, y)` is added to the end of the `coord` list, which initially contains two tuples. Therefore, the `coord` list will now have three tuples.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `((x, y), (x, y), (x, y))`, `res` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is 4**.
