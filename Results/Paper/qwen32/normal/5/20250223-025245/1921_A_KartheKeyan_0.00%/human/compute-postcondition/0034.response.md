Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a sorted list with 8 elements, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `i` is 4.**

The list `coord` has been sorted, but the specific values of its elements are not known. The variables `n`, `res`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `coord` which is now a sorted list.
