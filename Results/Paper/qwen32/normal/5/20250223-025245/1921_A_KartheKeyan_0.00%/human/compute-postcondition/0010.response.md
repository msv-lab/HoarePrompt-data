The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new state of `coord` will include the original tuple `(x, y)` plus the newly appended tuple `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `((x, y), (x, y))`, `res` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is 3**.
