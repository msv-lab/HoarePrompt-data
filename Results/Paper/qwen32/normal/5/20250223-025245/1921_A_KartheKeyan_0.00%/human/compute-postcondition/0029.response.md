The code snippet appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the `coord` list. This means that the length of `coord` increases by one, and the new tuple is added as the last element of the list. The values of `n`, `res`, `p1`, `p2`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 6 elements (the original 5 elements plus the appended `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` and `y` are the new input integers, `i` is 3.**
