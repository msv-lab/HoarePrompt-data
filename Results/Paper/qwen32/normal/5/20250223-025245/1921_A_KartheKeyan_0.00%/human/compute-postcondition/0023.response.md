Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is `[]`, `res` is `0`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

The value of `res` has been changed to `0`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Since `coord` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` will raise an `IndexError` if accessed, but their expressions are preserved as per the initial state.
