The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. This changes the length of `coord` by adding one more element. The values of `n`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the append operation. The new state of `coord` will include the newly appended tuple at the end.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 5 elements (the original 4 elements plus the appended `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**
