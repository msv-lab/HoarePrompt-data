The code snippet updates the values of `x` and `y` by reading a new pair of integers from the input and splitting them. The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is 0.**
