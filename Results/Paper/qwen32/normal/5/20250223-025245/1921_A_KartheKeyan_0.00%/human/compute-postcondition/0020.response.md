Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))` based on ascending x and then y values, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

The value of `n` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
