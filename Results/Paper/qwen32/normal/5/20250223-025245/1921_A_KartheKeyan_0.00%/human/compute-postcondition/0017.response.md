The code calculates the value of `p2` based on the differences in the x and y coordinates of the last two tuples in the sorted list `coord`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `p1` remain unchanged. The specific value of `p2` is calculated as the sum of the squared differences in the x and y coordinates of the fourth and third tuples in `coord`.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))` based on ascending x and then y values, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**.
