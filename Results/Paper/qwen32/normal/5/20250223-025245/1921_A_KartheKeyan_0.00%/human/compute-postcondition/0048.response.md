Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The `coord` list now contains two tuples, both of which are `(x, y)`, because a new tuple `(x, y)` was appended to it. The values of `n`, `res`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
