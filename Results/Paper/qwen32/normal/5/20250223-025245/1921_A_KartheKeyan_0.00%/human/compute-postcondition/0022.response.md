The code snippet provided sets the `coord` variable to an empty list. The values of `n`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment to `coord`.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is `[]`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In simpler terms, `coord` is now an empty list, while `n`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` retain their original values.
