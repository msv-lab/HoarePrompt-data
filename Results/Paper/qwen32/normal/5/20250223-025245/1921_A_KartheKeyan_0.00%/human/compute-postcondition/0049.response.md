The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `4`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `4`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by `1`, making `i` equal to `1`.

The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `x`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is 1**
