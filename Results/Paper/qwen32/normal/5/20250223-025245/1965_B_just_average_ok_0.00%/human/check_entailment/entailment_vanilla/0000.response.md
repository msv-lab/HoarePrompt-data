Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Given two integers `n` and `k`, we need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the Initial Sequence**:
   - It initializes the sequence `nums` with powers of 2 up to `2^23` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 8388608]`). This is a common technique to generate numbers that can sum up to any number using binary representation.

3. **Adjusting for `k`**:
   - It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than `k` by incrementing `idx` until `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) is greater than or equal to `k`. It then decrements `idx` to get the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It adds three numbers to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `nums`.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.
   - It removes `nums[idx]` from `nums` (the largest power of 2 less than `k`).

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

### Verification of the Program:

- **Condition 1: No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
  - By removing `nums[idx]` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, it ensures that the sum of `nums[idx]` and any subsequence that would have summed to `k` now sums to `k - nums[idx]` plus some other numbers, which will not be `k` because `k - nums[idx]` is not a power of 2 and cannot be formed by the remaining powers of 2.

- **Condition 2: All Other Numbers Can Be Formed**:
  - The initial sequence of powers of 2 can form any number up to `2^24 - 1` by binary representation.
  - By adding `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, it ensures that these specific numbers can be formed.
  - By removing `nums[idx]`, it ensures that `k` cannot be formed, but it doesn't affect the formation of any other number up to `n` (as long as `n < 2^24`).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the constraints and conditions specified in the problem. It generates a sequence that meets the requirements for all test cases within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
