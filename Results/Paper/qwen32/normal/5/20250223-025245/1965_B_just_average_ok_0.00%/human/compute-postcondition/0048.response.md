The code appends a new element to the list `nums`. This new element is calculated as `k - nums[idx]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is the largest integer such that 2^idx <= k and idx <= 24, decremented by 1.

After the code executes:
- The list `nums` will have an additional element at the end, which is `k - nums[idx]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`]; `idx` is the largest integer such that 2^idx <= k and idx <= 24, decremented by 1.**
