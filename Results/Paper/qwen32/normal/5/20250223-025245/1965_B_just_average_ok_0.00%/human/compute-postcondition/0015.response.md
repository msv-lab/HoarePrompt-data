The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element at the position `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given `idx` is 23, `1 << 23` equals `8388608`. However, the list `nums` does not include `8388608`. The list `nums` contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) and then some additional values: `k - 4194304`, `k + 1`, `k + 4194305`. Since `8388608` is not in the list, the `remove` operation will result in a `ValueError` if the code is executed as-is. Assuming the task is to remove the element at index `idx` (23) from the list `nums`, the element at index 23 is `4194304` (which is \(2^{22}\)). Therefore, the element `4194304` will be removed from the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is less than 16777216, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, `k - 4194304`, `k + 1`, `k + 4194305`], `idx` is 23.**
