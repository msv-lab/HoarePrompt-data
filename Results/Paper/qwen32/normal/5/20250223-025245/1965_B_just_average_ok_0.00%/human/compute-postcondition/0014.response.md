The code appends a new value to the `nums` list. This new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 23, we know `nums[23]` is `4194304`. Therefore, the new value being appended is `k + 4194304 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is less than 16777216, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, `k - 4194304`, `k + 1`, `k + 4194305`], `idx` is 23.**
