To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is less than 16777216.
- `nums` is a list of integers defined as `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, k - 4194304, k + 1, k + 4194305]`.
- `idx` is 23.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(nums))
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the length of the list `nums`. To find the length of the list, we need to count the number of elements in `nums`.

From the definition of `nums`, we can see that it contains the following elements:
1. The first 22 elements are powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{21}\).
2. The next 3 elements are \(k - 4194304\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 4194305\).

So, the total number of elements in `nums` is:
\[ 22 + 3 = 25 \]

### Output:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will output the length of the list `nums`, which is 25.

Output: **25**
