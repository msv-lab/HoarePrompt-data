The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the range provided by `int(input())`. This means that as long as there are more iterations to be performed according to the input, the loop will continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs to be considered for the next iteration is the input value that determines how many more times the loop will run. Since the loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, and we are at the start of the next iteration, the loop counter (which is not explicitly shown but is implied by the range) will have been incremented by 1.

However, since the loop head does not contain any variables that we can directly modify, and the state provided does not include any explicit loop counter, we can only infer that the loop will continue to run as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` has not been reached.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same with respect to the variables provided, except we understand that the loop will execute again if there are remaining iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + 2]` with the element `1 << idx` removed.**
