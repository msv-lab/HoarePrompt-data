The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `idx` is 0, so after the operation, `idx` becomes 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608], `idx` is 1**
