The code snippet provided initializes a variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the variable `idx` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]; `idx` is 0.**
