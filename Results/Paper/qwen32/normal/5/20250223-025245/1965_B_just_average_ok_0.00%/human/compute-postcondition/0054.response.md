To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. The loop processes `t` test cases, each with values `n` and `k`. The value of `n` is not used within the loop, so we can ignore it. The value of `k` is used to modify a list `nums` which initially contains powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).

Here's a step-by-step description of the process for each test case:

1. **Initialization**: The list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
2. **Finding `idx`**: The variable `idx` is determined such that \(2^{idx}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - Remove \(2^{idx}\) from `nums`.
   - Append `k - 2^{idx}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{idx} + 1` to `nums`.
4. **Output**: The length of `nums` and the elements of `nums` are printed.

Given that `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case modifies `nums` independently, the state after all iterations is simply the state after processing all `t` test cases. The final output state will be the results of the last test case processed, as each test case's output is independent of the previous ones.

Since the output state after the loop executes all iterations is the same as the output state of the last test case, we can describe it as follows:

**Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

The output state after all iterations is the state after the last test case is processed. Specifically, it will be:
- The length of the modified `nums` list.
- The elements of the modified `nums` list.

Given the pattern from the first three iterations, the output state after the last iteration will be:

Output State: **the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums` after processing the last test case.**

To put it simply:
- The length of `nums` will be 25 (since we start with 24 elements and add 3 while removing 1).
- The elements of `nums` will be the initial powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) except \(2^{idx}\), plus `k - 2^{idx}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{idx} + 1` for the last test case.

In natural language, the final output state after all iterations is the length of the modified list `nums` (which is 25) and the elements of `nums` after processing the last test case, where `nums` contains the initial powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) except the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` for the last test case, plus `k - 2^{idx}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{idx} + 1`.

Output State: **25 followed by the elements of `nums` after processing the last test case.**
