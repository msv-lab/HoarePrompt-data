Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]**.

The variable `nums` has been created and assigned a list of 24 integers, where each integer is a power of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
