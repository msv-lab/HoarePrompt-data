You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Logic for Matching Template**:
   - The code checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If it is, the code immediately prints "NO" and moves to the next test case. This part is correct.
   - However, the subsequent logic is flawed. The code iterates over each character in `c` and checks if the character is not in the corresponding position in both `a` and `b`. If it finds such a character, it prints "YES" and breaks the loop. This is incorrect because the template can have uppercase letters that specify a character that must be different from a specific lowercase letter in `a` or `b`, not just any character not present in both.

2. **Template Matching Conditions**:
   - The template can have lowercase letters that must match the corresponding letters in `a` and `b`.
   - The template can have uppercase letters that must not match the corresponding letters in `a` and `b` (specifically, the lowercase version of the uppercase letter).

3. **Incorrect Handling of Template Conditions**:
   - The code does not correctly implement the template matching conditions. It only checks if the character in `c` is not in the corresponding positions in `a` and `b`, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

4. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     2
     ab
     cd
     ef
     ```
   - The correct template could be "AB" because:
     - 'a' and 'c' are different from 'A' (lowercase 'a' and 'c' are not 'A').
     - 'b' and 'd' are different from 'B' (lowercase 'b' and 'd' are not 'B').
     - 'e' and 'f' are different from 'A' and 'B' (lowercase 'e' and 'f' are not 'A' or 'B').
   - However, the program would not correctly identify this template and might incorrectly print "NO".

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each position, determine if the characters in `a` and `b` are the same or different.
   - If they are the same, the template must have an uppercase letter that is not equal to the lowercase version of that character.
   - If they are different, the template can have either a lowercase letter that matches both or an uppercase letter that is not equal to the lowercase version of either character.
   - Check if there exists a template where `c` does not match while `a` and `b` do.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic and can produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is False.
