The value of `slength` is updated to the integer value of the input. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is the input integer, If `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `no` is True and `counter` is n. Otherwise, the state of `no` and `counter` remains unchanged, `i` is the value from the previous iteration plus 1**.
