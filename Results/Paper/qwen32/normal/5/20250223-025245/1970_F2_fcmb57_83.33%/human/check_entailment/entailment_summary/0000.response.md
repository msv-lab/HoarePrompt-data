Reasoning:

After carefully analyzing the provided Python program and its execution summary, there are several issues that need to be addressed to determine its correctness.

1. **Execution Summary Mismatch:**
   - The execution summary describes a function `func_1` that takes two parameters and returns a tuple where each element is the sum of the parameters. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` correctly adds the respective elements of two tuples representing coordinates, which is consistent with the problem's requirement for moving entities on the field.

2. **Logic Errors in the Main Program:**
   - **Catch Action (`C`):** The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is incorrect. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player to the Quaffle.
   - **Throw Action (`T`):** The program does not correctly handle the situation when a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal. It should check the team of the player and the goal before deciding the point winner.
   - **Bludger Elimination:** The program correctly identifies players who are eliminated by the Bludger, but it does not handle the case where multiple players could be eliminated at the same time in alphabetical order.
   - **Goal Scoring:** The program does not handle the scenario where the Quaffle is thrown into a goal correctly. It should reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, regardless of which team scored.

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - The program needs to ensure that all events (goals and eliminations) are printed in the correct order and format.
   - The final score should be printed in the correct format.

Given these issues, the program does not meet all the requirements of the problem description and does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
