Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to calculate the return value of the expression `x + dx, y + dy`.

From the initial state:
- `x` is equal to `a`, and `a` is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, with 3 <= `a` <= 99 and `a` is odd.
- `y` is equal to `a`, and `a` is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, with 3 <= `a` <= 99 and `a` is odd.
- `dx` is equal to `b`, and `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, with 3 <= `b` <= 99 and `b` is odd.
- `dy` is equal to `b`, and `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, with 3 <= `b` <= 99 and `b` is odd.

The expression to evaluate is `x + dx, y + dy`.

Since `x = a` and `dx = b`, the first part of the return value is `a + b`.
Since `y = a` and `dy = b`, the second part of the return value is `a + b`.

Therefore, the return value is `(a + b, a + b)`.

Given the constraints on `a` and `b` (both are odd integers between 3 and 99), the sum `a + b` will be an even integer between 6 and 198.

Output State: **The program returns (a + b, a + b) where a and b are odd integers between 3 and 99, making a + b an even integer between 6 and 198.**
