Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is `1`, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1. `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 2, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[1]`. Specifically, if the 2nd bit of `c` is `1`, then `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1. If the 2nd bit of `c` is `0`, then `pre[2][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[2][0]` is decremented by 1.**
