The given code snippet modifies the `suf` list by incrementing the second element of the sublist at index `j` by 1. Here's the impact on the variables:

- `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `j` is 1, and `suf[j][1]` is 0. After the increment, `suf[1][1]` becomes 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `i`, `cur`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except `suf[1][1]` which is 1, `i` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 1**.
