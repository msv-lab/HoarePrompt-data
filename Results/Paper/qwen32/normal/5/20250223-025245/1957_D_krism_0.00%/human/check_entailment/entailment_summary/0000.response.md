### Reasoning:

The provided code snippet has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The main loop in the program iterates `T` times, but the function `func_1` is called without any parameters and does not handle multiple test cases. Each call to `func_1` should process one test case and return the result for that test case, but the function does not return any value and instead prints intermediate results.

2. **Logic for Counting Tuples**: The logic in `func_1` for counting the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` is incorrect. The program attempts to use bit counts to derive the answer, but this approach does not correctly implement the required condition `f(x, y) âŠ• f(y, z) > f(x, z)`. The condition needs to be checked for all valid tuples `(x, y, z)` directly, or a more sophisticated method needs to be applied that correctly counts these tuples.

3. **Intermediate Print Statements**: The function includes print statements for debugging purposes, which should be removed in the final version of the program. These print statements do not contribute to the correctness of the output and can lead to incorrect results if the output is compared directly to expected results without these intermediate outputs.

4. **Return Value**: The function `func_1` should return the count of valid tuples, but it currently only prints the result. In a correct implementation, the result should be printed or returned appropriately for each test case.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program as provided is not correct for the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
