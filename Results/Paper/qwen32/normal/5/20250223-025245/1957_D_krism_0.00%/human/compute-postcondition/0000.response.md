The given initial state describes the context for a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. However, the Python code snippet provided is a simple print statement that does not depend on any of the variables or lists described in the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('-----------------')
```

This print statement will output a string of dashes (`-----------------`) regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or the contents of the list `a`.

Output: **-----------------**
