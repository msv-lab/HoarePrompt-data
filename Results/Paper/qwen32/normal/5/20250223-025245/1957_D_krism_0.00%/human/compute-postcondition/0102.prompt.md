Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `suf[j][1]` is the number of times the `j`-th bit was `1` across all `prefix[i]` values from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[1]`, and `suf[j][0]` is the number of times the `j`-th bit was `0` across all those values, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[1]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `suf[j][1]` is the number of times the `j`-th bit was `1` across all `prefix[i]` values from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[1]`, and `suf[j][0]` is the number of times the `j`-th bit was `0` across all those values, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 0, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[1]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is `1`, then `pre[j][1]` is set to 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is `1`, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1. `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 1, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is `1`, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1. `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 2, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[1]`. Specifically, if the 2nd bit of `c` is `1`, then `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1. If the 2nd bit of `c` is `0`, then `pre[2][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[2][0]` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
