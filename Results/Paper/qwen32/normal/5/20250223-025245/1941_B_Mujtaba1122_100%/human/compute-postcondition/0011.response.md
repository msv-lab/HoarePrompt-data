The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value at index `i` of the list by subtracting twice the value at index `i - 1` from it. The other elements of the list remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, where `list` is `[x > 0, 2, y - x - 4 > 0, ..., list[i + 1] - list[i - 1], ...]`, the value at index `i` will be updated. Specifically, the element at index `i` will now be `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`list` is `[x > 0, 2, y - x - 4 > 0, ..., list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1], ..., list[i + 1] - list[i - 1], ...]`**

In natural language: The output state is that the list remains the same except for the element at index `i`, which is now `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`. All other elements, including `x`, `y`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
