### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct or not.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using a specific operation.
- The operation can be performed any number of times and on any index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`).
- The operation modifies the array elements at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` as follows:
  - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
  - `a_i = a_i - 2`
  - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero.

#### `func_2(list, n)`:
- It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (since `i` must be between `2` and `n-1`).
- For each `i`, it enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
- Inside the loop, it performs the operation described in the problem, but incorrectly:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
- The correct operation should be:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
  - `list[i] -= 2`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
- After the loop, it checks if `list[i-1]` is not zero and prints 'no' if it is not.
- Finally, it checks if all elements are zero using `func_1` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Operation**: The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect. It should decrement each element by the fixed values (1, 2, 1) instead of multiplying by `list[i - 1]`.
2. **Logic Error**: The check `if list[i - 1] != 0` is misplaced and incorrect. It should not be used to determine the possibility of making the array zero.
3. **Output Handling**: The program prints 'no' and returns immediately if `list[i-1]` is not zero, which is not the correct approach to determine the possibility of making the entire array zero.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Specifically:
- The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect.
- The check `if list[i - 1] != 0` is misplaced and incorrect.
- The output handling is incorrect.

Since these issues directly affect the correctness of the program, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
