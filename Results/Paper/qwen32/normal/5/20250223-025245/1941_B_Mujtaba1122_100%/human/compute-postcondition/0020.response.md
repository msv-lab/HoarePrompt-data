The code snippet modifies the value at index `i + 1` of the list by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` from it. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, the value at index `i - 1` is `list[0]` which is 1, and the value at index `i + 1` is `list[2]` which is 1. After executing the code, `list[2]` will be `1 - 1 * 1 = 0`.

Output State: **The list is [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
