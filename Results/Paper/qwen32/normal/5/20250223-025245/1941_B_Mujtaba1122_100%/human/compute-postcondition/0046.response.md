The code snippet modifies the value at index `i + 1` of the list by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` from it. Given that `i` is 2, the value at index 1 (`list[i - 1]`) is 1, and the value at index 3 (`list[i + 1]`) is 1. Therefore, the value at index 3 will be updated to `1 - 1`, which is 0.

Output State: **The list is `[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3.**
