Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Operation Logic Error**:
   - In the `func_2` function, the operation logic is incorrect. The operation is supposed to decrement `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1. However, the code incorrectly modifies these values by multiplying them with `list[i - 1]`.
   - Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     ```

2. **Early Termination**:
   - The code checks if `list[i - 1] != 0` after processing each index `i` and prints 'no' if it is not zero. This is incorrect because the operation can be applied multiple times to different indices, and a non-zero value at `list[i - 1]` might be reduced to zero in subsequent operations.
   - The check `if list[i - 1] != 0:` should be removed or moved to a more appropriate place in the logic.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The final check to see if all elements are zero should be done after all possible operations have been applied. The current implementation does not ensure that all elements are zero after processing the array.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The correct sequence of operations would be:
1. Apply the operation at `i=3` to get `[1, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
2. Apply the operation at `i=3` again to get `[1, 3, 1, 1, 2]`.
3. Apply the operation at `i=2` to get `[0, 1, 0, 1, 2]`.
4. Apply the operation at `i=3` to get `[0, 1, -1, -1, 2]` (which is invalid as values cannot be negative).
5. Apply the operation at `i=2` again to get `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

However, the provided code would incorrectly terminate early because it checks `list[i - 1]` after each operation, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Code Example:
Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def can_make_all_zero(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < 3:
        return "NO" if any(arr) else "YES"
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] > 1 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
    
    return "YES" if all(x == 0 for x in arr) else "NO"

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(can_make_all_zero(arr))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected code properly applies the operations and checks if all elements can be made zero.
