In the given for loop, the loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1)`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, n - 1)` contains at least one integer. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute, implying that `n` must be greater than `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` equals the length of the list.

The initial state already satisfies the condition `n >= 3`, so no adjustment is needed for `n` or the list itself. The variable `i` is part of the loop head, but its initial value is determined by the range function and does not need to be set before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop can execute.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` equals the length of the list**
