Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'yes', 'no']`. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even, `results` is `['no', 'no', 'no']`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `results` now includes an additional element `'no'`, making it either `['yes', 'yes', 'no']` or `['no', 'no', 'no']` depending on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even. All other variables remain unchanged.
