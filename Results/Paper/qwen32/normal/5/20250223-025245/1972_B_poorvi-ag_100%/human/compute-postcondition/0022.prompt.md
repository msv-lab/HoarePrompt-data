Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is an input string. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes']`. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is even, `results` is `['no']`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'yes']`. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even, `results` is `['no', 'no']`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'yes', 'yes']` if `arr.count('U') % 2 == 1` and `['yes', 'yes', 'no']` otherwise. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even, `results` is `['no', 'no', 'yes']` if `arr.count('U') % 2 == 1` and `['no', 'no', 'no']` otherwise. However, since the condition `arr.count('U') % 2 == 1` directly corresponds to the count of 'U' being odd, the final simplified postcondition is: if the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'yes', 'yes']`; if the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even, `results` is `['no', 'no', 'no']`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
