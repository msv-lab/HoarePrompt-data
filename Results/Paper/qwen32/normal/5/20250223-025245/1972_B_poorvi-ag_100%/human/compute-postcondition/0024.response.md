The given initial state specifies that there is a list named `results` which contains at least one element, and that element is either 'yes' or 'no'. However, the print statement in the code snippet is `print(i)`. The variable `i` is not mentioned or defined in the initial state provided.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we do not have enough information to determine its value. Therefore, attempting to print `i` would result in a `NameError` because `i` is not recognized in the current scope.

However, if we assume that `i` is supposed to be an index or some value related to the `results` list (as it's a common practice to use indices when dealing with lists), we would need additional information to determine its value.

Given the information provided, the most precise description we can give is that the variable `i` is not defined, leading to an error. But since the task asks for what will be printed and we need to follow the format, we will state that the output cannot be determined due to the undefined variable.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
