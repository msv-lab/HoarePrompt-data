You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string of "U" and "D" characters representing coins facing up or down. It determines if the number of "U" characters in each string is odd and returns "yes" for odd counts and "no" for even counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Determine the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing facing-up coins and flipping adjacent coins.
- **Winning Condition**: The player who forces the opponent to face a situation with no facing-up coins wins.
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with the number of coins and a string representing their positions (U for up, D for down).
- **Output**: "YES" if Alice wins, "NO" if Bob wins.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it counts the number of facing-up coins ('U') and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even:
- If the count of 'U' is odd, Alice wins (`results.append('yes')`).
- If the count of 'U' is even, Bob wins (`results.append('no')`).

### Correctness Verification
The key insight here is whether the number of facing-up coins ('U') being odd or even determines the winner. This can be derived from the optimal strategy analysis in such games:
- **Odd 'U'**: Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of 'U's for Bob, forcing Bob into a losing position if both play optimally.
- **Even 'U'**: Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of 'U's for Alice, forcing Alice into a losing position if both play optimally.

Given this understanding, the program's logic seems correct as it correctly identifies the winner based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for all potential cases. There is no identified edge case where the program does not work as expected.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.
