The code snippet appends the string 'yes' to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `results` is `['yes']`, `arr` is an input string. The count of 'U' in `arr` is odd.**
