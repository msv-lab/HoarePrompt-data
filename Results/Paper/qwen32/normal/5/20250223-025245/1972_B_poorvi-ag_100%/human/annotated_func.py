#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the respective input string is odd or even.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing all the elements that have been processed, with each element being either 'yes' or 'no', representing whether the count of 'U' in the respective input string is odd or even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string of "U" and "D" characters representing coins facing up or down. It determines if the number of "U" characters in each string is odd and returns "yes" for odd counts and "no" for even counts.
