To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements, which are either 'yes' or 'no'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The initial state only provides information about the `results` list and does not mention any variable `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it is not possible to determine its value based on the given information. Therefore, the variable `i` is undefined in this context.

### Conclusion:
Without a definition for `i`, it's impossible to determine what will be printed. If `i` were defined elsewhere in the code that is not shown, we would need that information to determine the output. Based on the provided information, the variable `i` is not defined.

### Output:
Since `i` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError`. However, the task asks for the output based on the given precondition, and since `i` is not defined, we can only state that the output will be an error due to the undefined variable.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
