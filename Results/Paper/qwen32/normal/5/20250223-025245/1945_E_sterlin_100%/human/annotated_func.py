#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and is expected to return an integer.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer that is provided as input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature, hence no precondition can be derived from it.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers, which are the elements of the input string split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes no input parameters and returns a map object containing integers. These integers are obtained by splitting an input string by whitespace and converting each split element to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3()`, which is designed to read a line of input and return a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as a line of input, where each integer is separated by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, expecting integers separated by whitespace, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature, thus no precondition can be derived from it.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_5` does not take any parameters and returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated values read from the input.
def func_5():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated values read from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into space-separated values, and returns these values as a list of strings.
