### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2()` reads each test case's `n` and `x`.
   - `func_3()` reads the permutation `p` for each test case.

2. **Logic to Solve the Problem**:
   - The program initializes a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index.
   - It also initializes a `seen` list to keep track of which elements have been encountered during the binary search.
   - The binary search is performed with `left` starting at 0 and `right` starting at `n`.
   - If `p[left]` equals `x` after the binary search, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` has not been seen during the binary search, one swap is needed to bring `x` to the position where `p[left]` ends up being.
   - If `x` has been seen, two swaps are needed to bring `x` to a position that hasn't been seen and then to the position where `p[left]` ends up being.

3. **Output**:
   - The number of swaps (`k`) is printed.
   - If swaps are needed, the indices of the elements to be swapped are printed.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Input Handling**:
  - `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` correctly handle the input according to the problem description.

- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic to determine the number of swaps and the indices to swap is correct.
  - The binary search is implemented correctly.
  - The `seen` list ensures that we correctly identify if `x` has been encountered during the binary search.
  - The conditions for the number of swaps are correctly implemented based on the problem's requirements.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles cases where `x` is already at the correct position (`p[left] == x`).
  - It handles cases where `x` is not seen during the binary search.
  - It handles cases where `x` is seen during the binary search.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles all necessary cases and outputs the results as expected.

**Correctness: True**
