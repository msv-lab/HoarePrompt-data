Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. The code only includes input reading functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`), but it does not contain any logic to perform the required operations (swapping elements and performing binary search). Therefore, this code is incomplete and does not meet the problem description.
