### Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem by using a modified binary search approach on a permutation array. The main steps of the program are as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the number `x` to be found.
2. **Permutation Reading**: It then reads the permutation array `p`.
3. **Index Mapping**: A dictionary `num_indx` is created to map each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).
4. **Binary Search Simulation**: The program simulates a binary search on the permutation array `p` to find the position `left` where the binary search would stop.
5. **Check and Output**:
   - If the element at the position `left` is equal to `x`, it means no swaps are needed (`k = 0`).
   - If the element `x` is not seen during the binary search, it means `x` is not in the positions checked by the binary search, and only one swap is needed to bring `x` to the correct position.
   - If the element `x` is seen but not at the position `left`, it means two swaps are needed: one to bring an unseen element to `left`, and another to bring `x` to the correct position.

The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are responsible for reading the input correctly, and the main logic of the program is implemented in the loop that processes each test case. The provided execution summaries confirm that these functions work as expected.

### Correctness:
Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the solution appears to be correct. It correctly handles the binary search simulation and determines the minimum number of swaps needed to ensure that after the binary search, the element at position `left` is equal to `x`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
