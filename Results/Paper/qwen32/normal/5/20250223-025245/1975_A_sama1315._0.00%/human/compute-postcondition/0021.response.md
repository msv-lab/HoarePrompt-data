The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` to the integer value of the string located at `data[index]`. Given that `index` is `3 + 2n`, the value of `n` at this point is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`.

Since `n` is being reassigned, we need to reflect this change in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value twice; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
