You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n positive integers, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. Each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50. Each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6. The list `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, meaning there exists at least one index `i` such that `arr[i]` > `arr[i + 1]`.
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the input list `arr` of positive integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1

        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `arr` is the last list of integers processed, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_1, n_2, ..., n_t)`, `t` is `0`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each of the `t` iterations.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: (an empty string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it computes a result using the `func_1` function and prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations. Each operation consists of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these two parts. The key insight is that the only way to sort the array using this operation is if the array is already sorted or if it can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix and the prefix is greater than or equal to the suffix when reversed.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(arr)**: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns "Yes". If there is any element that is greater than the next element, it returns "No". However, it also has an else clause that checks if the array is sorted in non-increasing order, which is incorrect for this problem. The else clause should not exist because the array could still be unsortable even if it is not sorted in non-increasing order.
2. **func_2()**: This function reads the input, processes each test case using the `func_1` function, and prints the results.

### Issues in the Program:
- The `func_1` function incorrectly checks if the array is sorted in non-increasing order and returns "Yes" in that case. This is not a valid condition for the problem as the array needs to be sorted in non-decreasing order after some operations, not necessarily non-increasing.
- The program does not handle the scenario where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix can be moved to the front to sort the array. The function `func_1` does not implement this logic.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operations. The function `func_1` incorrectly checks for non-increasing order and does not handle the logic for splitting and swapping parts of the array.

### Correctness: **False**
