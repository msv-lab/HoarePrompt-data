The provided code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the built-in `input` function to the `sys.stdin.read` method. This change affects how input can be read from standard input in the subsequent code. However, since there is no further code provided to utilize this reassignment, the list `arr` and its properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `input` is now `sys.stdin.read`.**

In natural language: The list `arr` retains its initial state of being a list of n positive integers, with each integer ranging from 1 to 1,000,000, and the length of the list being between 2 and 50. The built-in `input` function is now replaced with `sys.stdin.read`.
