The code appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. Therefore, `results` will no longer be an empty list but will contain the `result` value.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

In simple terms: The `results` list now contains the `result` value, while all other variables retain their previous values.
