Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The problem asks if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps. The provided solution consists of two functions:

1. **func_1(arr)**: This function checks if the array can be sorted by performing prefix-suffix swaps.
2. **func_2()**: This function handles the input reading and output generation for multiple test cases.

### Function `func_1(arr)`

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'
```

- **Logic Explanation**:
  - The function first checks if the array is already non-decreasing using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`. If true, it returns `'Yes'`.
  - If the array is not non-decreasing, it checks if there are any elements that are out of order using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`. If true, it returns `'No'`.
  - If the array is not non-decreasing but there are no elements out of order (which is logically impossible), it returns `'Yes'`.

### Function `func_2()`

```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

- **Logic Explanation**:
  - The function reads all the input data at once and processes it.
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then the array elements.
  - It calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted and appends the result to the `results` list.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Evaluation

#### Function `func_1(arr)`

The logic in `func_1(arr)` is flawed. It only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any elements out of order. However, the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing prefix-suffix swaps, which is not what the function does.

#### Example Case

Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The function `func_1([3, 1, 2])` will return `'No'` because `3 > 1`.
- However, by performing a prefix-suffix swap, we can make the array `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

#### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps. It only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any elements out of order, which is insufficient.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by performing prefix-suffix swaps. It only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any elements out of order, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
