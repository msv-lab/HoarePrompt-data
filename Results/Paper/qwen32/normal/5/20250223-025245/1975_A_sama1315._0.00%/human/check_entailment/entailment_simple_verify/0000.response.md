### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the `func_1` function. The function only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any elements out of order, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by performing prefix-suffix swaps. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues and the logic needed to solve the problem correctly:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps.
   - A prefix-suffix swap involves splitting the array into two parts (`x` and `y`) and swapping their positions (`a := y + x`).

2. **Current Implementation Flaw**:
   - The `func_1` function checks if the array is already sorted using `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if there are any elements out of order using `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
   - The function does not attempt to determine if the array can be sorted by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine if the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps, we need to check if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that concatenating the suffix and the prefix results in a sorted array.
   - This involves finding a point `i` such that the subarray `arr[i:]` followed by `arr[:i]` is sorted.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
     - The function `func_1([3, 1, 2])` returns `'No'` because `3 > 1`.
     - However, by performing a prefix-suffix swap with `x = [3]` and `y = [1, 2]`, we can make the array `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.
   - This example demonstrates that the current implementation is incorrect.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to iterate over all possible split points and check if the resulting concatenated array is sorted.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the critical flaw identified in the `func_1` function and the need for a more comprehensive approach to determine if the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The provided program is incorrect as it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by performing prefix-suffix swaps.
