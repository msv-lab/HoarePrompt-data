Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is the last list of integers processed.
- `data` is unchanged (though not used in the print statement).
- `index` is calculated as `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_1, n_2, ..., n_t)`, where `t` is `0`.
- `t` is `0`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each of the `t` iterations.

### Analysis:
- Since `t` is `0`, the formula for `index` simplifies to `1 + 2 * 0 + sum()` which is `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`. However, this value of `index` is not used in the print statement.
- `results` is a list that contains the results of `func_1(arr)` for each of the `t` iterations. Since `t` is `0`, there are no iterations, and thus `results` is an empty list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

- The `'\n'.join(results)` expression joins all elements in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`). Since `results` is an empty list, joining it results in an empty string.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output an empty string because `results` is an empty list.

Output: **(an empty string)**
