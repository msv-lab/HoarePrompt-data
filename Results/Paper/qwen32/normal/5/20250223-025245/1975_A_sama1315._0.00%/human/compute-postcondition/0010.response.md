The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `2 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
