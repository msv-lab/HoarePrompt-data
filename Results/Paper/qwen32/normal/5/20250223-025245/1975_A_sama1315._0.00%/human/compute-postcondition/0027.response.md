To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the pattern of how the variables evolve with each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

- **Initial State:**
  - `arr` is a list of n positive integers.
  - `data` is a list of strings.
  - `index` is 1.
  - `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
  - `results` is an empty list.

- **After each iteration:**
  - `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`.
  - `index` is incremented by 1.
  - `arr` is set to a list of integers derived from the slice `data[index:index + n]`.
  - `index` is incremented by `n`.
  - `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`.
  - `results` appends `result`.

- **After `t` iterations:**
  - The loop will have executed `t` times, meaning `t` different `arr` lists will have been processed.
  - `index` will have been incremented by `1` for each `n` and each `data[index]` read, resulting in a final value of `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_1, n_2, ..., n_t)`, where `n_i` is the length of the `i-th` array.
  - `t` will be `0` because the loop runs `t` times and `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
  - `results` will contain the results of `func_1(arr)` for each of the `t` iterations.

Given the initial state and the pattern of change, the final state of the variables is:

- `arr` will be the last list of integers processed in the last iteration.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `index` will be `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_1, n_2, ..., n_t)`.
- `t` will be `0`.
- `results` will be a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each of the `t` iterations.

Output State: **`arr` is the last list of integers processed, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_1, n_2, ..., n_t)`, `t` is `0`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each of the `t` iterations.**
