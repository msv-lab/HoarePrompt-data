Reasoning: 
The provided program is made up of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function checks whether a given array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and returns 'Yes' if it is, and 'No' otherwise. However, the problem requires us to determine if the array can be sorted by performing a prefix-suffix swap operation any number of times. 

The `func_1` function does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through the described swap operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted. Therefore, the `func_1` function is insufficient to solve the problem as described. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and applies `func_1` to each test case, but since `func_1` is not correctly implemented for the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should determine if the array can be split into two parts such that swapping these parts results in a sorted array. This would involve more complex logic than simply checking if the array is sorted.

Correctness: **False**
