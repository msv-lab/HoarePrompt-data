### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The provided code defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to solve this problem.

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If the array is not sorted, the function checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element. If such an element exists, it returns `'No'`. However, there's a logical error here. The function should not return `'Yes'` if it finds any element greater than the next one because the array might still be sortable by splitting and swapping. Instead, it should determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by a single split and swap operation or a series of such operations.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly address the problem's requirement. It simply checks if the array is sorted or not and doesn't consider the possibility of sorting through splitting and swapping.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input data, processes each test case using `func_1`, and collects the results.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:

The given code is incorrect because `func_1` does not properly determine if the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient. The problem requires checking if the array can be split and swapped to achieve a sorted order.

### Correctness: **False**
