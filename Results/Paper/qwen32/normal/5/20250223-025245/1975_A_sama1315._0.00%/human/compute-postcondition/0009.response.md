The code snippet converts a slice of the `data` list starting from the `index` position and spanning `n` elements into integers, and assigns this list to `arr`. 

Given that `index` is 2 and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, the slice `data[index:index + n]` will be converted to integers and stored in `arr`. 

The other variables (`data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
