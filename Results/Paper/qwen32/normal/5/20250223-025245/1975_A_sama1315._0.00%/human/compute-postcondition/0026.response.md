The code snippet provided is `results.append(result)`. This line appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. 

Given the initial state, `results` is already a list containing the return value of `func_1(arr)` twice. After executing the line `results.append(result)`, `results` will now contain the return value of `func_1(arr)` three times.

The other variables (`arr`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `n`, and `result`) remain unchanged by this line of code.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from the slice `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 3n + 1]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 3n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(arr)` three times; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
