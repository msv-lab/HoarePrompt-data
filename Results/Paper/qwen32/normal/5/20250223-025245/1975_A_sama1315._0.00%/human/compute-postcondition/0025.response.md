The code snippet `result = func_1(arr)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `arr` and assigns its return value to the variable `result`. Since the return value of `func_1` is not specified, we'll denote it as the result of the function call. The variable `result` is already mentioned in the initial state and is part of the `results` list, which contains the `result` value twice. After the function call, the value of `result` will be updated to the new return value of `func_1(arr)`, and since `results` contains `result` twice, it will reflect the new value of `result`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from the slice `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 3n + 1]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 3n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(arr)` twice; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
