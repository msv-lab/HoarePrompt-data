The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's continuation. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1, and the loop iterates `t` times, we need to adjust `t` to reflect the remaining iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. We need to adjust `t` to be one less than its current value.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value twice; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**
