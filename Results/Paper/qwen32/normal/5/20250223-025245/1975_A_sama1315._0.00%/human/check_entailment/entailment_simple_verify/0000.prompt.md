You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The problem asks if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps. The provided solution consists of two functions:

1. **func_1(arr)**: This function checks if the array can be sorted by performing prefix-suffix swaps.
2. **func_2()**: This function handles the input reading and output generation for multiple test cases.

### Function `func_1(arr)`

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'
```

- **Logic Explanation**:
  - The function first checks if the array is already non-decreasing using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`. If true, it returns `'Yes'`.
  - If the array is not non-decreasing, it checks if there are any elements that are out of order using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`. If true, it returns `'No'`.
  - If the array is not non-decreasing but there are no elements out of order (which is logically impossible), it returns `'Yes'`.

### Function `func_2()`

```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

- **Logic Explanation**:
  - The function reads all the input data at once and processes it.
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then the array elements.
  - It calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted and appends the result to the `results` list.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Evaluation

#### Function `func_1(arr)`

The logic in `func_1(arr)` is flawed. It only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any elements out of order. However, the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing prefix-suffix swaps, which is not what the function does.

#### Example Case

Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The function `func_1([3, 1, 2])` will return `'No'` because `3 > 1`.
- However, by performing a prefix-suffix swap, we can make the array `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

#### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps. It only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any elements out of order, which is insufficient.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by performing prefix-suffix swaps. It only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any elements out of order, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
