To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions leading up to the print statement.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Input**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `q` is an integer such that \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) (decremented by 1).
   - `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
   - For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\).
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\).
   - `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l` to `r` in the `nums` list, calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is evaluated.
   - If this condition is true, the if part is executed.
   - If this condition is false, the else part is executed, which contains `print('NO')`.

Since the `print('NO')` statement is in the else part, it will be executed if the condition is false.

Given that the exact values of `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact boolean value of the condition. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement `print('NO')` will execute if the condition is false.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
