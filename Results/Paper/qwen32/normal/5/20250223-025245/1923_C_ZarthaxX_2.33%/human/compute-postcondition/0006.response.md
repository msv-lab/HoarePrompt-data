The code snippet provided updates the `sum` list based on the values in the `nums` list. Specifically, for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, it updates `sum[i]` to be the value of `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]` minus 1.

Given the initial state, the `sum` list is initially a list of `n + 1` integers, all set to 0. After the execution of the provided code snippet, the `sum` list will be updated such that each element `sum[i]` reflects the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to `nums[i-1]`, with each element in `nums` decremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**
