The given code snippet updates the `ones` list at index `i` based on the value of `nums[i - 1]`. Specifically, it increments `ones[i]` by 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise, it remains the same as `ones[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state, `i` is `n`, so the code updates `ones[n]` based on `nums[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` and `ones[n]` is updated to `ones[n - 1] + (1 if nums[n - 1] == 1 else 0)`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `i` is `n`.**
