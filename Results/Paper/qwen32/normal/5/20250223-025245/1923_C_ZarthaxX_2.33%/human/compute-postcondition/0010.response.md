The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the for loop statement `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, the loop initializes `i` to 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to set `i` to the next value in the sequence, which is `1` (since the loop starts from `1`).

However, since the loop has just finished the iteration with `i = n`, the next logical step is to start the loop from `1` again if we are considering a fresh start of the loop. But if we are considering the immediate next state after the loop has finished, `i` would be `n + 1`, which would terminate the loop.

Given the task is to understand the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, and the loop has just finished with `i = n`, the next state for `i` should be `1` if we are resetting the loop, but if we are considering the immediate next state, `i` would be `n + 1`.

Since the task specifies to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head for the next iteration, and the loop has just finished with `i = n`, the immediate next state for `i` would be `n + 1`, which would terminate the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (considering the loop has just finished) would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` and `ones[n]` is updated to `ones[n - 1] + (1 if nums[n - 1] == 1 else 0)`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `sum[n]` is updated to `sum[n - 1] + nums[n - 1] - 1`; `i` is `n + 1`**
