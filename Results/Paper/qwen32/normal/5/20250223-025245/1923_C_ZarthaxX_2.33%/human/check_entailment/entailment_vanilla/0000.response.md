Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem defines a subarray as "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in `a` (the subarray) equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` is positive.

Given a subarray `c[l...r]`, we need to check if it can be transformed into such a "good" array `b`.

### Key Observations

1. **Sum Condition**: Since `b` must have the same sum as `a` and all elements in `b` must be positive, the sum of `a` must be at least `r - l + 1` (the length of the subarray). This is because the smallest possible sum of `r - l + 1` positive integers is `1 + 1 + ... + 1` (r - l + 1 times).

2. **Difference Condition**: For each element in `a`, the corresponding element in `b` must be different. If an element in `a` is `1`, the only positive integer we can choose for `b` that is different from `1` is at least `2`. Therefore, if the subarray `a` contains `k` ones, the sum of `b` must be at least `k * 2 + (r - l + 1 - k) = k + (r - l + 1)`. This is because we replace each `1` with `2` and each other element with at least `1`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses prefix sums to efficiently compute the number of `1`s and the sum minus the number of elements in any subarray `c[l...r]`.

1. **Prefix Array `ones`**: This array keeps track of the number of `1`s up to each index in the subarray.
2. **Prefix Array `sum`**: This array keeps track of the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements up to each index. This effectively captures the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements, which is useful for checking the conditions.

For each query, the solution calculates:
- `onesInRange`: The number of `1`s in the subarray `c[l...r]`.
- `sumInRange`: The sum of the subarray `c[l...r]` minus the number of elements in this subarray.

The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` checks if the sum of `b` can be equal to the sum of `a` while satisfying the conditions:
- `2 * onesInRange`: This represents the minimum sum contribution of the `1`s in `a` when they are replaced with `2`s.
- `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange`: This represents the minimum sum contribution of the remaining elements in `a` when they are replaced with `1`s.

If this condition holds, the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array `b`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently checks the conditions for each subarray using prefix sums, and it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good". Therefore, the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
