The only variable in the loop head of the given `for` loop is `i`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by making sure that `n` is at least `1` so that the range `(1, n + 1)` is valid and contains at least one value.

Let's analyze the provided state and determine what needs to be adjusted:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. This variable is part of the loop head and needs to be at least `1` for the loop to execute.
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5. This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9. This list is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`. These variables are not part of the loop head and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input. This list is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0. This list is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0. This list is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

The loop will execute if `n` is at least `1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set to a value within the valid range, which is already satisfied by the given condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `i` is 1.** 

Since `n` is already guaranteed to be at least `1` by the problem statement, no further adjustment is needed for `n`. The initial value of `i` in the loop head is `1` as specified in the `range(1, n + 1)`.
