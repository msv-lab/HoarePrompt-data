Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `c` contains `n` integers where each element `c_i` is between 1 and 10^9. For each query, it accepts two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The function processes these inputs and returns the result of each query, which is not specified in the given output description.**
