Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 0 < `q` ≤ 3 · 10^5 (decremented by 1); `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`; `i` is `n + 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `sumInRange` has been calculated and assigned the value `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
