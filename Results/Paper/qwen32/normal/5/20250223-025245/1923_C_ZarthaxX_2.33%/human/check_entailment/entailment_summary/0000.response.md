### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided solution correctly identifies whether a subarray is "good" as defined in the problem statement.

The program uses two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to precompute values that help in answering each query efficiently:

1. **Array `ones`**: This array keeps a running total of the number of 1s encountered up to each index in the input array `nums`. This allows the program to quickly determine the number of 1s in any subarray by subtracting the appropriate values from `ones`.

2. **Array `sum`**: This array keeps a running total of the sum of the elements in `nums` minus 1 for each index. This adjustment is made because the problem requires `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i` for every index `i`. By subtracting 1 from each element, the program can later check if the adjusted sum of the subarray is sufficient to accommodate a different array `b` with positive elements that are not equal to the elements of `a`.

For each query, the program calculates:
- `onesInRange`: The number of 1s in the subarray.
- `sumInRange`: The sum of the elements in the subarray minus the number of 1s (since each 1 was subtracted when computing the `sum` array).

The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is derived to determine if there exists a valid array `b` that meets the criteria:
- `2 * onesInRange - onesInRange` accounts for the fact that each 1 in the subarray must be increased to at least 2 in `b` to ensure `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`.
- `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the remaining elements in the subarray that need to be increased to ensure they are not equal to their corresponding elements in `a` and are still positive.

If the adjusted sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`) is sufficient to accommodate these requirements, the program outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
