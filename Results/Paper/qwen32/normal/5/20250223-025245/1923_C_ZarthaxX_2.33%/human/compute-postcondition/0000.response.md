The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. Given the initial state, these variables were not defined, and now they are assigned specific values based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
