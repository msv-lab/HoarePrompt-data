The code snippet provided updates the `ones` list at index `i` based on the value of `nums[i - 1]`. Specifically, it increments `ones[i]` by 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as `ones[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n
- `i` is `n + 1`

The code line:
```
ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
```
updates `ones[i]` to be the cumulative count of 1s up to `nums[i - 1]`.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, the statement updates `ones[n + 1]` to be the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[n - 1]`, which is essentially `ones[n]`.

Thus, the value of `ones[n]` remains unchanged, and `ones[n + 1]` is set to the same value as `ones[n]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` and `ones[n + 1]` is equal to `ones[n]`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `i` is `n + 1`.**
