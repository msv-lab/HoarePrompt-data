The code snippet provided increments the value of `counter` by 1. Given the initial state, `counter` is either 0 or 1. After the increment, if `counter` was 0, it will become 1, and if it was 1, it will become 2. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, `counter` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is `len(num) - 2`.**
