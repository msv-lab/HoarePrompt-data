The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters, so we can only adjust `i` for the next iteration. According to the code, the loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0` in reverse order. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, `counter` is 1 if the current value of `num[i]` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 0, and `i` is `len(num) - 2`**
