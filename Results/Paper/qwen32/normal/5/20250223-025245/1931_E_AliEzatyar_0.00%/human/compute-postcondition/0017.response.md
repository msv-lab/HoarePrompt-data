Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `t` and `t` pairs of lists. Each pair includes a list with two integers `[n, m]` and a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`. The function returns `counter`, which is the number of consecutive '0' elements from the end of the list `num` until a non-'0' element is encountered or the list is exhausted.**
