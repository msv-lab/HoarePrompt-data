Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 1; `j` is `n - 1`.**

In simple terms, the list `arr` remains the same, with the condition that the first two elements are equal and all elements are within the range from 1 to `n`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The variable `j` remains unchanged at `n - 1`.
