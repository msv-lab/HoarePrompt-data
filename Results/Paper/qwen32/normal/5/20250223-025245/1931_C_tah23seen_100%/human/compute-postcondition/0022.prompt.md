You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and n is the length of the list arr. The function is called once for each test case, and the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. There are t test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal (where `k` is the number of times the loop executed), and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, `i` is `k`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal, `i` is `k`, `j` is `0`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal, `i` is `k`, `j` is `0`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= n, and n is the length of the list `arr`. Regardless of the input, the function always returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
