You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by applying at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a specific value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each test case. Here's the breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `i` is set to 0, representing the start of the array.
   - `j` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, representing the end of the array.

2. **Finding the First Change:**
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` as long as the current element is the same as the next element. This effectively finds the first index where the sequence of identical elements ends.

3. **Finding the Last Change:**
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` as long as the current element is the same as the previous element. This finds the last index where the sequence of identical elements starts from the end.

4. **Checking if the Array is Already Uniform:**
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the array is already uniform or has the same start and end elements. In this case, the cost is the length of the middle segment that needs to be changed, which is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - If the array is not uniform, the cost is the minimum of changing the segment from the start to `j` or from `i` to the end, which is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided program seems to be attempting to find the minimum cost based on the idea of changing the least number of elements to make the array uniform. However, there are some issues with the logic:

- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where the array has multiple segments of different values correctly. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the correct minimum cost is 4, but the program might not compute this correctly due to the way it calculates `i` and `j`.

- **Logic Flaws:** The logic for calculating `i` and `j` does not account for the possibility of multiple segments of different values that might need to be changed. The program only considers the first and last segments and their transitions, which is insufficient for all cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the logic flaws and the fact that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
