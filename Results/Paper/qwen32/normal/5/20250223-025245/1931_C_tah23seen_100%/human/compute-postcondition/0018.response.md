Given the initial state, `i` is `k`, which means `i` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the first `k` elements in the list `arr`. Since the first `k` elements are all equal and `i` is `k`, it implies that `i` points to the element right after the initial sequence of `k` equal elements. `j` is `0`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.

The expression `max(j - i - 1, 0)` is evaluated as follows:
- `j` is `0`.
- `i` is `k`, which is the number of initial equal elements.
- Therefore, `j - i - 1` translates to `0 - k - 1`, which simplifies to `-k - 1`.

Since `k` is a positive integer (as it represents a count of elements), `-k - 1` is always a negative number. The `max` function will then return `0` because `0` is greater than any negative number.

Output State: **The program returns 0**.
