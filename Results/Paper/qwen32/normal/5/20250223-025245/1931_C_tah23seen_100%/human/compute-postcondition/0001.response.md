The code snippet `n = len(arr)` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the list `arr`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is already the length of the list `arr`, executing this line does not change the value of `n`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0.**
