Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The function seems to have a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements and logic. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and First While Loop:**
   - The first while loop increments `i` until it finds a change in the array's values. This loop identifies the length of the initial segment of the array where all elements are the same.

2. **Second While Loop:**
   - The second while loop decrements `j` until it finds a change in the array's values. This loop identifies the length of the final segment of the array where all elements are the same.

3. **Comparison and Return Statement:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, the function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This logic seems incorrect because it doesn't consider the cost to change the middle segment if it exists.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This logic also seems incorrect because it doesn't consider the cost to change the middle segment or the segments at the ends.

**Key Issues:**
- The function does not consider the cost to change the middle segment of the array if it exists.
- The function does not correctly calculate the cost to change the array to a single value optimally.
- The function always returns a value based on the first and last segments without considering the optimal segment to change.

**Correct Approach:**
- To solve the problem correctly, one should consider all possible values in the array and calculate the cost to change the entire array to each of these values. The minimum cost among these calculations will be the answer.
- A more efficient approach would involve using a frequency count and considering the segments of the array that need to be changed.

**Conclusion:**
Given the above analysis, the provided function is incorrect as it does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
