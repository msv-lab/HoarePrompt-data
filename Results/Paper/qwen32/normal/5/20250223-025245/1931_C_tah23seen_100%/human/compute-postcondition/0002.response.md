The code assigns the variable `j` the value of `len(arr) - 1`. Given that `arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, `len(arr)` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `j` is assigned the value `n - 1`.

The variables `arr` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`, is still valid. The variable `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`.**
