To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal.
- `i` is `k`.
- `j` is `n - 2`.
- `n` must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `j > 0` must be true.
2. `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must be true.

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition `j > 0`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `n` must be at least 2, `n - 2` can be 0 when `n` is 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure that `j` is greater than 0.

2. **Condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`:**
   - The condition requires that the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in the list `arr` must be equal.
   - Given that the first `k` elements are all equal, and `i` is `k`, we know that the first `k` elements are identical.
   - To ensure `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`, `j` and `j - 1` must be within the range where the elements are known to be equal. Since `j` is `n - 2`, we need to ensure that `n - 2` and `n - 3` are within the range of the first `k` elements, i.e., `k` must be at least `n - 1`.

Combining these conditions, we need:
- `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure `j > 0`.
- `k` must be at least `n - 1` to ensure `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal, `i` is `k`, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `k` must be at least `n - 1`**.
