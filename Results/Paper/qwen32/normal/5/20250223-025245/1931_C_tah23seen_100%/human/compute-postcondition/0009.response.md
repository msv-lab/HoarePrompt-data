Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal (where `k` is the number of times the loop executed), and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, `i` is `k`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the list `arr` will have the first `k` elements all being the same, where `k` is the number of times the loop executed. The variable `i` will be equal to `k`, and `j` will remain `n - 1` where `n` is the length of the list `arr`. All other elements in the list (if any) after the first `k` elements can be any integers between 1 and `n` inclusive.
