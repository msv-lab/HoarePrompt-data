The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a` after the currently processed `num`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the next integer in the list `a` after the previously processed one. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next integer in the list `a` after the current `num`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `num` is the next integer in the list `a` after the current `num`.**
