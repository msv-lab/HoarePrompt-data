Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get. The program only counts the number of pairs of cards you have and assumes that you can always play optimally to maximize your score based solely on the number of pairs. However, the problem requires considering Nene's optimal play, which can affect the outcome.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Nene's Optimal Play:** Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means she will try to play cards that either:
   - Do not allow you to score points (if she can).
   - Maximize her points without affecting your score negatively.

2. **Turn Order and Strategy:** The order of turns and the strategy used by Nene can significantly impact the game's outcome. The program does not account for these factors.

3. **Dynamic Interaction:** The game is dynamic, and the outcome depends on the sequence of moves. The program does not simulate the game or consider the interaction between your moves and Nene's optimal responses.

A correct solution would involve simulating the game or using a more sophisticated strategy that takes into account the optimal play by both players. The given program only counts the number of pairs you have, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum score you can achieve given Nene's optimal play.
