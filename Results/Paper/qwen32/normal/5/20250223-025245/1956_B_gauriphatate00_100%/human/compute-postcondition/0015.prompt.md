Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `count_a` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num in count_a:
        count_a[num] += 1
    else:
        count_a[num] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is an integer. If `num` was originally a key in the dictionary `count_a`, then `count_a[num]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_a` is updated to have a single key-value pair `{num: 1}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `num` is the next integer in the list `a` after the previously processed one. If `num` is already in `count_a`, `count_a[num]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_a[num]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `num` is the next integer in the list `a` after the current `num`. If `num` was already in `count_a`, then `count_a[num]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_a[num]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
