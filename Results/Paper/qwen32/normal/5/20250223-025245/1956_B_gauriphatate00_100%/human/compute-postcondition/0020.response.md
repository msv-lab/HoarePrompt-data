The value of `max_score` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `max_score` is 0, so after the operation, `max_score` becomes 1. The values of `count_a`, `n`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`; `max_score` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `num` is in `count_a`; the current value of `count_a[num]` is 2.
