Output State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `count_a` will contain each unique integer from the list `a` as keys, and the values will represent how many times each integer appears in the list.
