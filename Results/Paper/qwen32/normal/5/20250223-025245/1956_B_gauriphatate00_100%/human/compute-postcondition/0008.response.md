The code snippet `count_a[num] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count_a` by 1. Given the initial state, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `num` is the next integer in the list `a` after the previously processed one.

Thus, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `num` is the next integer in the list `a` after the previously processed one, `count_a[num]` is incremented by 1.**
