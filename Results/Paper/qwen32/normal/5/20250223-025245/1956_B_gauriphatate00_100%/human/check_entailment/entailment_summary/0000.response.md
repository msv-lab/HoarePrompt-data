### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the card game by taking your turns optimally. According to the problem statement, you get a point if the card you play already has a matching card on the table. 

The key insight is that you can only get a point if you have a pair of the same card in your hand. Each pair of the same card in your hand allows you to get one point because you can play the first card, and Nene can play the second card, or vice versa. This is because Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, but she cannot prevent you from scoring points if you have pairs.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of unique integers in the list `a` that appear exactly 2 times, which directly corresponds to the number of points you can get if you play optimally. Therefore, the function is correct based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
