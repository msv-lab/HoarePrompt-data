The given code snippet only modifies the value of `max_score` by incrementing it by 1. The variables `count_a`, `n`, and `num` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`; `n` is greater than 0; `num` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `max_score` is increased by 1.**
