Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`; `match_c` is `True`; `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and `_` is less than `t`; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same; `template` remains the same; `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter**
