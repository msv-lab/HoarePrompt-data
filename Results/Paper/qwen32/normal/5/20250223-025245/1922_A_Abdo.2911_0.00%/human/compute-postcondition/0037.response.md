Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False`; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, and `match_a_b` remain the same. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
