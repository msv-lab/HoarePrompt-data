Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, otherwise `match_a_b` remains as per the precondition. `match_c` is True, `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings, `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
