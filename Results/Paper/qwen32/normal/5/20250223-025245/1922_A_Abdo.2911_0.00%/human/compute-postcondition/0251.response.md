Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`. If `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to `False`. `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. `template` remains the same. `i` is 5. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `match_c` is set to `False`.**
