Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`; `match_c` is `True`; the current value of `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same; `template` remains the same; `template[i]` is a lowercase letter; `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.**
