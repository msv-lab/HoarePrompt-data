The code snippet appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list with the additional element `a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
