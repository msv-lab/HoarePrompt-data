The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of the variables do not change, except for the flow of the program being altered by the `break`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`; `match_c` is `False`; `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same; `template` remains the same; `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
