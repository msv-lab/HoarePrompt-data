Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`, `match_a_b` retains its initial value, `i` is 2. If `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
