The code snippet appends the character `a[i]` to the `template` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` remain unchanged. The only change is that `template` now contains the character `a[i]` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are strings input by the user; `c` is a string input by the user; `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; at the current index `i`, the character of `a[i]` is equal to the character of `b[i]`.**
