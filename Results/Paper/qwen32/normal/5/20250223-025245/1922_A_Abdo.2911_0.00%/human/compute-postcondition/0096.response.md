Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are new strings input by the user; `template` is an empty list; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `b`**
