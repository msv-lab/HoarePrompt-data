The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and the precondition specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are mentioned but not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
