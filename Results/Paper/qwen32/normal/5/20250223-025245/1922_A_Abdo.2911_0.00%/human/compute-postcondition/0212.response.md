Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is True, `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings, `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
