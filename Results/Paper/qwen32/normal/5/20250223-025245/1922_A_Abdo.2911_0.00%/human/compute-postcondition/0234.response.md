Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`; `match_c` is `False`; the current value of `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and `_` is less than `t`; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same; `template` remains the same; `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter; `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. No other variables are affected, and their states remain as specified in the initial state.
