### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while string `c` does not.

1. **Template Construction**:
   - For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the program checks if the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same.
   - If they are the same, it appends the lowercase version of `a[i]` to the template because both `a` and `b` must match the same character in this position.
   - If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template because `a` and `b` must differ in this position.

2. **Matching Check**:
   - The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match this character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must differ from the lowercase version of this character.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must match this character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must differ from the lowercase version of this character.

3. **Output**:
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Verification:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It constructs a template based on the characters in `a` and `b`, then verifies if `a` and `b` match this template while `c` does not. The example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is correct and matches the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
