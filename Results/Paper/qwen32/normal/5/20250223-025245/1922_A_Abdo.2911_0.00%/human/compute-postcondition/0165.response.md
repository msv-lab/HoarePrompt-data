Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` is False if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` and `template[i]` is not lowercase, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value. `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
