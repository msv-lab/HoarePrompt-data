Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1 and `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]`; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `match_a_b` retains its value based on whether mismatches were found, `match_c` remains True, `_` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `n` remains an input integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the stripped input strings, and `template` is updated to include `a[i]` if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes `a[i]` in uppercase. The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
