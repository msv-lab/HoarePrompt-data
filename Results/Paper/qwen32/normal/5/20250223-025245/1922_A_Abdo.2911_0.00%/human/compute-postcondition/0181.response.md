The code snippet `template.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` in string `a` to the `template` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1, and `_` must be less than `t`; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that now includes the character `a[i]` at the end; the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are equal.**
