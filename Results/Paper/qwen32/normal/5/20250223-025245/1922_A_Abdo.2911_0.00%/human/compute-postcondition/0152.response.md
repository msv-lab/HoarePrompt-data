The code snippet sets `match_c` to `False`. This change does not affect the values of `match_a_b`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is False; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1.**
