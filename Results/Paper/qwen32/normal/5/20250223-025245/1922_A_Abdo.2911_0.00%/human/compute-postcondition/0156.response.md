The code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. This statement does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is False; `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
