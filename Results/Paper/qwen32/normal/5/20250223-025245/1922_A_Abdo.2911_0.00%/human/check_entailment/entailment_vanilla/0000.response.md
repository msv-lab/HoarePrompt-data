Let's break down the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n`, and then reads the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Constructing the Template:**
   - For each position `i` in the strings, the program checks if the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same.
     - If they are the same, it appends `a[i]` (lowercase) to the template.
     - If they are different, it appends `a[i].upper()` (uppercase) to the template.
   - This ensures that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, they must match the template at that position (lowercase requirement).
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template character is uppercase, ensuring that `c[i]` cannot match if it is the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

3. **Checking Matches:**
   - The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks that neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of the template character.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks that `c[i]` is not equal to the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

The logic in the program correctly constructs the template based on the conditions provided and checks the matches accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
