Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` retains its initial value, `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter. The current value of `template[i]` is such that either `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`, and `template` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
