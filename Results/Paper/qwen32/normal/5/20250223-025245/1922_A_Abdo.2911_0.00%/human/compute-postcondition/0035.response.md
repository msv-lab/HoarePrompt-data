The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i` (from the previous iteration), and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is `False` if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is `False` if `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`; otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`. `i` is `i + 1`**
