The code snippet `template.append(a[i].upper())` appends the uppercase version of the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. This operation does not affect the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i` directly except for the change in `template`.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1 and `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]`, and now includes the uppercase character `a[i]` at the end; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.**
