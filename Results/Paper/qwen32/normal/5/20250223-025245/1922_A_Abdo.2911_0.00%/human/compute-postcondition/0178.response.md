The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `template`. This action does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1, and `_` must be less than `t`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is an empty list.**
