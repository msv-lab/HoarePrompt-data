Output State: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1, and `_` must be less than `t`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string.**

In simple terms, the value of `a` is now the input string with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. All other variables remain unchanged.
