Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
