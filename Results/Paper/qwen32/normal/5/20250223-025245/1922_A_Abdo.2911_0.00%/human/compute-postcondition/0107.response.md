Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is a positive integer input by the user; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, `template` will be a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` corresponds to a character from `a` at the same index. If the character in `a` matches the character in `b` at that index, the character is added to `template` as is. If they do not match, the uppercase version of the character from `a` is added to `template`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` remain unchanged except for the `template` list which is fully populated based on the described logic.
