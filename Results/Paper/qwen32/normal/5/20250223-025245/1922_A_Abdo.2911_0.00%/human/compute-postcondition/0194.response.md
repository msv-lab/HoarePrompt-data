Output State: **`match_a_b` is True; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `match_a_b` has been explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
