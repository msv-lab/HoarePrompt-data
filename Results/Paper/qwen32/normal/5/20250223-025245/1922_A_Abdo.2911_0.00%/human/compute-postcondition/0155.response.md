Output State: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is False; `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1.**

In simple terms, `match_c` has been set to False, while `match_a_b` remains unchanged based on its original condition. The values of `n` and `i` are still valid as specified in the initial state.
