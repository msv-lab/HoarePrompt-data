You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Rules:
- If the `i-th` letter of the template is lowercase, then `s_i` must be the same as `t_i`.
- If the `i-th` letter of the template is uppercase, then `s_i` must be different from the lowercase version of `t_i`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem as follows:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then iterates through each character of the strings to check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for at least one position `i`, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
- If the loop completes without finding such a position, it sets `l` to 'NO'.
- Finally, it prints `l` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic to determine if a template exists is flawed. The current code only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for at least one position. This does not guarantee that we can construct a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.
- The program does not correctly handle the template matching rules. It does not consider the possibility of creating a template where some characters are uppercase and others are lowercase.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if we can construct a template `t` such that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be the lowercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, but not `c[i]`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly determine if a valid template exists for each test case.
