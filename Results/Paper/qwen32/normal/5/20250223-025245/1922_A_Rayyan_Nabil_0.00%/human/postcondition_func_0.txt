The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If such an index exists for a test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
