The code snippet `l = 'YES'` directly assigns the string 'YES' to the variable `l`. This assignment overrides the previous conditional logic that determined the value of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, `n` is a newly input integer that must be at least 1, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is the newly input string, `c` is the newly input string, and `l` is 'YES'**.
