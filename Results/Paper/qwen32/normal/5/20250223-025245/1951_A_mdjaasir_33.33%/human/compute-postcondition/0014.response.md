Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and the number of occurrences of '1' in `a` (denoted as `count`) is exactly 2. Additionally, either the first '1' in `a` is at the last position of the string, or the character immediately following the first '1' is also '1'.**
