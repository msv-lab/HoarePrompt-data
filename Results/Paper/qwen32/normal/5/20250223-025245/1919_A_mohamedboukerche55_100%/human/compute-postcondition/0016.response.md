Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the new string input provided; `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Regardless of whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, `i` is incremented by 1.**
