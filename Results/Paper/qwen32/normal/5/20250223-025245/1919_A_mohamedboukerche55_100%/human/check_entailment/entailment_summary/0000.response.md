### Reasoning:

The problem essentially revolves around the parity (evenness or oddness) of the total number of coins between Alice and Bob. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis**:
    - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally.
    - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally.

2. **Strategy**:
    - The game involves turns where the player can choose to swap wallets or not, and then remove one coin.
    - The key insight is that if the total number of coins is even, the last move will be made by Bob (since Alice starts, and they alternate turns), leaving Alice unable to make a move.
    - Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will make the last move, leaving Bob unable to make a move.

3. **Program Analysis**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
    - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).
    - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
    - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

The program correctly implements this logic based on the analysis above. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. If the sum of coins is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.
Correctness: **True**
