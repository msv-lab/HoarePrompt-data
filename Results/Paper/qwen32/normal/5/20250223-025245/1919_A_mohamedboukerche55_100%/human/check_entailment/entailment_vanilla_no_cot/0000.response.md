To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic used in the program against the problem description.

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns exchanging wallets and removing a coin until one of them cannot make a move. The key observation here is that the game state is determined by the total number of coins (a + b) and whether this number is even or odd.

The provided program uses the total number of coins (a + b) to determine the winner:
- If (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

To understand why this works, consider the following:

1. **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):**
   - If the total number of coins is even, the players can always make moves such that the remaining total number of coins remains even after each move. This means that after all moves, the last player to move will leave an even number of coins for the opponent, who will then be unable to make a move (since the last coin will be taken by the player who leaves an even number of coins). Since Alice starts first, Bob will be the one to make the last move and win.

2. **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):**
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the players can always make moves such that the remaining total number of coins remains odd after each move. This means that after all moves, the last player to move will leave an odd number of coins for the opponent, who will then be unable to make a move (since the last coin will be taken by the player who leaves an odd number of coins). Since Alice starts first, she will be the one to make the last move and win.

Given this analysis, the logic in the provided program correctly determines the winner based on whether the total number of coins is even or odd.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
