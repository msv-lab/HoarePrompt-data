The value of `s` is assigned the result of `input()`, which means `s` will hold the string input provided by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially provided as an integer input and is within the range 1 <= `t` <= 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the string input provided.
Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the string input provided.**
