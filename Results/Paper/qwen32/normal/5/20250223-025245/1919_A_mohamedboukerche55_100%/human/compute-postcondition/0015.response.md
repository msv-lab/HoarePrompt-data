The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `i`) and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `s` is a new string input provided.
- `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new `s`.
- `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be just the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
