### Reasoning:

The problem requires simulating the optimal play of a game where Alice and Bob take turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. The original assessment suggests that the program's logic, which only checks if the sum of coins `(a + b)` is even or odd, is insufficient to determine the winner because it does not account for the optimal strategy of swapping wallets.

Let's analyze the program and the function summary in detail:

- **Function Summary:** The function reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'Bob' if the sum `(a + b)` is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

- **Game Analysis:**
  - **Case 1:** If `a == b`, both players have the same number of coins. Since they can always mirror each other's moves (swap when the other swaps, remove a coin when the other removes a coin), the player who starts (Alice) will always be forced into a losing position if the total number of coins is even. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position.
  - **Case 2:** If `a != b`, the player with more coins can force the other player into a losing position by always keeping the game symmetrical (i.e., making sure that the player with fewer coins is always the one to move first in a symmetrical situation).

From the above analysis, we can conclude that:
- If `(a + b)` is even, Alice will lose if both play optimally.
- If `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will win if both play optimally.

This logic matches the program's approach of checking the parity of the sum `(a + b)`. Therefore, the program is correct based on the optimal strategy described.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is incorrect for certain cases. The program's logic, which checks the parity of the sum of coins, correctly determines the winner based on optimal play.

**Final:** **True**
