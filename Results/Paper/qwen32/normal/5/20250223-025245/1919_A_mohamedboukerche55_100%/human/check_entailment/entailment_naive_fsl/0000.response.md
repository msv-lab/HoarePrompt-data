Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the game's rules and optimal play by both players.

Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate the issue:

1. **Test Case: 1 1**
   - According to the program, since (1 + 1) % 2 == 0, it outputs 'Bob'.
   - However, as described in the problem statement, Alice cannot make a move after her first turn, so Bob wins. The program's output is correct in this case.

2. **Test Case: 1 4**
   - The program outputs 'Alice' because (1 + 4) % 2 != 0.
   - The problem statement shows that Alice can win by swapping wallets and then removing coins optimally. The program's output is correct in this case.

3. **Test Case: 2 2**
   - The program outputs 'Bob' because (2 + 2) % 2 == 0.
   - If Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice can swap wallets on her first turn, making the situation symmetrical again (2 2). Bob will then be forced into a losing position. Therefore, Alice should win, not Bob. The program's output is incorrect in this case.

4. **Test Case: 3 3**
   - The program outputs 'Bob' because (3 + 3) % 2 == 0.
   - Similar to the previous case, Alice can swap wallets on her first turn, making the situation symmetrical again (3 3). Bob will then be forced into a losing position. Therefore, Alice should win, not Bob. The program's output is incorrect in this case.

The logic in the program does not account for the optimal strategy of swapping wallets, which can change the outcome of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect for these and other cases where the sum of coins is even but the first player can still win with optimal play.
