The code snippet initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros. Given the initial state, the value of `n` is specific to each test case, and `t` represents the number of test cases. The other variables `k` and `t` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**
