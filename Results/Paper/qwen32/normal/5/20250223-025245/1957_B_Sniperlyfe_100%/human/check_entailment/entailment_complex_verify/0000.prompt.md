You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the sum of `nums[i]` for i from 1 to n-1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest of the elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k` and the subsequent elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which the remaining elements are 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. The subsequent elements are the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k` until `k` becomes 0, after which the remaining elements are 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Sum Constraint**: The sequence \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) must sum up to \( k \).
2. **Bitwise OR Constraint**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of \( a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n \) should be maximized.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to construct the sequence by initializing the first element to the largest number just below the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( k \). It then distributes the remaining sum among the rest of the elements.

Let's break down the code:
1. **Initialization**: `nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` sets the first element to the largest number with the same number of bits as \( k \) but all bits set to 1, except the highest bit which is not set. This is intended to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
2. **Distribution**: The remaining sum \( k \) is distributed among the rest of the elements, ensuring that the sum constraint is satisfied.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Initialization Issue**: The initialization of `nums[0]` might not be optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. The highest power of 2 minus 1 might not always be the best choice. For example, if \( k \) is a power of 2, the initialization would set `nums[0]` to \( k-1 \), which might not be optimal.
2. **Distribution Issue**: The distribution of the remaining sum might not always result in the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR. For instance, if the remaining sum is small, it might not be distributed in a way that maximizes the number of 1s.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it works correctly:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 1, k = 5`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Actual Output: `5` (Correct)
2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 2, k = 3`
   - Expected Output: `1 2` or `2 1`
   - Actual Output: `3 0` (Incorrect)
3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 2, k = 5`
   - Expected Output: `5 0` or `0 5`
   - Actual Output: `5 0` (Correct)
4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 6, k = 51`
   - Expected Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12` or any other valid sequence
   - Actual Output: `31 1 1 1 1 1` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the correct output for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. Specifically, the initialization and distribution logic do not handle all edge cases optimally.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR for certain cases. For example, in the second test case, the output `3 0` does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR compared to `1 2`. In the fourth test case, the output `31 1 1 1 1 1` does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR compared to `3 1 1 32 2 12`.
