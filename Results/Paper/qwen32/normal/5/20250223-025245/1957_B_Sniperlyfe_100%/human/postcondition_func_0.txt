The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. The subsequent elements are the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k` until `k` becomes 0, after which the remaining elements are 0.
