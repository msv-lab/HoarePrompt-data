The code snippet modifies the value of `nums[i]` where `i` is 3. The new value is the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `k` is `k - min(1 << k.bit_length() - 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `k` remains 0.
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers where:
  - `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
  - `nums[1]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `nums[1]` is 0.
  - `nums[2]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `nums[2]` is 0.
  - The rest of the elements in `nums` are 0.
- `i` is 3.

After executing the code `nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, `nums[3]` is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `k` is `k - min(1 << k.bit_length() - 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `k` remains 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[1]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `nums[1]` is 0, `nums[2]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `nums[2]` is 0, `nums[3]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and the rest of the elements in `nums` are 0, `i` is 3.**
