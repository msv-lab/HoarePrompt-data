Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `k` is `k - 2 * min(1 << k.bit_length() - 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `k` remains 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[1]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `nums[1]` is 0, `nums[2]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `nums[2]` is 0, `nums[3]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` > 0, otherwise `nums[3]` is 0, and the rest of the elements in `nums` are 0, `i` is 3.**
