Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of `nums` is calculated as `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. The subsequent elements of `nums` are the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k` until `k` becomes 0, after which the remaining elements are filled with 0.**
