You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and `m` lines of edge values `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific sum `s` modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is derived from the input values and the defined operations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's analyze the program and identify the issues:

1. **Computation of the expected value**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It then initializes `s` (sum of expected friendship values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values).
   - For each friend pair, it adds the initial friendship value `f` to `a`.
   - For each excursion, it updates the sum `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

2. **Issues in the formula**:
   - The formula used to update `s` is incorrect. The expected contribution of each friend pair to the sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the probability of selecting that pair and the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.
   - The current formula does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

3. **Expected behavior**:
   - For each friend pair, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f+k-1) \).
   - This sum can be calculated as \( k \cdot f + \frac{k \cdot (k-1)}{2} \).
   - The expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum is then this value multiplied by the probability of selecting that pair, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

4. **Correct formula**:
   - The total expected sum of friendship values for all excursions can be calculated by summing the expected contributions of all friend pairs.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        total_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected increase in friendship value for this pair over k excursions
            expected_increase = (k * f + (k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M
            # Probability of selecting this pair in one excursion
            probability = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
            # Contribution of this pair to the total expected sum
            contribution = (expected_increase * probability) % M
            total_sum = (total_sum + contribution) % M
        print(total_sum)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions based on the problem description.
