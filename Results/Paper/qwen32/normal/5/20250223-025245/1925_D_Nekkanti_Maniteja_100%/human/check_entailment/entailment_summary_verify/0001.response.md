### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem, the program code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the provided program.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
- **Input:** Multiple test cases, each with `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions. For each pair of friends, their friendship value is given.
- **Output:** For each test case, print the expected sum of friendship values modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) using the `pow` function. This inverse is used to calculate the probability of selecting any pair.
   - It initializes `s` (sum of expected values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values).

2. **Reading Friendships:**
   - The program reads the details of each pair of friends and adds their initial friendship values to `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value by iterating over the number of excursions (`k`).
   - The formula used in the loop is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, which seems incorrect based on the problem description.

#### Correct Formula Derivation:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be derived by considering the contribution of each friend pair.
- For a pair with initial friendship value \( f_i \), the expected contribution after `k` excursions is:
  \[
  \sum_{j=1}^{k} \left( f_i + j - 1 \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \left( f_i \cdot k + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
  \]
- Summing over all pairs:
  \[
  \sum_{\text{all pairs}} \left( f_i \cdot k + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
  \]
  This can be further simplified to:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{\text{all pairs}} f_i \cdot k + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \cdot m \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
  \]
  Which translates to:
  \[
  \left( a \cdot k + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \cdot m \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
  \]

#### Program Code Analysis:
- The program uses `c` as the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\).
- The correct formula should be:
  \[
  s = \left( a \cdot k + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \cdot m \right) \cdot 2 \cdot c
  \]
- However, the provided program uses:
  \[
  s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
  \]
  This formula is incorrect because it does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the expected value. The correct formula should be used to ensure the expected value is calculated accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
