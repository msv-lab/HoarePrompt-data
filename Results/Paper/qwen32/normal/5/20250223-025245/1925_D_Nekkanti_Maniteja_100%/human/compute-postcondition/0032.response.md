Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is `f`; `i` is `k`; `s` is 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to be equal to `f`. All other variables retain their initial values.
