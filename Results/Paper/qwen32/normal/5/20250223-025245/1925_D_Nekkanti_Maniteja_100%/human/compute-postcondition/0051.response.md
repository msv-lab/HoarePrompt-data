The provided code snippet only reassigns the value of `M` to `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is the same as its initial value. Therefore, no other variables are affected, and their states remain the same. The value of `M` is explicitly set to `1000000007`, which is consistent with its initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are new integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input; `i` is `k + m`; `s` is `(c * k * (c * m * (k-1) + 2 * a)) // 2`; `m` iterations have been completed; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input for each of the `m` iterations.**
