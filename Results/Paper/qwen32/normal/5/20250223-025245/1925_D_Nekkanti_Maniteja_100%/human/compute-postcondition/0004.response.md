The code snippet only initializes the variable `s` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is 0.**
