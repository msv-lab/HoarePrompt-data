The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k` and `m` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1` and `m` must still be greater than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is `f`; `i` is `k + 1`; `s` is 0; `m` must be greater than `k + 1`; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**
