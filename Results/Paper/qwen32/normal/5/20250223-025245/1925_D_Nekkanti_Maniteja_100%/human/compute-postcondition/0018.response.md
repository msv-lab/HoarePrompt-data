The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is `c * a`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input across all `m` iterations; `i` is 1**
