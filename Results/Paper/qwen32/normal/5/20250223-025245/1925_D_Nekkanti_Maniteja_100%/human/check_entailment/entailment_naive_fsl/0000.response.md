Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's analyze the program and identify the issues:

1. **Computation of the expected value**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It then initializes `s` (sum of expected friendship values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values).
   - For each friend pair, it adds the initial friendship value `f` to `a`.
   - For each excursion, it updates the sum `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

2. **Issues in the formula**:
   - The formula used to update `s` is incorrect. The expected contribution of each friend pair to the sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the probability of selecting that pair and the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.
   - The current formula does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

3. **Expected behavior**:
   - For each friend pair, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f+k-1) \).
   - This sum can be calculated as \( k \cdot f + \frac{k \cdot (k-1)}{2} \).
   - The expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum is then this value multiplied by the probability of selecting that pair, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

4. **Correct formula**:
   - The total expected sum of friendship values for all excursions can be calculated by summing the expected contributions of all friend pairs.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        total_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected increase in friendship value for this pair over k excursions
            expected_increase = (k * f + (k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M
            # Probability of selecting this pair in one excursion
            probability = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
            # Contribution of this pair to the total expected sum
            contribution = (expected_increase * probability) % M
            total_sum = (total_sum + contribution) % M
        print(total_sum)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions based on the problem description.
