The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state includes `t` with its initial value and `a`, `b`, and `c` with the values provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input.**
