The code snippet provided assigns new values to `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the user input. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. The variable `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1, but there is no code in the snippet that modifies `i`, so `i` retains its previous value plus 1 from wherever it was incremented previously. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
