Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the case where `a == b` or `b == c` or both, which are not explicitly checked. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle cases where `a < b` and `b == c`, or `a == b` and `b > c`, which should result in "NONE".

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Input:
```
2
1 2 2
2 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
NONE
NONE
```

Actual Output:
```
STAIR
PEAK
```

In the first test case, `a < b` but `b == c`, so it should be "NONE". In the second test case, `a == b` but `b > c`, so it should also be "NONE". The program incorrectly identifies these as "STAIR" and "PEAK" respectively.
