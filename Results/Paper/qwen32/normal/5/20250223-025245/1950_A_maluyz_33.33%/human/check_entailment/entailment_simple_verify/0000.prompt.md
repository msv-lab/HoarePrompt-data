You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the t test cases consists of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input by the user, and for each iteration, the program prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'NONE' if `a == b == c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after the loop ends; only the printed outputs remain.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the case where `a == b` or `b == c` or both, which are not explicitly checked. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle cases where `a < b` and `b == c`, or `a == b` and `b > c`, which should result in "NONE".

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Input:
```
2
1 2 2
2 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
NONE
NONE
```

Actual Output:
```
STAIR
PEAK
```

In the first test case, `a < b` but `b == c`, so it should be "NONE". In the second test case, `a == b` but `b > c`, so it should also be "NONE". The program incorrectly identifies these as "STAIR" and "PEAK" respectively.
