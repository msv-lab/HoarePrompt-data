Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the following:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a == b == c`, it prints "NONE".
- If `max(a, b, c) == b`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

While the first two conditions are correct, the third condition has a problem. The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is not sufficient to determine if the digits form a peak. It only checks if `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, but it does not ensure that `a < b > c`. For example, the input `1 3 2` would incorrectly be classified as "PEAK" by this condition.

The correct condition for a peak should be `a < b > c`.

Let's correct the program and re-evaluate:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected. Given the original program, the response is:

Correctness: **False**
