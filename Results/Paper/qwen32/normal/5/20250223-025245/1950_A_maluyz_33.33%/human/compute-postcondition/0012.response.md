The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state provides conditions about the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement, as it directly outputs the string `'NONE'`.

Let's break down the given conditions:
1. `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
2. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input.
3. It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
4. `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal.
5. The maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.

These conditions are used to set up the context for `a`, `b`, and `c`, but they do not influence the execution of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
