Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`; `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is equal to `a[0]`; `i` is `n-1`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `last_year` is now set to the first element of the list `a`. All other variables retain their previous values.
