The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `index + n`, but since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take in the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value `n-1` (the last value in the range `1` to `n`), so for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1 and checked against `n`.

Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, the next value of `i` should be `1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + n`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]`, `next_year` is `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]`, `i` is 1**
