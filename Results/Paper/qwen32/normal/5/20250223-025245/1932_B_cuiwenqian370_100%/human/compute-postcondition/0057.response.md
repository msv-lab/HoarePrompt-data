The code snippet appends the string representation of `last_year` to the `results` list. This means that `results` will now have three elements: the string representation of `last_year` repeated twice, followed by the string representation of `last_year` again.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`, `last_year`, and `last_year`, `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is the final value calculated after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `next_year` is the final value of `last_year`.**
