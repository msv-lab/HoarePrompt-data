Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's calculate the output state.

Initial State:
- `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace.
- `input` holds the entire input string.
- `index` is `index + n`.
- `T` is an integer value greater than 0.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `last_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.
- `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.
- `i` is 2.

Code Snippet:
```python
next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
```

The expression simplifies to:
```python
next_year = (last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]
```

This expression is equivalent to the previous definition of `next_year` in the initial state.

Therefore, the value of `next_year` remains the same after the execution of the code snippet. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `i` is 2.**
