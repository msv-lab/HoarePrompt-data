#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function `func_1` will be called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different strings b, each of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the total sum of all n values across all test cases will not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an encoded string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a unique character starting from 'a' in reverse order based on the sorted set of characters in `b`.
