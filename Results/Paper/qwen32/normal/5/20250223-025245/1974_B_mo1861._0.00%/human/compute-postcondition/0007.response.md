The code snippet updates the `char_map` dictionary by assigning a new value to the key `c`. The new value is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

Given the initial state:
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and has at least one character.
- `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`.
- `char_map` is updated with `char_map[c]` being `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b` after its previous value.

After the execution of the code snippet:
- The value of `char_map[c]` is updated to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and has at least one character; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is updated with `char_map[c]` being `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b` after its previous value.**
