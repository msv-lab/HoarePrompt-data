Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the string as per the problem description. The issue lies in the construction of the `char_map` dictionary. The current implementation maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in reverse order starting from 'a', which is incorrect.

The problem requires mapping each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character from the string `r` (which consists of distinct letters of `b` in alphabetical order). The symmetric character of the first character in `r` should be the last character, the second character should be the second from the end, and so on.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create a sorted set of unique characters from b
    r = sorted(set(b))
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    # Decode the string b using the mapping
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases. The original implementation incorrectly maps characters, leading to incorrect decoding.
