The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `c`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sorted set of `b`. If there are more unique characters in `b` to process, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `c` should be the next character in the sorted set of `b`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current` and the current character `c` as `c_current`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_current + 1` and `c` will be the next character in the sorted set of `b` after `c_current`.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and has at least one character; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is updated with `char_map[c]` being `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`; `i` is `i_current + 1`; `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b` after `c_current`.**

Since we don't have the specific value of `i_current` and `c_current`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and has at least one character; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is updated with `char_map[c]` being `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b` after its previous value.**
