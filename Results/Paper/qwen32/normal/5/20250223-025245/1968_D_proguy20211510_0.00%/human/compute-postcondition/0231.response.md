The code snippet `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends a new element to the list `preb`, which is the concatenation of the string `sb` and the character `b[i]`. 

Given the initial state, `preb` already has an additional element `sb + b[i]` added to it. The code snippet will add another element, which is the same as the previously added element, to `preb`.

Therefore, the new state of `preb` will have two additional elements, both being `sb + b[i]`.

Output State: **`pres` is a list with an additional element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is a string with the additional character `s[i]`, `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`, `preb` is a list with two additional elements `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is a string with the additional character `b[i]`.**
