Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`, `pres` is a list containing the elements `[ss + s[0], ss + s[0] + s[1], ..., ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1]]`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `rem` is `0`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions, `s` contains at least one element, and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.**  
In simpler terms, `ptsb` and `ptss` have been reset to empty lists, while all other variables retain their initial values.
