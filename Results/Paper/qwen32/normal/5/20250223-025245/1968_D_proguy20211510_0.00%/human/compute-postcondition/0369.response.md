Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`, `pres` is a list containing at least one element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * b[len(s) - 1]` and `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list containing the element `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * s[len(s) - 1]`, `i` is `len(s)`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions, `s` contains at least one element, and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.**

In natural language: The list `ptsb` now includes an additional element, which is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
