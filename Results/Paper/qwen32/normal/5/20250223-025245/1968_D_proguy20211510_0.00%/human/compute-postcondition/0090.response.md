Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `founds` is True, `s` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `founds` is set to True and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]` and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is set to True. If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the conditions related to `foundb` and `founds` and the updates to `b`, `s`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as described in the precondition.**
