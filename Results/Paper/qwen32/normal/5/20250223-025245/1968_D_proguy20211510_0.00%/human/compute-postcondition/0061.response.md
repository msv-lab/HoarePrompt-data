Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1. If `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa` and an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa` and an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true and `founds` is false, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `founds` is true, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `founds` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`; `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. `b` now includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `b` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the value of `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial states unless further modified by subsequent code.
