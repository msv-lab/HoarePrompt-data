Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `foundb` is false. If `founds` is true, then `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s`. Additionally, the element at index `pb - 1` in the list `a` is not equal to `maxa`. The list `b` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end. `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `pb` has been updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
