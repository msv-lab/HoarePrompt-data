The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bodya'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. Therefore, the output is straightforward.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides detailed descriptions of various variables and lists (`preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `i`, `rem`, `maxs`, `maxb`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is simply `print('Bodya')`, which outputs the string `'Bodya'`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Bodya**
