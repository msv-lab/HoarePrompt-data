Output State: **`pres` is a list with an additional element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is a string with the additional character `s[i]`, `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, `preb` is a list with an additional element `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is a string with the additional character `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pres.append(ss + s[i])` adds another element to the list `pres`, which is the concatenation of `ss` and `s[i]`. The other variables (`ss`, `s`, `i`, `preb`, and `sb`) remain unchanged in their described states.
