The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Sasha'`. The initial state provides detailed information about various variables and lists, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Sasha')`.
2. The string `'Sasha'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The initial state describes several variables and lists (`preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `i`, `rem`, `maxs`, `maxb`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
