The code snippet `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the value at the index `pb - 1` in the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly dependent on `pb` for their calculation or value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is False or True; `foundb` is False; `b` and `s` are lists, where if `founds` is True, `b` and `s` each contain `[-maxa]`; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index, recalculated if `founds` is True; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index, recalculated if `founds` is True; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, updated to `-maxa` if `founds` is True; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, updated to `-maxa` if `founds` is True; `ptsb` is a list containing recalculated values based on the new `preb` and `b` if `founds` is True; `ptss` is a list containing recalculated values based on the new `pres` and `s` if `founds` is True; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `founds` is True; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `founds` is True; `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`; `b` is now a list containing the previous elements of `b` plus `a[pb - 1]`**

In simpler terms, `pb` has been updated to the value of the element at index `pb - 1` in the list `p`. All other variables retain their previous values.
