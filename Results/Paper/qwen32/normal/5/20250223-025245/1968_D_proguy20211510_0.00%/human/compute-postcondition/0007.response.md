The code snippet assigns a new list `a` by reading a line of input, splitting it into strings, converting each string to an integer, and collecting these integers into a list. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers obtained by converting the previously split input strings to integers; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers.**
