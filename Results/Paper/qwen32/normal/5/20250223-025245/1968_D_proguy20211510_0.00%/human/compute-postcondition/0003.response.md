The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations specified by the input. 

Given the loop statement `for _ in range(int(input())):`, the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer read from the input. The state of `t` directly determines whether the loop will execute or not. 

Since `t` is already provided as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the loop head only involves `t` through `range(int(input()))`, no other variables in the loop head need adjustment. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute, as `t` is already within the valid range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
