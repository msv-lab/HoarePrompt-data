The code snippet `b.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `b`. Given that `b` initially contains `[-maxa]` (if `founds` is True), after appending `maxa`, `b` will be `[-maxa, maxa]`.

The cumulative sums (`preb`) and the sum of all elements in `b` (`sb`) will also be updated. The new `preb` will be `[-maxa, 0]` (cumulative sum of `[-maxa, maxa]`), and `sb` will be `0` (sum of `[-maxa, maxa]`).

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is False or True; `foundb` is True; `b` is `[-maxa, maxa]`; `s` is `[-maxa]`; `i` is `k`; `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]`; `pres` is `[-maxa]`; `sb` is `0`; `ss` is `-maxa`; `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b` if `founds` is True; `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s` if `founds` is True; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `founds` is True; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `founds` is True. If `founds` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
