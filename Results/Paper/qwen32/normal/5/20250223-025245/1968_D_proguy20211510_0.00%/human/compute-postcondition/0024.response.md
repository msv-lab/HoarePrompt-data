The provided code snippet initializes two boolean variables, `founds` and `foundb`, to `False`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers obtained by converting the previously split input strings to integers; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to `maxa`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` remains unchanged, whether or not it is equal to `maxa`. `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list; `founds` is False, `foundb` is False.**
