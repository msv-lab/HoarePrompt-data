Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the variables and their relationships to understand what the `print` statement will output.

### Key Points from the Initial State:
1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer in the range 1 to 10,000.
   - `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are given values.
   - `b` and `s` are lists of length `k`.
   - `i` is set to `k`.
   - `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`.
   - `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s`.
   - `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`.
   - `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`.
   - `ptsb` and `ptss` are lists calculated based on the cumulative sums and the elements of `b` and `s`.
   - `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
   - `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
   - `maxs` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `maxb`.

2. **The Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains only `print('Draw')`.

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Draw'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement. The statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'Draw'`, the output will be exactly that string, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **Draw**
