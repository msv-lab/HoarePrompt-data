The code `ss += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ss`. This means that `ss` now includes the additional character `s[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pres` is a list with an additional element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is a string with the additional character `s[i]`, `s` is a string, `i` is an integer.**
