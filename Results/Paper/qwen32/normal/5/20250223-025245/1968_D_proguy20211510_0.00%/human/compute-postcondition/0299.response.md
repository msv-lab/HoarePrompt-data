The provided code snippet appends the element `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Given the initial state, `s` was an empty list because `founds` was False, but now `founds` is True, and `s` will have one element, which is `a[ps - 1]`.

Here's the updated state:
- `s` is now a list containing the single element `a[ps - 1]`.
- `founds` is True.
- `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements. Since `s` now has one element, `pres` will have one element which is `a[ps - 1]`.
- `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, which is now `a[ps - 1]`.
- `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, which simplifies to `a[ps - 1] + (k-1) * a[ps - 1]` or `a[ps - 1] * k`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, which is now `a[ps - 1] * k`.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with one element `a[ps - 1]`, `sb` is 0, `ss` is `a[ps - 1]`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list with one element `a[ps - 1] * k`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is `a[ps - 1] * k`, `maxb` is undefined, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` and `foundb` is False, `s` is a list with one element `a[ps - 1]`, and `founds` is True.**
