The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into four parts, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, but `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
