The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print('Bodya')` statement given the initial state provided.

Let's break down the information given in the initial state:

- `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`.
- `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements.
- `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`.
- `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`.
- `ptsb` is a list calculated based on `preb` and `b`, adjusted by the value `k`.
- `ptss` is a list calculated based on `pres` and `s`, adjusted by the value `k`.
- `i` is `len(pres) - 1`.
- `rem` is `k - len(pres)`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- `n` and `k` are integers.
- `pb` and `ps` are integers.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.
- There is a comparison between `maxs` and `maxb`, but it does not affect the `print('Bodya')` statement.

The `print('Bodya')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It will always print the string 'Bodya'.

Output: **Bodya**
