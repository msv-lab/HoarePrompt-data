Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0. `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. `founds` is false, so `s` does not include an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s`.**
