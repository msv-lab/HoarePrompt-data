Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[k - 1] + 0 * b[k - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list containing `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[k - 1] + 0 * s[k - 1]]`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, the current value of `maxs` is greater than the current value of `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
