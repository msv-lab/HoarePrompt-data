The code snippet appends the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `b` is initially `[-maxa, maxa]` if `founds` is True. After appending `a[pb - 1]` to `b`, the new `b` will be `[-maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1]]` if `founds` is True.

Here's the output state in the required format:

Output State: **`foundb` is True; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; if `founds` is True, `b` is `[-maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1]]`, `s` is `[-maxa, maxa]`, `i` is `k`, `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]`, `pres` is `[-maxa]`, `sb` is `0`, `ss` is `-maxa`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `founds` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `founds` is True. If `founds` is False, the values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new conditions.**
