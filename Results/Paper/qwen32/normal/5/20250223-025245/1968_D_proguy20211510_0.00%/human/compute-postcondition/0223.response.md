The code snippet provided appends the result of the expression `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. This means the list `pres` will have one additional element, which is the concatenation of `ss` and the element at index `i` of the string `s`. The values of `ss`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the modification to the `pres` list.

Output State: **`pres` is a list with an additional element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is a string, `s` is a string, `i` is an integer.**
