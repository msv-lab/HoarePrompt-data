The code snippet provided appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. This action does not affect any other variables except for `s`, which gains a new element.

Given the initial state, the value of `a[ps - 1]` is added to the end of the list `s`. The other variables retain their initial values unless they are directly impacted by the code snippet, which they are not in this case.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
