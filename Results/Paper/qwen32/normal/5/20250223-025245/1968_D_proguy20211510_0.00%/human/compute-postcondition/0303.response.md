Postcondition: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]`, `sb` is 0, `ss` is `a[ps - 1]`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing `k * a[ps - 1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is `k * a[ps - 1]`, `maxb` is undefined, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` and `foundb` is False, `s` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]`, and `founds` is True.**

In simpler terms: After the if-else block, `pres` will contain `a[ps - 1]`, `sb` will be 0, `ss` will be `a[ps - 1]`, `ptsb` will be updated based on `preb` and `b`, `ptss` will contain `k * a[ps - 1]`, `i` will be `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` will be `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` will be `k * a[ps - 1]`, `maxb` will be undefined, `s` will contain `a[ps - 1]`, and `founds` will be True. The values of `preb`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, and `b` remain as per their initial conditions or as modified by the if condition.
