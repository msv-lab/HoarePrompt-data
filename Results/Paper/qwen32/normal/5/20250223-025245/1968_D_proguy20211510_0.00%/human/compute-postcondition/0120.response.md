The value of `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is initially `k`, the expression `k - (i + 1)` simplifies to `k - (k + 1)`, which is `-1`. Therefore, `rem` becomes `-1`.

All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[k - 1], preb[k - 1]`; `ptss` is a list containing `pres[k - 1], pres[k - 1]`; `rem` is -1.**
