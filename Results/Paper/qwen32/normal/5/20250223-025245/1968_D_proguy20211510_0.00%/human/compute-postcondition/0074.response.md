The code appends `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(k - (2 + 1)) * maxa`, which is `(k - 3) * maxa`.

Therefore, the list `s` will now include an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`.**
