Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the elements `sb + b[i]` and `sb + b[i] + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing the elements `s[k - 1] + s[k - 1]` and `s[k] + s[k]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i] + b[i]`; `ss` is `s[k - 1] + s[k]`; `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`; `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`; `i` is `k`; `rem` is `0`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions; `s` contains at least one element, and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `ss` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (`s[k - 1]`) and `s[i]` (which is `s[k]` since `i` is `k`). The other variables remain unchanged.
