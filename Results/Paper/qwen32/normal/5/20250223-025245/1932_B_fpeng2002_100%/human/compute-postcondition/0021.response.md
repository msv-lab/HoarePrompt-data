The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `len(nums)`. To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 1, because the `range(0, len(nums))` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, and the loop will execute if there is at least one number in this sequence.

The states of `t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `start_year` are not directly relevant to the execution of the for loop, so we do not need to adjust them.

Given the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least one element. Since `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, we can adjust the state to reflect that `nums` must have at least one integer.

The variable `x` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is now `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least one integer; `start_year` is 0**
