Given the code snippet and the initial state, let's determine the output state step by step:

- `start_year` is initially 0.
- The code modifies `start_year` using the formula: `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

Since `start_year` is 0, the expression simplifies as follows:
- `start_year // nums[x]` will be 0 because any number divided by a positive integer (which `nums[x]` is, since `nums` is a list of integers obtained from space-separated input values) will result in 0 when the numerator is 0.
- Adding 1 to the result gives 1.
- Multiplying 1 by `nums[x]` sets `start_year` to `nums[x]`.

Given this, the new value of `start_year` is `nums[x]`.

The other variables (`t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`) are not modified by this code snippet, so they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is now `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least one integer; `start_year` is `nums[x]`.**
