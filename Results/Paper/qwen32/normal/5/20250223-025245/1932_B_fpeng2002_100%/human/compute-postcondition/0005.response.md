The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `nums`. The variables `t`, `num_tests`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is a positive integer and is now reduced by 1 from its initial value; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers.**
