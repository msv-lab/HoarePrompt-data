Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is now `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and has at least one integer; `start_year` is recalculated as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`; `x` is `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. `num_tests` has been decremented by 1. `n` remains the input integer. `nums` remains the list of integers derived from the input. `start_year` is recalculated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`. `x` remains unchanged.
