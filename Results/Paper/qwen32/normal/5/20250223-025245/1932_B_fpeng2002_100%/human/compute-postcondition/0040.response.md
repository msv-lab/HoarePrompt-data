To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the `start_year` is updated in each iteration. The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list, updating `start_year` according to the formula:

\[ \text{start\_year} = (\text{start\_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x] \]

Here's how the `start_year` evolves:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - `start_year` becomes `nums[0]` because `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] = nums[0]`.

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - `start_year` becomes `((nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])`.

4. **Third Iteration**:
   - `start_year` becomes `(((nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.

Following this pattern, after all iterations, `start_year` will be:

\[ \text{start\_year} = (((\ldots((0 // \text{nums}[0] + 1) * \text{nums}[0]) // \text{nums}[1] + 1) * \text{nums}[1]) // \ldots // \text{nums}[n-1] + 1) * \text{nums}[n-1] \]

In simpler terms, `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous operations. This can be seen as the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in `nums`, starting from the first number and updating iteratively.

Thus, after all iterations, the output state will be:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; num_tests is at least 0; n is the input integer; nums is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; start_year is the smallest multiple of nums[-1] that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous operations, effectively the LCM of nums.**

In natural language, `start_year` will be the least common multiple of all the numbers in the `nums` list after all iterations of the loop.
