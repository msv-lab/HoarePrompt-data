### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The core of the program is the loop that iterates over the list of periodicities and calculates the year when each subsequent sign will occur.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Calculation of the Occurrence Year**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year when the next sign is expected to occur.
   - The program iterates over each periodicity in the list `nums`.
   - For each sign `i`, the program calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. This is done using the formula:
     \[
     \text{start\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{start\_year}}{\text{nums[x]}} + 1\right) \times \text{nums[x]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` after the current `start_year`.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when the n-th sign will occur.

### Verification with the Example:

Let's verify the program with the first example provided:

- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Execution**:
  - `start_year = 0`
  - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
- **Output**: `36`

This matches the expected output for the first example.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur by iteratively updating the `start_year` to the next multiple of each sign's periodicity. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
