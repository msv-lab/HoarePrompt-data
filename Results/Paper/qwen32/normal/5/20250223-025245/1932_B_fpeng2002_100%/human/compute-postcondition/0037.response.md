To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the given code snippet on the variables provided in the initial state. The code snippet modifies the value of `start_year` based on the values of `start_year`, `nums`, and `x`.

Given the initial state, `x` is incremented by 1, and then `start_year` is recalculated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This means `start_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of `nums[x]`.

Here's how the variables are affected:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `num_tests` remains at least 0.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `nums` remains a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer.
- `x` was incremented by 1, so its new value is `x + 1`.
- `start_year` is recalculated to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `x` is `x + 1`; `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.**
