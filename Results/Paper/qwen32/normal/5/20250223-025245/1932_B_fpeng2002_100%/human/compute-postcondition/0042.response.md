Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is 0; `n` is the input integer from the last iteration; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers from the last iteration; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the `nums` list from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `num_tests` will be reduced to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `nums` will hold the values from the last test case processed, and `start_year` will be the least common multiple of the numbers in `nums` from that last test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop.
