Reasoning: 
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be transformed to all zeros using the specified operations. The main issue is in the approach to modifying the array elements. The program attempts to directly manipulate the elements based on the value of the current element, which does not align with the operation rules described in the problem statement.

The operation allows choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) and performing the following:
- Subtract 1 from \( a_{i-1} \).
- Subtract 2 from \( a_i \).
- Subtract 1 from \( a_{i+1} \).

The provided program instead tries to manipulate the elements in a way that doesn't preserve the constraints and doesn't correctly simulate the operation. Specifically, the line `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` do not correctly reflect the operation rules. Additionally, the logic for checking if the transformation is possible is flawed.

A correct approach would involve ensuring that each element can be reduced to zero in a sequence of valid operations, respecting the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
