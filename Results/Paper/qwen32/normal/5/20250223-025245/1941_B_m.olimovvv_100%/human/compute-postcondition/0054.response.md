The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. This means that the previous values of `b`, which were `b[-2] is 0, b[-1] is 0`, are overwritten by the new input values. The values of `a` and the output remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, the output is 'YES', and `b` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
