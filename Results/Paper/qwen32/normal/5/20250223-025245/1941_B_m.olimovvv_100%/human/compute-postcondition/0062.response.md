The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to `0` because subtracting a value from itself results in `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is greater than 2
- `b[i]` is unchanged
- `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`
- `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`

After executing `b[i] -= b[i]`, the value of `b[i]` becomes `0`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is greater than 2; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`.**
