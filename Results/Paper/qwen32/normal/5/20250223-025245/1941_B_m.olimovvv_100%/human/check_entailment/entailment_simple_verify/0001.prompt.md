You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

        for i in range(0, a - 2):

                break

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation:
- Choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`).
- Decrease `a[i-1]` by 1.
- Decrease `a[i]` by 2.
- Decrease `a[i+1]` by 1.

### Program Analysis

The given program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `b`.

2. **Processing:**
   - It iterates over the array from the first element to the third last element (`for i in range(0, a - 2)`).
   - For each element `b[i]`, it attempts to reduce the array elements according to the operation:
     - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]`
   - If at any point an element becomes negative, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If not, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation:**
   - The operation is supposed to reduce `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1. However, the program incorrectly reduces `b[i + 1]` by `b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2]` by `b[i]`. This does not match the problem's operation.

2. **Negative Value Check:**
   - The program checks for negative values immediately after modifying the array. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the operation can be applied validly. The operation should be applied only if all resulting values are non-negative.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire array can be made zero. The program should ensure that all elements are zero after the operations.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made zero using the described operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
