Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is at least 4.
- `i` is 2.
- `b[0]` is 0.
- `b[1]` is 0.
- `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`.
- `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `b[0]`, `b[1]`, `b[2]`, and `b[3]` are provided, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement explicitly prints the string `'NO'`.

### Calculation of `b[2]` and `b[3]`:
- Since `b[1]` is 0, the expression for `b[2]` simplifies to `b[2] - 2 * 0`, which is just `b[2]`.
- Similarly, the expression for `b[3]` simplifies to `b[3] - 0`, which is just `b[3]`.

Thus, the values of `b[2]` and `b[3]` remain unchanged from whatever initial values they had, but their exact values are not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
