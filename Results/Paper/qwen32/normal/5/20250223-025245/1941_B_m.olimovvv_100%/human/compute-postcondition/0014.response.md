Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is unchanged, and `b[i + 2]` is unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
