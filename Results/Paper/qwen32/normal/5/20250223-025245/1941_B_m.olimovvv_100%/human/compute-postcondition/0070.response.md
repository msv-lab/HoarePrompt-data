The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a - 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given that `a` is greater than `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `a` remains greater than the new value of `i + 2` for the loop to continue executing.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`** 

Note that the other variables (`b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop condition.
