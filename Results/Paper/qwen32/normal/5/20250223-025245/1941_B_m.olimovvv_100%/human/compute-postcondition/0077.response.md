To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to analyze the provided loop code and the given output states for the first three iterations.

Let's break down the loop:

1. **Loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3` (since the range is `range(0, a - 2)`). This means the loop will execute `a - 2` times if `a` is greater than 2.
2. **Loop body**:
   - If `b[i]` is less than 0, the loop prints 'NO' and breaks.
   - Otherwise, it modifies the list `b` by:
     - Subtracting `2 * b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`.
     - Subtracting `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`.
     - Setting `b[i]` to 0.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`):
  - `b[0]` is 0.
  - `b[1]` is updated to `b[1] - 2 * b[0]` (which leaves `b[1]` unchanged since `b[0]` is 0).
  - `b[2]` is updated to `b[2] - b[0]` (which leaves `b[2]` unchanged since `b[0]` is 0).
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`):
  - `b[1]` is 0.
  - `b[2]` is updated to `b[2] - 2 * b[1]` (which leaves `b[2]` unchanged since `b[1]` is 0).
  - `b[3]` is updated to `b[3] - b[1]` (which leaves `b[3]` unchanged since `b[1]` is 0).
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`):
  - `b[2]` is 0.
  - `b[3]` is updated to `b[3] - 2 * b[2]` (which leaves `b[3]` unchanged since `b[2]` is 0).
  - `b[4]` is updated to `b[4] - b[2]` (which leaves `b[4]` unchanged since `b[2]` is 0).

From the pattern, we can infer:
- At each iteration `i`, `b[i]` is set to 0.
- The values of `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` are adjusted based on the value of `b[i]` before it is set to 0.

After the loop completes, `i` will be `a - 3` (the last index processed), and `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, and `b[i + 2]` will have been modified accordingly.

The `else` clause of the loop checks if the last two elements of `b` (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are both 0. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given that the loop sets `b[i]` to 0 at each step and modifies `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` based on `b[i]`, the final output depends on the initial values of `b` and how they are modified throughout the loop.

However, based on the provided information and the typical behavior of such loops, we can infer that if the loop completes without breaking and the initial conditions are such that the last two elements of `b` are 0 after all iterations, the output will be 'YES'.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **YES**.

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is 'YES', assuming the initial conditions and modifications throughout the loop result in the last two elements of the list `b` being 0.
