The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to be the next value it should take in the loop. The value of `a` does not need to be adjusted as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1. Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `i + 1` for the next iteration. However, we know that `i` was previously less than `a - 2` for the loop to have executed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is unchanged; `b[i + 2]` is unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1**

Given the above, the next state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is unchanged; `b[i + 2]` is unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we need to specify the exact state and `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be the value it took at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then the next value of `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. But since we don't have `i_prev`, we denote the next value of `i` as `i + 1`.

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is unchanged; `b[i + 2]` is unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`**

But to make it more concrete in terms of the loop condition, we can say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is unchanged; `b[i + 2]` is unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the next value that satisfies `i < a - 2`**
