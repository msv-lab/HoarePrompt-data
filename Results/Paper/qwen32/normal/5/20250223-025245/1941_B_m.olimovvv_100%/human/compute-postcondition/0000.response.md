In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is controlled by `t`, which is the number of test cases.
2. The loop will execute `t` times, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
3. The variables `n` and `a` (the list of integers) are defined inside the loop body and do not affect whether the loop can execute or not.
4. The state of `t` directly determines whether the loop will execute.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n` and `a` do not need to be adjusted because they are defined within the loop body and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1**
