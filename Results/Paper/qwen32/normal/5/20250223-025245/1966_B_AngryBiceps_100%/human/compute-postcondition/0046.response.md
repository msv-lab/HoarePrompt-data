The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement is independent of the initial state described. The `print` function will output the string `'NO'` exactly as it is specified, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
