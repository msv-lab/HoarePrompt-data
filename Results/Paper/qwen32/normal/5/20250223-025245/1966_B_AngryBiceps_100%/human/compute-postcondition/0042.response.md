The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`.

Given the initial state, `first_row` was the concatenation of the first characters of the first two input values. After executing the code, `first_row` will now include the first character of the third input value as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements which are the input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value concatenated with the first character of the second input value and the first character of the third input value, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value concatenated with the last character of the second input value, `i` is 2.**
