### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if it is possible to make all squares in a given grid the same color by performing a series of operations. Each operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The provided solution checks two conditions:
1. If the first and last rows of the grid are composed of the same character and are different from each other.
2. If the first and last columns of the grid are composed of the same character and are different from each other.

If either of these conditions is met, the solution outputs "NO", implying that it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

Let's analyze why these conditions are relevant:
- If the first and last rows are the same color but different from each other, it means there is a clear division in the grid where one part is all 'W' and the other part is all 'B'. The operation described cannot bridge this division.
- Similarly, if the first and last columns are the same color but different from each other, it creates a similar division that cannot be bridged by the operation.

However, the solution does not consider all possible configurations that might prevent making the entire grid the same color. For example, if there are two distinct rectangular regions of 'W' and 'B' that do not share any common row or column, the solution would incorrectly output "YES".

A more robust solution would involve checking if there is a path of the same color that can connect all squares in the grid. This can be determined using graph traversal techniques or flood fill algorithms to see if the grid can be fully colored using a single color.

Given the current logic, there are cases where the solution might output "YES" when it should output "NO". Therefore, the provided solution is not correct for all possible inputs.

### Correctness: **False**
