The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. Given that `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `a[-1]` refers to this single element. Therefore, `a[-1][-1]` is the last character of the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the input provided by the user, `last_row` is the last character of the input provided by the user.**
