The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those for the loop to execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `i` is `n-1`, this means that before the first iteration of the loop, `i` is already set to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, `i` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is `0` by default when using `range(n)`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `0`.

The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted because it is already given as the first integer from the input and determines the number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
