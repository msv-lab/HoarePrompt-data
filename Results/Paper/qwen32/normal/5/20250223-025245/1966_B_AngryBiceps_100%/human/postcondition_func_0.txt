The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each grid, it checks if the first and last rows are composed of the same character and are different from each other, or if the first and last columns are composed of the same character and are different from each other. If either condition is met, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.
