The `print('YES')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'YES', regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`. The precondition describes various conditions about these variables, but they do not influence the output of this specific print statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
2. The variable `n` is the first integer from the input.
3. The variable `m` is the second integer from the input.
4. The variable `a` is a list of `n` elements, which are the input values.
5. The variable `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first characters of each element in the list `a`.
6. The variable `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last characters of each element in the list `a`.
7. The variable `i` is set to `n-1`.

The conditions provided about the elements of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` do not affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement. The statement simply outputs the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
