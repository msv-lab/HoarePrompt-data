The initial state provides us with several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`. The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements.
- `first_row` is a string of the first characters of each element in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string of the last characters of each element in `a`.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- Additional conditions about `first_row` and `last_row` are provided, but they do not affect the `print` statement.

Given the `print('NO')` statement, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
