The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Given the initial state, `a` contains one element which is the input provided by the user. Therefore, `a[-1]` refers to this single element, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of this element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the input provided by the user, `last_row` is an empty string.**
