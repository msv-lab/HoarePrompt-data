Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string containing the first characters of each of the `n` input strings concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` input strings concatenated in order, `i` is `n-1`. The set of characters in `first_row` is of size 1, the set of characters in `last_row` is of size 1, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.**
