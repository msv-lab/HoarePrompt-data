The `print('NO')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement. The print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **NO**
