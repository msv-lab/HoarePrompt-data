The code snippet provided assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables; it only changes the value of `l` to be the same as `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and if `m` is 2, the condition `m == 2` is true. Additionally, `a1` appears before `a2` in `l3`, `l` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**
