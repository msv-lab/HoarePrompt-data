The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means that the element at `idx2` and all elements after it will be shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, the list `l1` will have `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `m`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is an empty list; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
