The `print('yes')` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables, lists, or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes a variety of variables and lists (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
