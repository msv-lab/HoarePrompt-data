Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `m` retains its original value. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line. `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`. `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. The current state is such that `l11` is not equal to `l22`.**
