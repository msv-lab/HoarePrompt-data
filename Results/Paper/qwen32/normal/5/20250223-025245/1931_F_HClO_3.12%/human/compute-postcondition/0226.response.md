The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that the list `val` will now contain one more element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged except for `val`, which now includes the newly appended tuple.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least `n + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` from the initial state and an additional tuple `(a3, l3)` appended by the code, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input.**
