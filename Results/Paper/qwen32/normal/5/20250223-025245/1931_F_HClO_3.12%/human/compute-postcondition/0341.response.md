Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input unless `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` was initially 2, in which case `m` becomes 1, or if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` was initially greater than 2, in which case `m` becomes `m - 1`. `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, or `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a2` inserted at `idx1`. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`. `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `idx1` remains greater than `idx2`, and `val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, and `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the new input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
