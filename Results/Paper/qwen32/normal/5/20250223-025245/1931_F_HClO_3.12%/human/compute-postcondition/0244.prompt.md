Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input minus 1 if `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, otherwise `m` remains unchanged, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements from `l` excluding all occurrences of `a3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing at least one more tuple `(a3, l3)` after the previously processed tuple, and `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
