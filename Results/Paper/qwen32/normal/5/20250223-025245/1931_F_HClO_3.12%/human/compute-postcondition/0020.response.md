The task involves analyzing the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`m`**: An integer with a minimum value of `m` (the exact value is not provided).
3. **`a1`**: The first integer from a new input line.
4. **`l1`**: A list of the remaining integers from the same line as `a1`.
5. **`a2`**: The first integer from another new input line.
6. **`l2`**: A list of the remaining integers from the same line as `a2`.
7. **`l11`**: A list created by removing all elements from `l1` that are equal to `a2`.
8. **`l22`**: A list created by removing all elements from `l2` that are equal to `a1`.
9. **Additional Condition**: `l11` is not equal to `l22`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. This output is independent of the values of `t`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22`. The condition `l11` is not equal to `l22` is given but does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'no'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **no**
