The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of iterations the loop will execute. Since the loop has completed all iterations without breaking, it means that the loop variable `_` has iterated `t` times, and `t` has reached 0. To execute one more iteration, `t` must be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop has completed all iterations, the current state of `t` is 0. To start another iteration, `t` should be set to 1.

State: **the loop has completed all iterations without breaking and prints 'yes', `t` is 1**
