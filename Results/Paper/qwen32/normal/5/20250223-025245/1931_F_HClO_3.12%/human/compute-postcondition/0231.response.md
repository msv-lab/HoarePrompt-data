The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the list `val`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `val`. If `val` has at least one tuple, the loop will execute.

Given that `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, for the loop to execute, `m - 2` must be at least 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `val` must have at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, which implies that `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`**
