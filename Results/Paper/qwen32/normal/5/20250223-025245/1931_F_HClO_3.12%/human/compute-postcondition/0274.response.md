The `break` statement in the provided code will terminate the most internal loop or if statement but will not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). The current elements at index `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are `a2` and `a1` respectively, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
