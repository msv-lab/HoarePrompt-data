The provided code snippet only contains an `input()` statement, which reads a line of input from the user but does not assign it to any variable. Therefore, none of the variables in the initial state will be affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`. The new input provided is not stored in any variable.**
