The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means that the list `l1` will now have `a1` as its element at the index `idx2`, and all elements originally at and after `idx2` will be shifted one position to the right.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and if `m` is 2, the condition `m == 2` is true. Additionally, `a1` appears before `a2` in `l3`.**

In simple terms, the list `l1` now includes `a1` inserted at the index `idx2`, shifting other elements to the right. All other variables remain unchanged.
