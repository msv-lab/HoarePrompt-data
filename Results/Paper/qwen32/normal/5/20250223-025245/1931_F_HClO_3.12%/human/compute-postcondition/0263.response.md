Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`)**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are being modified or updated in the provided code snippet, all variables retain their initial values.
