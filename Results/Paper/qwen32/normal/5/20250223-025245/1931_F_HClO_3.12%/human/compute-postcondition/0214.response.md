The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This means that the list `l2` will have one more element, and all elements at and after `idx1` will be shifted to the right.

Given the initial state, `l2` is a list of integers excluding all occurrences of `a1`. After the insertion, `l2` will have `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input excluding all occurrences of `a1` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and either `m` is not 2 or the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
