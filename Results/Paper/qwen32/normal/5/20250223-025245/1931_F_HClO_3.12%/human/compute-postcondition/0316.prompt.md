Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the conditions remain as described. If `l11` is equal to `l22`, no changes are made to the variables.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). If the current elements at index `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are not equal, `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2` if the current elements at index `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are equal to `a2` and not equal to `a2` respectively, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `n - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is 0, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
