The code snippet `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `l` is now the same as `l2`, which is a list containing elements from the latest input excluding all occurrences of `a1` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input excluding all occurrences of `a1` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and either `m` is not 2 or the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l` is a list containing elements from the latest input excluding all occurrences of `a1` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`.**
