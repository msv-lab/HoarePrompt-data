Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `n - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.**
