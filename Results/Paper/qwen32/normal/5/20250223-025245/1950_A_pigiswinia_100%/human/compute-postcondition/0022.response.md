The given code snippet contains a print statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the print statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'PEAK'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The print statement is `print('PEAK')`.
2. The string `'PEAK'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.
3. The variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the print statement.
4. Since there are no variables or expressions in the print statement that need to be evaluated, the output is directly the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
