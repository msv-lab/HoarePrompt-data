### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given set of three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**: 
    - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
    - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK".
    - If neither of the above conditions is true, it outputs "NONE".
4. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate result for each test case.

The logic and the conditions used in the program accurately reflect the problem's requirements. The execution summary aligns with the program's behavior, and there are no discrepancies or errors mentioned in the summary.
