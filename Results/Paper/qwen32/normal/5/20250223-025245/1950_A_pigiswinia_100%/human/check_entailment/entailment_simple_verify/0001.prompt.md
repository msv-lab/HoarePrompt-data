You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains the same, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, and for each of the `t` test cases, the appropriate output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') has been printed based on the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to determine if three given digits form a "stair," a "peak," or neither.
2. A "stair" is defined by the condition a < b < c.
3. A "peak" is defined by the condition a < b > c.
4. If neither of the above conditions is met, the output should be "NONE".
5. The program reads the number of test cases, t, and then processes each test case individually.
6. For each test case, it reads three integers (a, b, c) and checks:
   - If a < b < c, it prints "STAIR".
   - If a < b > c, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
7. The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program accurately solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
