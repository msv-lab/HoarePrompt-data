Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000. It returns `y`, a divisor of `x` satisfying `2 * y >= x` and `x > 2` (Case_1). If no such `y` exists, it reduces `y` by one until it finds a valid divisor or reaches a condition where it returns `y` that is one less than its original value (Case_2 and Case_3). If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists (Case_4).**
