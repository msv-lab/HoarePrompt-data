You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    #The program returns max_val, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000 and returns the largest divisor `y` of `x` that satisfies `2 * y >= x`. If no such divisor exists, it returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or `1` if no such divisor exists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \(\le\) \( y \) < \( x \)) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). 

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val
```

The code iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking if \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)). If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \). Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues. Finally, it returns `max_val`.

The problem is that the code does not guarantee that it finds the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). It only returns the first divisor it finds that satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), which might not be optimal.

For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
- The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
- The code will check 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.
- When it checks 5, it finds that \( 10 \% 5 == 0 \) and \( 2 * 5 \ge 10 \), so it returns 5.
- However, \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
- If we check \( y = 6 \), \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\).
- If we check \( y = 9 \), \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

Here, \( y = 9 \) also gives the maximum value of 10, but the code does not consider it because it does not satisfy \( 2 * y \ge x \).

Thus, the code does not always find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
