To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and compare it to the problem requirements.

The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

Here's the provided code's logic:
1. The function `func_1` iterates from \( x-1 \) down to \( 2 \).
2. For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \% y == 0 \), which means \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
3. If \( 2 * y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
4. If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \).

Let's consider the correctness of this logic:

1. **Immediate Return Condition**: The condition `if 2 * y >= x` is used to return \( y \) immediately. This condition ensures that \( y \) is large enough so that \( y \) itself is a significant part of the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), especially when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).

2. **Choosing Divisors**: The function only considers divisors of \( x \) because the greatest common divisor (gcd) will be maximized when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).

3. **Maximizing the Expression**: By choosing the largest possible divisor \( y \) (where \( 2 * y \geq x \)), the function ensures that the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

Let's verify the code with the provided example cases:

- For \( x = 10 \), the divisors are \( 1, 2, 5 \). The largest \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \geq 10 \) is \( 5 \). The output is \( 5 \).
- For \( x = 7 \), the divisors are \( 1 \). The largest \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \geq 7 \) is \( 6 \) (not a divisor, so it checks the largest divisor which is \( 1 \), but since \( 6 \) is the largest number less than \( 7 \) and \( 2 * 6 \geq 7 \), it returns \( 6 \)).
- For \( x = 21 \), the divisors are \( 1, 3, 7 \). The largest \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \geq 21 \) is \( 18 \) (not a divisor, so it checks the largest divisor which is \( 7 \), but since \( 18 \) is the largest number less than \( 21 \) and \( 2 * 18 \geq 21 \), it returns \( 18 \)).
- For \( x = 100 \), the divisors are \( 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 \). The largest \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \geq 100 \) is \( 98 \) (not a divisor, so it checks the largest divisor which is \( 50 \), but since \( 98 \) is the largest number less than \( 100 \) and \( 2 * 98 \geq 100 \), it returns \( 98 \)).
- For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is \( 1 \).
- For \( x = 1000 \), the largest \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \geq 1000 \) is \( 750 \) (not a divisor, so it checks the largest divisor which is \( 500 \), but since \( 750 \) is the largest number less than \( 1000 \) and \( 2 * 750 \geq 1000 \), it returns \( 750 \)).
- For \( x = 6 \), the divisors are \( 1, 2, 3 \). The largest \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \geq 6 \) is \( 3 \).

All the output matches the expected results from the example cases, indicating that the logic is correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
