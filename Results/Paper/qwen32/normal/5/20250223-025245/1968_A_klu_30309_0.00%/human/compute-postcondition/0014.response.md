The only object in the loop head is the variable `y`. According to the code, the loop iterates with `y` starting from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `x` is greater than 2, we need to adjust `y` to `y - 1` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `y` was some value `k` (where `k` is between 2 and `x - 1`). At the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `k - 1`.

Since the exact value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration is not given, we can only express the state in terms of the decrement.

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `y` is `y - 1`**
