Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 2. If `x` is divisible by `y`, then `max_val` is set to `y`. If `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`, `y` is set to `y - 1`. Otherwise, `y` is set to `y - 1` and `max_val` remains 1. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, then `y` is set to `y - 1` and `max_val` remains 1.**
