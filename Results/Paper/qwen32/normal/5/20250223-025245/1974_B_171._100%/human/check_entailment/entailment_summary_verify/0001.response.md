### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the encoded string `b`.
   - It first creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character in `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings for all test cases are stored in the list `results`.
   - These results are printed one by one.

### Checking the Logic:

- **Uniqueness and Sorting:**
  - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`. This matches the problem's requirement.

- **Symmetric Mapping:**
  - The mapping of characters to their symmetric counterparts in `r` is correctly implemented. Each character in the encoded string `b` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r` as required.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program handles multiple test cases by iterating through each one, reading the necessary inputs, and storing the results.

### Function Summary Validation:
- The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`. It states that the function takes an encoded string and returns a decoded string by mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It accurately constructs the string `r`, maps characters symmetrically, and handles multiple test cases.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
