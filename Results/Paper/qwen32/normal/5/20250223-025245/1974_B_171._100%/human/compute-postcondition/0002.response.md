The code snippet calculates the length of the `unique_chars` list and assigns it to the variable `len_unique`. The other variables, `encoded` and `char_map`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.**
