Correctness: **False**

The provided program performs the encoding process instead of decoding. The `func_1` function is designed to map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters list, which is the encoding process, not the decoding process.

To correct the program, the mapping should be reversed. Specifically, for each character in the encoded string, it should be mapped to the character that was originally mapped to it during the encoding process.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]  # Reverse the mapping
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

With this change, the program will correctly decode the encoded string back to the original string.
