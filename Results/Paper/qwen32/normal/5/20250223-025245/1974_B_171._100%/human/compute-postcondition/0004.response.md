The code snippet assigns a value to the `char_map` dictionary. Specifically, it maps the character at index `i` of the `unique_chars` list to the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` of the same list. This effectively reverses the mapping of characters in `unique_chars`.

Given the initial state:
- `encoded` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded` and has at least 1 character.
- `char_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `len_unique` is greater than 0.

After executing the code snippet, the `char_map` dictionary will have a new entry where the character at index `i` of `unique_chars` is mapped to the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` of `unique_chars`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded` that must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is greater than 0.**
