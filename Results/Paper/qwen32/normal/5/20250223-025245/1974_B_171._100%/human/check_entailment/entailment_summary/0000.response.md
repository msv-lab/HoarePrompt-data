### Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Unique Characters Extraction and Sorting**:
   - The program first extracts all unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically. This step is crucial as it determines the mapping of characters for decoding.

2. **Character Mapping**:
   - It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each unique character is mapped to its symmetric counterpart from the sorted list of unique characters. This is done by mapping the first character to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - Using the mapping created, the program replaces each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping. This effectively reverses the encoding process.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case individually, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the decoded strings for each test case.

5. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints by using sets to extract unique characters and sorting them, which ensures that the time complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the problem constraints.

6. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary provided aligns with the program's functionality, confirming that the program is correctly performing the decoding process as intended.

### Correctness:
Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly decodes the encoded strings as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
