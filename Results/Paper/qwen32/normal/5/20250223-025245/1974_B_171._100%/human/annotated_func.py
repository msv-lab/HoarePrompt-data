#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse counterpart in `unique_chars` (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on); `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` where each character in the list `encoded` has been replaced by its mapped value from the dictionary `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of strings `encoded`, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters, and returns a single string `decoded`. Each character in the input strings is replaced by its corresponding character from a mapping where each unique character in the input is mapped to its reverse counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
