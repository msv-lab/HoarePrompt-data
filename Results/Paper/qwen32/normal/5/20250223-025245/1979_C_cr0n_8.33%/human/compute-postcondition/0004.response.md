The code snippet `prod *= r` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the value of `r`. Given that `prod` is initially 1, the new value of `prod` will be `r` after this operation. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `vals` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `prod` is `r`.**
