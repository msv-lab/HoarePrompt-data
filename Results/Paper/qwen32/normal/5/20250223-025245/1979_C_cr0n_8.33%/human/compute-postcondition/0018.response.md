Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the input. It calculates the product of these integers and then computes a new list where each element is the result of dividing the product by the corresponding integer in the input list. It then calculates a denominator as the difference between the product and the sum of the new list. If the denominator is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the new list of integers. The function does not return any value.**
