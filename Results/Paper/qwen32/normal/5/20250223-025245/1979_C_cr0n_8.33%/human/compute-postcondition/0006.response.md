The code snippet `prod *= r` updates the value of `prod` by multiplying it with `r`. Given the initial state, `prod` was initially `r`, so after the operation, `prod` becomes `r * r`, which is `r^2`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least two elements; `prod` is `r^2`; `r` is `r_next`**.
