The only variable in the loop head is `r`, which iterates over the list `vals`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `r` to the next element in the list `vals`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20
- `N` is an input integer
- `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least two elements
- `prod` is `r^2`
- `r` is `r_next`

We need to move to the next element in `vals` for `r`. Therefore, `r` should be updated to the next element in the list.

If `r` was the `i`-th element in `vals` during the previous iteration, it should now be the `(i+1)`-th element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least two elements; `prod` is `r_next^2`; `r` is the next element in `vals` after `r_next`**
