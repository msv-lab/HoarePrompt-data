Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least `N` elements; `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`; `vprod` is a list where each element is the integer division of `prod` by the corresponding element in `vals`; `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)` and the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0**.
