You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
cases = int(input())
for n in range(cases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
    vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the input. It calculates the product of these integers and then computes a new list where each element is the result of dividing the product by the corresponding integer in the input list. It then calculates a denominator as the difference between the product and the sum of the new list. If the denominator is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the new list of integers. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the bets `x_i` is flawed. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then uses this product to derive the bets, but this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```

Explanation for the expected output:
If you bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total bet is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins. If any outcome wins, you receive back 2 * 1 = 2 coins for that outcome, which is not strictly greater than 3. Therefore, this specific case should output `-1` because there is no valid distribution of bets.

However, the provided program will output:
```
2 2 2
```

This is because the product of the multipliers (2 * 2 * 2 = 8) divided by each multiplier gives [4, 4, 4], and the denominator (8 - (4 + 4 + 4)) is -4, which is less than or equal to 0, so it outputs `-1`. But this is not the correct logic for determining the bets.

A correct approach would be to find a set of bets that satisfies the condition for all outcomes. One simple approach is to use the smallest possible bets that satisfy the condition. For example, for the input `2 2 2`, the bets could be `1 1 1`, but as shown, this does not work. The correct approach would involve more complex logic to ensure the condition is met for all outcomes.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
