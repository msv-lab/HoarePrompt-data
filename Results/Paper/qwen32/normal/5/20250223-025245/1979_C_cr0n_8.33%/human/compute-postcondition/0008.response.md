The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `prod` by the variable `r`. Given the initial state, `prod` is initially set to `r_next^2`, and `r` is the next element in the list `vals` after `r_next`. After executing the code, `prod` will be updated to `r_next^2 * r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least two elements; `prod` is `r_next^2 * r`; `r` is the next element in `vals` after `r_next`.**
