The code snippet `thorn += 1` increments the value of `thorn` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. `thorn` is incremented by 1.**
