To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first three iterations.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `s`: List of characters from the input string.
   - `ret`: 0
   - `thorn`: 0
   - `len`: Input integer (not directly affecting the loop's logic)

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - **If `i == '@'`**:
     - `thorn` is reset to 0.
     - `ret` is incremented by 1.
   - **If `i == '*'`**:
     - `thorn` is incremented by 1.
     - If `thorn` reaches 2, the loop breaks.
   - **Else**:
     - `thorn` remains 0.

3. **Output States After Iterations**:
   - **After 1 Iteration**:
     - `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0.
     - `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0.
   - **After 2 Iterations**:
     - `ret` is 1 if any `i` was '@', otherwise `ret` is 0.
     - `thorn` is 2 if two consecutive `i` were '*', otherwise `thorn` is 1 or 0.
   - **After 3 Iterations**:
     - `ret` is 2 if two `i` were '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 or 0.
     - `thorn` is 2 if two consecutive `i` were '*', otherwise `thorn` is 1 or 0.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue iterating through the list `s` until it either encounters two consecutive '*' characters (which breaks the loop) or processes all characters in the list.

- **`ret`**: Counts the number of '@' characters encountered in the list `s`.
- **`thorn`**: Ends up being 2 if the loop breaks due to two consecutive '*', otherwise it is 0 or 1 depending on the last character processed.
- **`s`**: Remains unchanged as it is the input list of characters.
- **`len`**: Remains unchanged as it is an input integer not affected by the loop.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `ret` will be the total count of '@' characters in the list `s`.
- `thorn` will be 2 if the loop breaks due to two consecutive '*', otherwise it will be the last value of `thorn` based on the last character processed.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`ret` is the count of '@' in `s`, `thorn` is 2 if loop breaks due to '**', otherwise it is the last value of `thorn` based on the last character processed, `s` is unchanged, `len` is unchanged.**
