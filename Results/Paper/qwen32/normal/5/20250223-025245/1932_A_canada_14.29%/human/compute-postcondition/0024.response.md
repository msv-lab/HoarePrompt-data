Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is incremented by 1. If `thorn` was equal to 2 before the increment, it is now 3. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 2.**
