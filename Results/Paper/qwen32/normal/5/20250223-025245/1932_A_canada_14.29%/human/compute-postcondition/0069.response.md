The code snippet increments the value of `ret` by 1. Given the initial state, `ret` is either 1 (if the current character `i` is '@') or 0 (otherwise). After the increment, `ret` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 0.

Other variables (`s`, `len`, `thorn`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `len` is an input integer; `ret` is 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1; `thorn` is 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
