Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character. If the current character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the current character `i` is not '@', then `ret` remains 0. If `i` is equal to `'*'`, `thorn` is set to 1 unless `thorn` was already 2, in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is not equal to `'*'`, then `thorn` remains 0.**
