The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last character processed from the list `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the list `s`. Since `s` is a list of characters from the input string and must have at least 1 character, we need to ensure that there is a next character to process.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that `i` was the last character processed. To move to the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`. However, since we do not have specific information about the current position of `i` in the list `s`, we can only say that `i` should be the next character in the sequence.

State: **`ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` remains 0. `thorn` is 2 if the current character `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was 2, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was not 2, otherwise `thorn` remains 0. `len` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character. `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
