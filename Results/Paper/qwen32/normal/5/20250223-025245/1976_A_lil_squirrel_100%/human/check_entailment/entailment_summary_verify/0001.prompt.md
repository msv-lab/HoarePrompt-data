You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if a given password meets specific criteria. It returns 'YES' if the password contains all its letters in sorted order, all its digits in sorted order, and no letter is immediately followed by a digit. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the length of the password `n` and the password string `password` as arguments.
   - It initializes two lists, `letters` and `digits`, to store the letters and digits from the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns "NO".
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns "NO".
   - It iterates through the password to check if any digit follows a letter. If such a case is found, it returns "NO".
   - If all checks pass, it returns "YES".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case as specified.

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided examples:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `4`, `12ac`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - No digit follows a letter.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `5`, `123wa`
  - Letters: `['a', 'w']` (not sorted)
  - Output: `NO`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `9`, `allllmost`
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - No digits.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - Input: `5`, `ac123`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Digit `1` follows letter `c`.
  - Output: `NO`

- **Fifth Test Case:**
  - Input: `6`, `011679`
  - No letters.
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - Output: `YES`

Based on the analysis, the program correctly checks all the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem description.

Reasoning: The program correctly separates letters and digits, checks if they are sorted individually, and ensures no digit follows a letter. It handles all the given examples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
