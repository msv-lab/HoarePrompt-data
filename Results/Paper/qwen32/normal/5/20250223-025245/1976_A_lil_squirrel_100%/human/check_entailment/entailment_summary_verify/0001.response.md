Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong based on the given conditions:

1. **Separation of Letters and Digits**: The program correctly separates the letters and digits into two different lists.
2. **Sorting Check**: It checks if both the letters and digits lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Digit Following Letter Check**: It ensures that no digit follows a letter in the password.
4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where the password contains only letters or only digits correctly.

The function summary provided also aligns with the implementation, confirming that the function correctly validates the password based on the problem's requirements.

The examples given in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, and the output matches the expected results.

Final: **True**
