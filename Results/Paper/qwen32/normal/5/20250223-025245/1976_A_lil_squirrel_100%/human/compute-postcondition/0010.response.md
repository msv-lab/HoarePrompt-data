Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` is not a digit, and `digits` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, `ch` is the next character in the string `password`, and `letters` now includes the character `ch` if `ch` is not a digit.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 20. The `password` string retains its original value and length. The `letters` list now includes the character `ch` if `ch` is not a digit. The `digits` list remains unchanged. The character `ch` is still the next character in the `password` string.
