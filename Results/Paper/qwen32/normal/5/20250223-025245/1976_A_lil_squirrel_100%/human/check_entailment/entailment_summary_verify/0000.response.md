Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends).
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Provided Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` checks if a given password meets specific criteria. It returns 'YES' if the password contains all its letters in sorted order, all its digits in sorted order, and no letter is immediately followed by a digit. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that all digits come after all letters. It provides an example where the password "a1b2" would incorrectly return "YES" because it checks only that no digit directly follows a letter but does not enforce the order that all letters must come before all digits.

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting Check**: The function correctly checks if all letters and digits are sorted.
2. **Immediate Digit After Letter Check**: The function correctly checks if there is no digit immediately following a letter.
3. **Order of Letters and Digits**: The function does not explicitly check if all letters come before all digits. It only checks that no digit directly follows a letter. Therefore, a password like "a1b2" would incorrectly return "YES".

### Correctness:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not enforce the requirement that all letters must come before all digits. Thus, it fails to correctly verify the strength of passwords according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
