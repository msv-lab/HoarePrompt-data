Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, `ch` is the next character in the string `password`, and `digits` now includes `ch` as an additional element.**

In simpler terms, the `digits` list now contains the character `ch` as an extra element, while all other variables remain unchanged.
