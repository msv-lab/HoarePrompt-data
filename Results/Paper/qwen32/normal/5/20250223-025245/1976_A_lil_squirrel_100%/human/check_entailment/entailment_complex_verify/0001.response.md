Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements all the conditions required for a strong password as per the problem description. The annotated code provides a clear step-by-step explanation of the program's behavior, and the examples given in the assessment demonstrate that the program handles various cases appropriately. The program separates letters and digits, checks if they are sorted individually, and ensures that no digit follows a letter. This matches exactly with the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
