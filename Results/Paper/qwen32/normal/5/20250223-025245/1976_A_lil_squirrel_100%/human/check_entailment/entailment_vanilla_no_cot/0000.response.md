Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong according to the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it's correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Character Classification**: It separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - It checks if the list of `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the list of `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Digit After Letter Check**: It iterates through the password and checks that no digit appears immediately after a letter.

5. **Output**: For each password, it prints "YES" if all conditions are met, otherwise it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all the provided conditions and edge cases, such as passwords with only letters or only digits. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
