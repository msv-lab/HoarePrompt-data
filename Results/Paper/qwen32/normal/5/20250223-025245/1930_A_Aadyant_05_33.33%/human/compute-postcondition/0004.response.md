Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `list1 = []` initializes `list1` as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values as no other changes are made to them.
