The code snippet appends the sum of `list2` to the list `out`. Given the initial state, `list2` contains integer values derived from `list1`, and `out` is initially an empty list. After the operation, `out` will contain one element, which is the sum of the integers in `list2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `out` is a list containing the sum of `list2`, `list2` contains the integer values of `list1[2 * i]` for all `i` from 0 to `a-1`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `out` now contains one element, which is the sum of the values in `list2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
