Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ m < n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first m elements of `a`, and `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements that are common to both `window_freq` and `b_freq`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `good_subarrays` is set to 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains 0.**
