The code snippet provided modifies the list `a` by updating the element at index `i` to be the sum of the element at index `i-1` and the element at index `i-1` of the list `x`. Given that `i` is initially `n-1`, this operation updates `a[n-1]` to be `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

Since `a[i]` is updated based on the previous value `a[i-1]` and the corresponding value from `x`, and `i` is fixed at `n-1`, the only change is to `a[n-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, `i` is `n-1`.**
