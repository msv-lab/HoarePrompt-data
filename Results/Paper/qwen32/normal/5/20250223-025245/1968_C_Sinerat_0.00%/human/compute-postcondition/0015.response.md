The provided Python code snippet updates the list `x` by reading a new list of integers from the user input. The initial state of `x` is a list of integers, but after the execution of the code, `x` will be replaced with the new list provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**

In simpler terms, after the code runs, `x` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user, while `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged except that the values in `a` will be recalculated based on the new `x` when the subsequent code that defines `a` runs.
