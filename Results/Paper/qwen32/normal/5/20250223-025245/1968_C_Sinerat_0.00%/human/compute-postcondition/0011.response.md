Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10,000. The variable `n` is the input integer that determines the length of the list `x` and the list `a`. The list `x` consists of integers provided as input. The list `a` has its first element set to 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated as the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the list `x`.
