The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

After executing the line `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**
