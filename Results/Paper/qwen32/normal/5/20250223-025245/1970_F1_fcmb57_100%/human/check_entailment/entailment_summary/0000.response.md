Reasoning:  
The provided code has a significant issue in the `func_1` function. According to the problem statement, `func_1` is expected to perform integer arithmetic to update the position of a player based on the direction they move. However, the current implementation of `func_1` concatenates strings instead of adding integers, which is incorrect.

The `func_1` function should take two tuples of integers, representing the current position and the movement vector, and return a new tuple of integers representing the updated position. The current implementation, which concatenates strings, will not correctly update the positions of the players and will likely lead to incorrect behavior during the game simulation.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which should result in a point for the opposing team.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
