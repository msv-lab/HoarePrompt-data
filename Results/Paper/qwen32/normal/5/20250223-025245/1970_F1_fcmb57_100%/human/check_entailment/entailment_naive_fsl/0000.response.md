Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Quaffle Movement and Catching**:
   - The program does not handle the Quaffle's movement when a player catches or throws it. The Quaffle should be moved to the player's position when caught and back to the center of the field when thrown.
   - The program does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before throwing it.

2. **Goal Scoring**:
   - The program checks if the player's position is in the goals list but does not differentiate between the correct and incorrect goal for the player. If a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the program incorrectly scores a point for that player's team.
   - The program should print the correct event (either `RED GOAL` or `BLUE GOAL`) based on whether the Quaffle was thrown into the correct or incorrect goal.

3. **Movement Function**:
   - The movement function `func_1` is correctly defined but not used properly in the context of catching the Quaffle. The program does not update the Quaffle's position when a player catches it.

4. **Final Score**:
   - The final score is printed with the team scores swapped. The correct format should be `FINAL SCORE: r b`, where `r` is the score of the red team and `b` is the score of the blue team.

Here is a potential test case that demonstrates the issues:

**Input:**
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
B2 U
B2 U
B2 L
B2 C .Q
B2 L
B2 L
B2 T
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

While the output for this specific test case might appear correct, the program does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the program should score a point for the opposing team, which it does not do.

**Counterexample:**
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 0
```

In this counterexample, the red player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, but the program incorrectly scores a point for the red team.
