The code snippet `s = s + int(list2[i])` updates the value of `s` by adding the integer value of `list2[i]` to the current value of `s`. 

Given that `list2` is a sorted list of integers derived from the substrings of `b` split by whitespace, and `i` is incremented by 2 in the initial state, the value of `s` will be updated by adding the integer value of the element at the `i`-th index of `list2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`, `s` is the integer value of `list2[i]` plus the previous value of `s` plus the integer value of `list2[i]` again, `b` is a non-empty string input by the user, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace and must have at least one element, `num` is `num + 1`, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace, `i` is `i + 2`.** 

In simpler terms, the value of `s` has been updated by adding the integer value of `list2[i]` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
