The code snippet `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of substrings separated by whitespace. This affects the value of `list1` but does not change the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is an empty list; `s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `b` is a string input by the user.**
