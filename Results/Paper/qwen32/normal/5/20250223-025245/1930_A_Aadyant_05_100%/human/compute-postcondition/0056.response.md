The only object in the loop head is the variable `str` and the list `list1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `list1`. If `list1` has at least one element, the loop can execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50.
- `a` is a string input by the user.
- `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended.
- `s` is 0.
- `b` is a new string input by the user.
- `list2` is an empty list.
- `num` is `num + 1`.
- `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b`.

To ensure the loop executes, `list1` must contain at least one substring. Therefore, `b` should contain at least one character so that `list1` can be derived with at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended, `s` is 0, `b` is a string input by the user that contains at least one character, `list2` is an empty list, `num` is `num + 1`, `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b` that contains at least one element**.
