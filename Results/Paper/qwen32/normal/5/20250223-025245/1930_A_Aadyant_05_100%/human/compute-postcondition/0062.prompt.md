Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is 0; `b` is a new string input by the user; `list2` is an empty list; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b`.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended, `s` is 0, `b` is a string input by the user that contains at least one character, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n`, `num` is `num + 1`, `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b` that contains at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended, `s` is 0, `b` is a string input by the user that contains at least one character, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n` and the integer value of the second element of `list1`, `num` is `num + 1`, `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b` that contains at least two elements, `str` is the second element of `list1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended, `s` is 0, `b` is a string input by the user that contains at least one character, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n` and the integer value of the second element of `list1` and the integer value of `str`, `num` is `num + 1`, `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b` that contains at least two elements, `str` is the third element of `list1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
