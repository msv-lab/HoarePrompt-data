The code snippet sorts the list `list2`, which contains integer values of substrings from the string `b` split by whitespace. The sorting operation rearranges the elements of `list2` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `final`, `s`, `list1`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is an empty list; `s` is 0; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace.**
