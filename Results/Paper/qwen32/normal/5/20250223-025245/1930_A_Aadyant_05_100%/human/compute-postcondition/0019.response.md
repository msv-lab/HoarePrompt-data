The code snippet provided is `s = s + int(list2[i])`. This line adds the integer value of the element at index `i` in `list2` to the current value of `s`.

Given the initial state, `s` is initially 0, and `list2` is a sorted list of integers derived from splitting the string `b` by whitespace. The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state, so we assume `i` is a valid index within the bounds of `list2`.

After executing the line `s = s + int(list2[i])`, the value of `s` will be updated to its previous value plus the integer value of the element at index `i` in `list2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is an empty list; `s` is updated to `s + int(list2[i])`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user that contains at least two substrings when split by whitespace; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace, and `len(list2)` is at least 2.**
