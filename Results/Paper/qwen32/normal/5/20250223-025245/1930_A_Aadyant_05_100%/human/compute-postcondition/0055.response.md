The code snippet provided is `list1 = b.split()`, which means `list1` is assigned the value of `b.split()`. This splits the string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace.

Given the initial state, `b` is a new string input by the user. Since the exact value of `b` is not provided, we can only say that `list1` will be a list of substrings derived from `b`.

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet. Here, no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is 0; `b` is a new string input by the user; `list2` is an empty list; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b`.**
