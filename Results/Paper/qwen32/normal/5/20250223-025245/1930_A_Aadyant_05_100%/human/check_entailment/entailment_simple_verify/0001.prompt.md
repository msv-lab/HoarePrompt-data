You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0

        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**:
   - The first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, there are two lines:
     - The first line contains an integer `n` (number of pairs).
     - The second line contains `2n` integers.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the maximum final score achievable by performing the described moves optimally.

3. **Strategy**:
   - To maximize the score, always pick the smallest available numbers in each move since we add `min(x, y)` to the score.
   - Sort the list of numbers and sum up every second number starting from the first (which will be the smallest in each pair).

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and then the `2n` integers.

2. **Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program converts the input string of integers into a list `list2`.
   - The list `list2` is then sorted.
   - The program sums up every second element in the sorted list starting from the first element, which is correct according to the strategy.

3. **Output**:
   - The program stores the result for each test case in the list `final` and prints them at the end.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program reads `n` and then reads two lines for each test case, but it should only read a single line containing `2n` integers.
- The line `a = input()` is unnecessary and does not affect the program's logic, but it can be removed for clarity.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        list1 = input().split()
        list2 = [int(x) for x in list1]
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, len(list2), 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program's logic is correct, but it reads an extra line for each test case, which is not required and can lead to incorrect behavior if the input format is not strictly followed. However, based on the problem description and the provided input-output examples, the program seems to work as expected.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, we can conclude that the program is correct in terms of logic and strategy.

Correctness: **True**
