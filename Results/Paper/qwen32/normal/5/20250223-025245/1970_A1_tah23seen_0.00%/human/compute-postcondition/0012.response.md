The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the dictionary `d` by adding a new key `i + 1` with a value that is the value of `d[i]` minus 1.

Given the initial state, `d` has keys `0` and `1` mapped to the values `0` and `1` or `0` and `-1` respectively, depending on whether the character at position `i` in `s` is "(" or ")".

After executing the code, the dictionary `d` will have an additional key `i + 1` with a value that is `d[i] - 1`. The values of `s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys `0`, `1`, and possibly `i + 1`, where `d[0]` is `0`, `d[1]` is `1` or `-1`, and `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`; `i` is 1.**
