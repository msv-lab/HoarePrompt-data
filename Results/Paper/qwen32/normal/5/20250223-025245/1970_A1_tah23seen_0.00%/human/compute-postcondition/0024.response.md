The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is the string `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[i]`, and after executing the code, `ans` will be `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[i] + s[i]` which is equivalent to `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[i_next]`.

The other variables `s`, `n`, `d`, `i_next`, and `j_next` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is the string `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[i_next]`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses; `i` is `i_next`; `j` is `j_next`.**
