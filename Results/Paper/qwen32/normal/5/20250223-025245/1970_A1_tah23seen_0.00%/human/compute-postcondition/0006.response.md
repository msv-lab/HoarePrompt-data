The code snippet updates the dictionary `d` by assigning `d[i + 1]` the value of `d[i] + 1`. Given that `i` is 0 and `d[0]` is 0, `d[1]` will be `0 + 1`, which is 1. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the keys `0` and `1` mapped to the values `0` and `1` respectively; `i` is 0; the current character at position `i` in `s` is "("**
