#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n` where each key `i` maps to the cumulative balance of parentheses up to index `i-1` in `s`. The final value `d[n]` is `0` since `s` is balanced.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: the string `ans` is equal to the original string `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string 's' which is equal to the original string 'ans'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence. The function returns the string `s` unchanged.
