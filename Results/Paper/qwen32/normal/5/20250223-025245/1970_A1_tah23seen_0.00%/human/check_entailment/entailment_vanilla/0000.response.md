Let's analyze the provided Python program to see if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input, which represents the parentheses sequence.
   - This string is then passed to the function `func_1`.

2. **Balance Calculation:**
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `d` is used to store the prefix balance at each position.
   - `d[0]` is initialized to `0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `'('`, it increments the balance by `1`.
     - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the balance by `1`.
   - The balance at each position is stored in `d` with the position as the key (1-indexed).

3. **Removing the Last Balance:**
   - After calculating the balance for all positions, the entry for the last position (`d[n]`) is removed. This is because the problem specifies that we consider the balance of the prefix before each character, not including the character itself.

4. **Sorting:**
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the balance values (increasing order) and, in case of ties, the positions (decreasing order). This is done using the `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key.
   - The lambda function `lambda x: x[1]` sorts primarily by the balance (second element of the tuple), and the default behavior of `sorted` (which is stable) ensures that ties are broken by the position (first element of the tuple) in decreasing order.

5. **Reconstructing the Sequence:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list of tuples `(i, j)` (position, balance) and appends the character at position `i` from the original string `s` to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The resulting string `ans` is returned and printed.

### Evaluation of the Program:

- **Correctness of Balance Calculation:**
  - The balance calculation appears to be correct. For each position in the string, the balance is computed correctly based on the previous balance and the current character.

- **Sorting Logic:**
  - The sorting logic correctly implements the requirements: sorting by balance in increasing order and breaking ties by position in decreasing order.

- **Reconstruction:**
  - The reconstruction of the sequence from the sorted positions is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the prefix balances, sorts them according to the specified criteria, and reconstructs the balanced shuffle sequence.

**Correctness: True**
