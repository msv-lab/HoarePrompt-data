Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the prefix balance for each position in the string `s`, sorts the positions based on the prefix balance (and position in case of ties), and then constructs the new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from `s` in the sorted order. However, there is a mistake in the sorting criteria and the way the result is constructed. The sorting should be done in increasing order of prefix balance and breaking ties in decreasing order of position, but the provided code sorts only by prefix balance. Additionally, the comment stating that "the string `ans` is equal to the original string `s`" is incorrect, as the intention is to construct a new balanced shuffled string, not return the original string.

The correct approach involves sorting the positions of the parentheses based on the specified criteria and then constructing the new string accordingly. The provided code does not achieve this, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
