### Reasoning:

The program reads the input and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' (facing up) coins. The decision on who will win the game is based on whether the count of 'U' coins is odd or even.

The key insight in the problem is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because each player's turn removes one facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins, which can be analyzed in terms of parity.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' coins for each test case and printing "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if it is even.
