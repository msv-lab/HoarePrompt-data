The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was 5, so the new value of `index` is 7. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` must be greater than 1 and will be decremented by 1; `index` is 7; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`; `s` is `data[6]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[4]`.
