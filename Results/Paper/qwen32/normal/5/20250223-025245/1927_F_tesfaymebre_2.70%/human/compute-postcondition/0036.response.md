Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\). `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w, u, v)`. `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes. `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop. `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements. `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`. `node_u` is `-1`. `node_v` is `-1`. `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)`. `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)`. Additionally, `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`.**
