You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown

The problem asks us to find a simple cycle in a given undirected weighted graph such that the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The program needs to output the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the cycle itself (as a sequence of vertices).

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to read input efficiently.
   - `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and then reads the edges into a dictionary `graph` and a list `edges`.

2. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is done to process the heaviest edges first, which is not necessary for finding the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. However, this does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (also known as Union-Find) data structure is used to detect cycles in the graph. The DSU is initialized with `n + 1` elements (to account for 1-based indexing).
   - As edges are processed, the DSU is used to check if adding an edge would form a cycle. If it does, the program records the minimum weight edge in the cycle.

4. **Finding the Cycle:**
   - Once a cycle is detected, the program performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices in the cycle (`node_u`). The DFS is used to reconstruct the cycle.
   - The DFS function `dfs` traverses the graph, marking nodes as visited, and returns the cycle once it encounters a node that has already been visited.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the cycle itself.

### Issues in the Program

1. **DFS Function:**
   - The DFS function `dfs` uses a global variable `graph` which is not defined within the function. This is a major issue because the `graph` variable is local to `func_6`. This will result in a `NameError` when the DFS function tries to access `graph`.
   - The DFS function also uses a global variable `node_v` which is not defined within the function. This is another issue that will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program correctly detects a cycle using the DSU and records the minimum weight edge in the cycle. However, the way the cycle is reconstructed using DFS is problematic. The DFS function does not correctly handle the reconstruction of the cycle because it relies on global variables that are not properly defined.

3. **Edge Sorting:**
   - Sorting edges in descending order based on their weights is not necessary for the problem. The program could simply process the edges in any order and use the DSU to detect cycles and find the minimum weight edge in the cycle.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the DFS function and the reliance on global variables, the program is not correct as it is. The program will not run correctly due to `NameError` issues, and even if these were fixed, the cycle reconstruction might not work as intended.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
