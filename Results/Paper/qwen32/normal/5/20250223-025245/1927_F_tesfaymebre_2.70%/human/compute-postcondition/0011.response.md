Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`. The color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `graph[curr]` must contain at least one neighbor. The neighbor `nei` of `curr` has a color that is not 2, and `nei` is not equal to `parent`. `res` is the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. The condition `res and node_v in set_res` is false, meaning either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.**
