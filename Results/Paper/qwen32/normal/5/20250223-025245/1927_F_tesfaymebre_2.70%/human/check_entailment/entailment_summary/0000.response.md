### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading Functions (1-5):**
   - These functions are responsible for reading input from the standard input. They correctly parse integers, lines, and space-separated values from the input, which is essential for processing each test case.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are correctly implemented to handle different types of input required by the problem.

2. **Main Function (`func_8`):**
   - `func_8` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_6`.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

3. **Graph Construction and DSU (`func_6`):**
   - `func_6` constructs an undirected graph using an adjacency list and a list of edges.
   - It sorts the edges by weight in descending order and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find cycles.
   - The DSU data structure helps identify the minimum edge weight in a cycle by keeping track of the smallest edge weight in each connected component.
   - The function correctly identifies a cycle and the minimum edge weight in that cycle.

4. **Cycle Detection (`dfs` in `func_7`):**
   - The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search to find a cycle containing a specific node (`node_v`).
   - It uses a color array to mark visited nodes and detects cycles by checking if a node has been visited before (`colors[curr] == 1`).
   - The function correctly identifies and returns the path of the cycle if found.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Graph Construction:** The graph is correctly built using adjacency lists, and edges are sorted by weight in descending order.
- **DSU Operations:** The DSU operations (`find` and `union`) are correctly implemented to manage connected components and track the minimum edge weight in each component.
- **Cycle Detection:** The DFS function correctly identifies cycles in the graph and returns the path of the cycle containing the specified node.
- **Output:** The function correctly prints the minimum edge weight, the number of nodes in the cycle, and the nodes themselves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required functionality to find a simple cycle in the graph with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. All functions work together to achieve the desired result as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
