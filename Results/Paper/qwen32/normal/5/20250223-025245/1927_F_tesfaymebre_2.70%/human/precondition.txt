The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m, where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. This is followed by m lines, each containing three integers u, v, and w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6, representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
