To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved.

### Key Points from the Initial State:
1. **Variables `n` and `m`:**
   - `n` and `m` are returned by `func_3()`.
   - They satisfy the condition \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\).

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - `graph` is a `defaultdict` with lists as the default factory, containing all the edges added during the loop.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` representing edges, sorted in descending order by `w`.

3. **Loop and Variables:**
   - The loop runs until `i` equals `m`.
   - In the last iteration, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`.

4. **DSU (Disjoint Set Union):**
   - `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements.
   - It reflects all the unions performed during the loop.

5. **Minimum Edge:**
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight in the final connected component.
   - `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with `_min_edge` weight in the final connected component.

6. **Colors and Result:**
   - `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `0`.
   - `res` is the result returned by the `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` function.

### Understanding `dfs(node_u, -1, [])`:
- The `dfs` function likely performs a depth-first search starting from `node_u`, avoiding the parent node `-1`, and building a path or result list.
- The result `res` is the path or result obtained from this DFS traversal.

### Output of `print(*res)`:
- The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, separated by spaces.

### Detailed Explanation:
- `res` is the result of a DFS traversal starting from `node_u` in the graph.
- The exact elements of `res` depend on the structure of the graph and the specific DFS traversal path.
- Since the exact graph and the DFS traversal details are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `res`.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the result of the DFS traversal starting from node_u in the graph)**
