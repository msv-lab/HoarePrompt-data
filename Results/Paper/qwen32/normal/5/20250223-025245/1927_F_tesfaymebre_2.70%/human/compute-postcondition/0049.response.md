To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `w`, `u`, and `v`. These variables are assigned from the tuples in the `edges` list during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `edges` contains at least one tuple `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`, and these values have been unpacked into `w`, `u`, and `v`. For the next iteration, the next tuple in the `edges` list will be unpacked into these variables.

Let's assume the current tuple being processed is `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`. After processing this tuple, the next tuple in the list will be `(w_next_next, u_next_next, v_next_next)`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `w`, `u`, and `v` will be assigned the values of `w_next_next`, `u_next_next`, and `v_next_next` respectively.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next_next, u_next_next, v_next_next)`; `u` is `u_next_next`; `v` is `v_next_next`; `w` is `w_next_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` before the union operation; `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)` before the union operation; the union operation has been performed on `u` and `v` with weight `w` in the `dsu` structure. If `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v`, the union operation was not performed, and the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `_min_edge` is `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`.**
