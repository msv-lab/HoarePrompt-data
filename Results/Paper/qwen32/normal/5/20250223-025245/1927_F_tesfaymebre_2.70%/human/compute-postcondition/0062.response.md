To determine the output of the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Structures**:
   - `n` and `m` are values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\).
   - `graph` is a defaultdict of lists containing all edges added during the loop.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` representing edge weights and their corresponding nodes, sorted in descending order by `w`.
   - `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes.
   - `u`, `v`, and `w` are values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop.
   - `dsu` is an instance of the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class initialized with `n + 1` elements, reflecting all unions performed during the loop.
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight in the final connected component.
   - `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with `_min_edge` weight in the final connected component.
   - `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `0`.
   - `res` is the result returned by the `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` function, which likely contains nodes visited during a depth-first search starting from `node_u`.

2. **Understanding `_min_edge`**:
   - `_min_edge` is the smallest edge weight in the final connected component of the graph. This means it is the smallest `w` in the `edges` list that connects nodes in the same connected component as determined by the DSU structure.

3. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is the result of a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `node_u`. The DFS visits all nodes reachable from `node_u` in the graph, and `res` contains these nodes. The length of `res` (`len(res)`) represents the number of nodes in the connected component that includes `node_u`.

Based on this understanding, the output of the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement will be:

- `_min_edge`: The smallest edge weight in the final connected component of the graph.
- `len(res)`: The number of nodes in the connected component that includes `node_u`.

Since the exact values of `_min_edge` and the number of nodes in the connected component are not explicitly provided, we can only describe them in terms of the given information.

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight in the final connected component, and len(res) is the number of nodes in the connected component that includes node_u)**
