To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of `func_6()` on the existing variables. However, the provided code snippet does not specify what `func_6()` does. Since the function's behavior is not defined, we can only make assumptions based on the given information.

Given:
- Initial State: `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` minus 2, and must be between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).

The code snippet:
```
func_6()
```

Since `func_6()` does not affect `test_cases` directly in the given code and no other variables are mentioned, we assume `func_6()` does not modify `test_cases` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` minus 2, and must be between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).**
