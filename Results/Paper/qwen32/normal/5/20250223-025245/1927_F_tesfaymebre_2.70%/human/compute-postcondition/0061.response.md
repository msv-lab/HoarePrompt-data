Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains all the edges added during the loop; `edges` is a list containing all the tuples `(w, u, v)` added during the loop, sorted in descending order by `w`; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and reflects all the unions performed during the loop; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight in the final connected component; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with `_min_edge` weight in the final connected component; `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `0`; `res` is the result returned by the `dfs(node_u, -1, [])` function.** 

In simpler terms, the state remains largely the same with the addition of the `res` variable, which holds the result of the depth-first search starting from `node_u`. All other variables retain their previous values and meanings.
