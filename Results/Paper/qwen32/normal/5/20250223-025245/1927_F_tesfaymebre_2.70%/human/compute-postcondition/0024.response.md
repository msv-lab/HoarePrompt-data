Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` after the previously processed neighbor. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. `set_res` is a set containing unique elements from `res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, the function does not perform any additional actions and does not return anything.**
