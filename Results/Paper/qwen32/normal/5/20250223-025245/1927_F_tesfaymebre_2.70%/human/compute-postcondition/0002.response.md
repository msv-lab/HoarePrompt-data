Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must be between 1 and 10^4. The function `func_6()` has been executed, but it does not modify `test_cases` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.**

Natural Language: The value of `test_cases` remains the same as it was initially, which is the value returned by `func_1()` and is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4. No changes have been made to `test_cases` or any other variables by the execution of `func_6()`.
