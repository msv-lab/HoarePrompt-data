Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, where 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `test_cases` is updated to hold the value returned by the function `func_1()`. The precondition that `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4 remains valid, as it is assumed that `func_1()` returns a value within this range.
