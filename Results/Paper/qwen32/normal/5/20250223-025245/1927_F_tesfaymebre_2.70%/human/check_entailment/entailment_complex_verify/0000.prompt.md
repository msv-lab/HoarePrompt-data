You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

The function does not return any specific value and the final state is determined by the side effects of `func_6()`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph such that the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The graph is guaranteed to have at least one cycle.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Cycle Detection**: The program should be able to detect a cycle in the graph.
2. **Minimum Weight Edge in Cycle**: The detected cycle should have the lightest edge with the minimal weight.
3. **Traversal Order**: The vertices of the cycle should be printed in traversal order.

#### Code Review:
- **DSU (Disjoint Set Union) Implementation**: The code uses DSU to detect cycles. It keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
- **Cycle Detection**: The program attempts to detect cycles by checking if two vertices are in the same connected component.
- **Cycle Construction**: Once a cycle is detected, it uses DFS to construct the cycle starting from one of the vertices involved in the cycle.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Sorting Edges in Reverse Order**: The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This may not be optimal for finding the cycle with the minimum weight edge.
2. **Cycle Construction**: The DFS function is supposed to construct the cycle once a cycle is detected, but it might not correctly handle all cases.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program should handle graphs with multiple cycles and ensure that the cycle with the minimum weight edge is found.

### Testing the Program

Let's consider a test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4 5
1 2 10
2 3 8
3 1 5
4 5 100
5 6 40
6 4 3
4 2 5
3 4 7
2 4 1
1 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 4
1 4 2 3
```

**Explanation:**
- The cycle `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1` has the minimum weight edge `1 -> 4` with weight `3`.

However, the provided code has issues:
- The DSU implementation does not correctly maintain the minimum edge weight for the entire cycle.
- The DFS function might not correctly identify the cycle starting from the correct vertex.

### Conclusion

Given the potential issues identified, the program is likely to fail in some cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the detection and construction of the cycle with the minimum weight edge in all cases. The sorting of edges in reverse order and the way the DSU and DFS functions are implemented might lead to incorrect results.
