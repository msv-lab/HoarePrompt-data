Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `graph[curr]` must contain at least one more neighbor, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and if `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `res`, the program returns `res`. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning.**
