The code snippet calls the `dfs` function with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent vertex, and the current path `path`. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `res`. The values of `curr`, `parent`, `path`, and the color of `curr` remain unchanged. The value of `nei` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` after the previously processed neighbor. `res` is the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`.**
