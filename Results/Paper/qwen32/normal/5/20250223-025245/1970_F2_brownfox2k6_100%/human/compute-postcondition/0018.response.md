To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: It is a non-negative integer. The exact value is not specified, so we will refer to it as `t`.
2. **player**: It is a dictionary. The exact contents of this dictionary are not specified, but it's mentioned that it contains player-related information.
3. **blud**: It is a list of two integers. The exact values of these integers are not specified.
4. **out**: It is a list containing at least one player identifier `p`. The exact contents of this list are not specified, but it's mentioned that `out` is sorted.
5. **p**: It is the next value in the sorted `out` list. Since the list is sorted and `p` is the next value, `p` is the smallest player identifier in the `out` list.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
```

We can deduce the following:
- `t` will be printed as it is, a non-negative integer.
- `p` will be printed as the smallest player identifier in the sorted `out` list.
- The string `'ELIMINATED'` will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output will be a combination of the value of `t`, the smallest player identifier `p` from the sorted `out` list, and the string `'ELIMINATED'`.

Output: **t, p, ELIMINATED (where t is a non-negative integer, p is the smallest player identifier in the sorted out list, and 'ELIMINATED' is a string)**
