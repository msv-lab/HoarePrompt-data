### Reasoning:

The provided program and its functions are designed to simulate a Quidditch match based on the problem description. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness with respect to the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field (`N` and `M`).
   - It then reads the field configuration, identifying the positions of red goals (`RG`), blue goals (`BG`), the Quaffle (`Q`), the Bludger (`B`), and players (`R0`, `R1`, ..., `R9`, `B0`, `B1`, ..., `B9`).
   - It initializes scores for both teams (`rs` for red and `bs` for blue) and a variable `carry` to track which player, if any, is carrying the Quaffle.

2. **Processing Actions**:
   - For each action in the input, the program determines the entity performing the action and the type of action.
   - The actions are:
     - **Catch (`C`)**: The player starts carrying the Quaffle.
     - **Throw (`T`)**: The player releases the Quaffle, and the program checks if it was thrown into a goal. If it was, the appropriate team scores a point, and the Quaffle is reset to the center of the field.
     - **Move (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`)**: The entity (either the Bludger, the Quaffle, or a player) moves in the specified direction. If the entity is the Quaffle and a player is carrying it, the Quaffle moves with the player.
     - After a move, the program checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger. If so, the player is eliminated.

3. **Functions**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function updates the coordinates of an entity based on the direction of movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`). This function correctly modifies the position of the entity.
   - **`func_2`**: This function checks for any players that are on the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them. It correctly updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]` and prints the elimination message.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints messages for each goal scored and each player eliminated.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final scores of both teams.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- **Goals**: The program correctly identifies when the Quaffle is thrown into a goal and awards points to the correct team.
- **Eliminations**: The program correctly identifies when a player is on the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them.
- **Movement**: The program correctly updates the positions of all entities based on the actions.
- **Output**: The program prints the required events and the final score in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The program and its functions correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. All actions are handled appropriately, and the output matches the expected format and content.

**Correctness: True**
