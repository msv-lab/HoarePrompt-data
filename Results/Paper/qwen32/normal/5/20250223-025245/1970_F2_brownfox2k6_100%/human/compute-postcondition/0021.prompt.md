Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where `player[p]` is `[-1, -1]` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud` at any point during the loop, otherwise `player[p]` remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing the values of all player identifiers `p` for which `player[p]` was equal to `blud`.
Code of the loop:
for p in sorted(out):
    print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary, `blud` is a list of two integers, and `out` is a list containing at least one player identifier `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary, `blud` is a list of two integers, and `out` is a list containing at least one player identifier `p`. The value of `p` is the next value in the sorted `out` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary, `blud` is a list of two integers, and `out` is a list containing at least two player identifiers where the next value after `p` in the sorted list is the new value of `p`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
