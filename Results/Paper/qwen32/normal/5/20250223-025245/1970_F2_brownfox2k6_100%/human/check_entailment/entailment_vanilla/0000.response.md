Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the given program is correct.

### Code Analysis

The provided code includes two functions:
1. `func_1(obj, d)`: This function updates the position of an object (`obj`) based on the direction (`d`). It correctly handles the four possible directions (U, D, L, R) by adjusting the coordinates of the object.
2. `func_2(t)`: This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger (`blud`). If a player is found on the Bludger's cell, the player is marked as eliminated by setting their position to `[-1, -1]` and the event is printed.

### Missing Functionality

The provided code does not include the following critical functionalities:
1. **Initialization of the Field and Entities**: There is no initialization code that reads the field and sets up the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
2. **Processing of Actions**: The code does not include a mechanism to process the list of actions that describe the game.
3. **Scoring**: There is no code that checks if the Quaffle has been thrown into a goal and updates the score accordingly.
4. **Final Score Output**: The code does not print the final score at the end of the game.

### Correctness

Given the above points, the provided code is incomplete and does not meet all the requirements specified in the problem description. It only includes two functions that handle the movement of an object and the elimination of players by the Bludger. The rest of the game logic, including the initialization, processing of actions, scoring, and final score output, is missing.

Therefore, the program as provided is not correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
