The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`. The condition described in the initial state does not affect the execution of this print statement because the print statement is executed regardless of the values of these variables.

Given the initial state, the only relevant piece of information for the print statement is the string 'YES' itself, which is explicitly provided.

Output: **YES**
