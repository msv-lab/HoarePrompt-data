The code snippet `n = int(input())` will assign a new value to `n` based on the user input, converting that input to an integer. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `s`, and `cnt1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; `cnt1` remains unchanged**.
