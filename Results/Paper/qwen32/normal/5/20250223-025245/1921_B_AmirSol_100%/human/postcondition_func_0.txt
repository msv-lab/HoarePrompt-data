The function accepts an integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (to be added as `cats_to_add`) and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (to be removed as `cats_to_remove`). It returns the maximum of these two values.
