Postcondition: **`s` is a string containing characters 'a' to 'z' in the order they were matched with `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` includes 'b' at the end, `char_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `char_count[1]` is incremented by 1, `char_count[2]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is 2, with the most internal loop or if statement being exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s`, `char_count`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.**
