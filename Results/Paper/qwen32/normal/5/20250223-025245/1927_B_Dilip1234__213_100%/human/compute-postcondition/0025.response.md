The `break` statement will terminate the current loop, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `s`, `char_count`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing characters 'a' to 'z' in the order they were matched with `a[i]` and now also includes 'a' at the end; `char_count[0]` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i`; `j` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
