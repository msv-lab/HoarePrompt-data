The given code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value at the index `j` of the list `char_count` by 1. However, the variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code will raise a `NameError` because `j` is not recognized. Since the code does not execute successfully due to the undefined variable, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza', `char_count` is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `i` is 26, `n` is 26**
