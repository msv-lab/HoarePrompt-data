The code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, this means `char_count[2]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing characters 'a' to 'z' in the order they were matched with `a[i]` plus 'c', `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` includes 'b' at the end, `char_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `char_count[1]` is incremented by 1, `char_count[2]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is still greater than `i`, and `j` is 2, with the most internal loop or if statement being exited.**

Natural language: The value of `char_count[2]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
