In the given task, the initial state describes the values and constraints of the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the provided print statement. The print statement is a simple `print('No')`, which directly outputs the string 'No' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
3. The condition `n < m` is given, but it does not affect the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```
This statement simply prints the string 'No'.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`, the output will always be 'No'.

Output: **No**
