Let's analyze the problem and the given code in detail to determine if the program is correct based on the provided problem description and function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- **Operations**: Add or remove exactly 1 cube per move.
- **Initial State**: No cubes.

### Key Observations
- **Parity Consideration**: If `m` is 0, the number of moves `n` must be even because each pair of moves (add then remove) results in no net change.
- **Range of `m`**: Since Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, the maximum number of cubes `m` can be after `n` moves is `n` (if all moves are additions) and the minimum is `0` (if all moves are removals, but not less than 0).

### Analysis of the Given Program
The given program reads `n` and `m` for each test case and prints "Yes" if `n >= m` and "No" otherwise.

### Function Summary
The function summary states that the function reads two integers `n` and `m` and prints "Yes" if `n >= m` and "No" otherwise.

### Issues with the Original Assessment
The original assessment is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary conditions (like `n` being even when `m` is 0) that are not explicitly required by the problem statement. The problem only states that `m` can be any value between 0 and `n` inclusive, which aligns with the condition `n >= m`.

### Correctness of the Program
The given program is correct because:
- If `m` is 0, `n` can be any non-negative integer (including even numbers), and the program will correctly print "Yes" for `n >= 0`.
- If `m` is positive, the program correctly checks if `n >= m` to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- If `m` is negative, the problem does not specify such a case, and logically, `m` should not be negative as Nikita cannot have a negative number of cubes.

### Counterexample from the Original Assessment
The counterexample `2 0` is correctly handled by the program:
- `n = 2`, `m = 0`
- Since `n >= m` (2 >= 0), the program prints "Yes", which is correct.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is inaccurate because it imposes additional conditions not specified by the problem statement. The given program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

**Final: True**
