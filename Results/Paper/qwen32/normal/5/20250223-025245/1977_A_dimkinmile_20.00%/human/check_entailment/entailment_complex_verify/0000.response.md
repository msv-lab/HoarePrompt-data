Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the annotated version to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add one cube or remove one cube.
- We need to output "Yes" if it's possible and "No" otherwise.

### Provided Program
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Annotated Code
The annotations provide a step-by-step description of the program's behavior, which aligns with the code:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No".

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect and provides a counterexample:
- Input: `2 0`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add a cube and then remove it, resulting in 0 cubes)
- Actual Output: `No` (since 2 is not less than 0)

The assessment also mentions that the program fails for cases where `m` is 0 and `n` is even, and for cases where `m` is negative.

### Analysis
Let's re-evaluate the logic:
- If `m` is 0, it is possible to have 0 cubes after `n` moves if `n` is even (since pairs of add and remove operations will result in no net change).
- If `m` is positive, it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves if `n` is at least `m` (since we can add `m` cubes and then remove any extra cubes if `n > m`).
- If `m` is negative, it is not possible because we cannot have a negative number of cubes.

The provided program only checks if `n >= m`, which does not account for the cases where `m` is 0 and `n` is even. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect for these specific cases.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when `m` is 0 and `n` is even.

**Final: False**
