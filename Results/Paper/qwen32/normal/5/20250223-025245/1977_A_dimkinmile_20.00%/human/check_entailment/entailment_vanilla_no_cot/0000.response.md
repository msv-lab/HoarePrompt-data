Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. It only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, but this does not account for the possibility of removing cubes.

To solve the problem, we need to consider that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change in the number of cubes. If the difference is odd, it is impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This program checks both conditions: whether `n` is at least `m` and whether the difference `(n - m)` is even.
