You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1

        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and n is an integer initialized to 0, ans is an integer initialized to 0. The relationship is that n counts the number of '1's encountered in the string s up to the current index, and ans accumulates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0'.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: ans is the sum of (n + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0', and n is 0.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a binary string `s` and calculates an accumulated cost `ans` based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0' in the string. It then prints the final accumulated cost.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not have any parameters and thus no preconditions based on its signature.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t is 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input an integer `t`, and then calls `func_1` a total of `t` times. The function does not return any value and its final state is determined by the actions performed within `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Analysis of the Program

The problem requires us to compute the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring is the length of that substring.

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a single binary string, computes the minimum cost to sort it, and prints the result.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

#### Function `func_1()`

Here is the function `func_1()` in detail:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```
This function iterates through the string `s`. It keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far in the variable `n`. Whenever it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the answer `ans`.

### Correctness of the Program

Let's analyze whether this logic correctly computes the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

The key observation here is that the cost to sort the string can be computed by counting the number of '1's encountered before each '0' and summing up the costs accordingly. Specifically, for each '0' encountered after some '1's, the cost to move those '1's before the '0' is the number of '1's plus one (the length of the substring involved in the cyclic shift).

Let's consider the example cases provided in the problem description:

1. **Input:** `10`
   - `n` becomes 1 when encountering the first '1'.
   - When encountering the '0', `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - No '1's are encountered, so `ans` remains 0.
   - **Output:** `0` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - `n` becomes 2 when encountering the first two '1's.
   - When encountering the first '0', `ans` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the second '0', `ans` becomes `3 + 3 = 6`.
   - When encountering the third '0', `ans` becomes `6 + 3 = 9`.
   - **Output:** `9` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - `n` becomes 1 when encountering the first '1'.
   - When encountering the first '0', `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` becomes 2 when encountering the second '1'.
   - When encountering the second '0', `ans` becomes `2 + 3 = 5`.
   - `n` becomes 3 when encountering the third '1'.
   - `n` becomes 4 when encountering the fourth '1'.
   - When encountering the third '0', `ans` becomes `5 + 5 = 10`.
   - When encountering the fourth '0', `ans` becomes `10 + 5 = 15`.
   - **Output:** `15` (Incorrect, should be `5`)

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - `n` becomes 1 when encountering the first '1'.
   - When encountering the first '0', `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` becomes 2 when encountering the second '1'.
   - `n` becomes 3 when encountering the third '1'.
   - When encountering the second '0', `ans` becomes `2 + 4 = 6`.
   - `n` becomes 4 when encountering the fourth '1'.
   - When encountering the third '0', `ans` becomes `6 + 5 = 11`.
   - When encountering the fourth '0', `ans` becomes `11 + 5 = 16`.
   - **Output:** `16` (Incorrect, should be `11`)

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for some test cases. Specifically, it overestimates the cost in cases where multiple '0's are encountered after multiple '1's.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle all cases correctly, as demonstrated by the incorrect outputs for the test cases `101011` and `01101001`.
