To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given information and the behavior of the loop.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```
This means the loop will execute `t` times.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `t` must be greater than 0.
- After 2 iterations: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- After 3 iterations: `t` is 2.

This implies that `t` is exactly 2, because after 3 iterations, `t` is specified to be 2, and the loop would have stopped after 2 iterations if `t` were less than 3.

Therefore, the loop will execute exactly 2 times. After these 2 iterations, the value of `t` will still be 2, as `t` is not modified within the loop body (since `func_1()` does not affect `t` based on the given information).

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is that `t` remains 2.

Output State: **t is 2.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged and is still 2.
