Postcondition: **`s` is a binary string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is '1', then `n` is `initial_n + 1` and `ans` is `initial_ans + initial_n + 2`. If `s[2]` is '0' and `n` is not 0, then `ans` is `initial_ans + initial_n + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `initial_ans + initial_n + 1` and `n` remains `initial_n`.**
