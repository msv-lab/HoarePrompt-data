You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and n is an integer initialized to 0, ans is an integer initialized to 0. The relationship is that n counts the number of '1's encountered in the string s up to the current index, and ans accumulates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0'.

    s = input()

    for i in range(len(s)):

        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: ans is the sum of (n + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0', and n is 0.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function does not have any parameters and thus no preconditions based on its signature.

    t = int(input())

        func_1()
        
    #State: t is 2.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Insight:
The optimal strategy involves transforming the string so that all 0s are moved to the front, and all 1s are moved to the back. The cost can be calculated by counting how many 1s have been encountered before each 0, as each 0 needs to "jump over" all previously encountered 1s to reach the front.

### Detailed Explanation of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is the input binary string.
   - `n` counts the number of 1s encountered so far.
   - `ans` accumulates the total cost.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', increment `n` (count of 1s).
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, add `n + 1` to `ans`. The `+1` accounts for the cost of shifting the substring that includes the current '0' and all preceding 1s.

3. **Output**:
   - The total accumulated cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `10`
- Iteration:
  - `i=0`: `s[0]` is '1', so `n` becomes 1.
  - `i=1`: `s[1]` is '0', and `n` is not zero, so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
- Output: `2`

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string `10` to `01` with a cost of 2.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program handles multiple test cases and correctly computes the cost for each case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
