To determine the output, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variable `ans` is defined.

Initial State:
- `ans` is the sum of `(n + 1)` for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.
- `n` is initialized to 0.

The description indicates that `ans` is dependent on sequences of '1's followed by a '0'. However, no specific string or sequence is provided in the initial state. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that if no such sequence exists (or if the string is not provided), `ans` would remain 0 since there are no sequences to sum up `(n + 1)` for.

Thus, `ans` is 0.

Output: **0**
