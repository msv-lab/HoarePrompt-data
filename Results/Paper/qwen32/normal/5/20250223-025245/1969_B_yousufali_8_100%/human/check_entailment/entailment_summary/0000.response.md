### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Recap:**
- We need to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's).
- The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
- We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

**Function Analysis:**

**Function 1 (`func_1`):**
- This function reads a binary string `s`.
- It initializes two variables: `n` (to count the number of '1's encountered) and `ans` (to accumulate the total cost).
- It iterates through the string `s`:
  - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
  - If it encounters a '0' and `n` (the count of '1's) is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
- Finally, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

**Function 2 (`func_2`):**
- This function reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
- It calls `func_1` `t` times, once for each test case.

**Logic Verification:**
- The key part of the logic is in `func_1`. The algorithm seems to be based on the idea that each '0' encountered after some '1's requires a cost to shift those '1's to the right of the '0'.
- The cost `n + 1` for each '0' after `n` '1's makes sense because it implies shifting the substring of length `n + 1` (including the '0') to place the '0' in the correct position.

**Example Walkthrough:**
- For the input `10`, the function will:
  - Encounter '1', increment `n` to 1.
  - Encounter '0', add `n + 1` (i.e., 2) to `ans`.
  - Output `2`, which is correct (one cyclic shift of the whole string `10 -> 01`).

- For the input `11000`, the function will:
  - Encounter '1', increment `n` to 1.
  - Encounter '1', increment `n` to 2.
  - Encounter '0', add `n + 1` (i.e., 3) to `ans`.
  - Encounter another '0', add `n + 1` (i.e., 3) to `ans`.
  - Encounter another '0', add `n + 1` (i.e., 3) to `ans`.
  - Output `9`, which matches the example.

**Conclusion:**
The provided functions, when used together, seem to correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
