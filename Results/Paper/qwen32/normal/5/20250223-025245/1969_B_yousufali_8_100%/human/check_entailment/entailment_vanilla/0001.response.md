To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Insight:
The optimal strategy involves transforming the string so that all 0s are moved to the front, and all 1s are moved to the back. The cost can be calculated by counting how many 1s have been encountered before each 0, as each 0 needs to "jump over" all previously encountered 1s to reach the front.

### Detailed Explanation of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is the input binary string.
   - `n` counts the number of 1s encountered so far.
   - `ans` accumulates the total cost.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', increment `n` (count of 1s).
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, add `n + 1` to `ans`. The `+1` accounts for the cost of shifting the substring that includes the current '0' and all preceding 1s.

3. **Output**:
   - The total accumulated cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `10`
- Iteration:
  - `i=0`: `s[0]` is '1', so `n` becomes 1.
  - `i=1`: `s[1]` is '0', and `n` is not zero, so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
- Output: `2`

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string `10` to `01` with a cost of 2.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program handles multiple test cases and correctly computes the cost for each case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
