The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which is used to determine the number of iterations the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
