The code snippet modifies the value of `cnt` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and `i`. Here's the breakdown:

- `x` is defined as `n - (i * i - i)`.
- `y` is defined as `i * i`.
- `cnt` is incremented by `x // y + (i > 1)`.
  
Given the initial state, `cnt` is not previously defined, so we assume it's 0 or some initial value that doesn't affect the final output state description. The key part is how `cnt` is updated.

The new value of `cnt` is `cnt + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `cnt` is `cnt + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)`**.

In simpler terms, `cnt` is updated by adding the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1 if `i` is greater than 1. All other variables retain their initial state except for `cnt`.
