### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). 

The given code uses two functions:
- **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **func_2(n, m)**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the conditions given in the problem.

However, the implementation of `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The formula used in `func_2` does not match the problem's requirements. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Condition Analysis**:
   - We need to check for each pair \((a, b)\) if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This means \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The implementation in `func_2` uses a formula that involves summing up terms based on \(n\) and \(m\). However, this formula does not directly address the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
   - The formula `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` does not correctly map to the problem's requirement of counting valid pairs.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
   - Alternatively, a more optimized solution might involve mathematical insights or properties to reduce the number of checks.

Given that the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
