The code assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `y`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state, so it does not change further in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`**.
