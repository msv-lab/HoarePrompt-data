Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`; `greater_count` is 0; the current value of `value` is greater than `favorite_value`.**
