Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `f`, `k` <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    same_value_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value == favorite_value:
            same_value_count += 1
    greater_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value > favorite_value:
            greater_count += 1
    if greater_count >= k:
        print('YES')
    elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`; `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition holds as stated. Otherwise, `greater_count` is less than `k`. If the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition holds as stated. Otherwise, `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 999; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`; `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `greater_count` is less than `k`, and `greater_count + same_value_count` is either less than or equal to `k` or greater than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 999; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least `n` elements; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`; `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, `greater_count` is less than `k`, and if the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is greater than `k`, then the condition in the else part holds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
