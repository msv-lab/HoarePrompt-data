Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 999; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`. If the current value of `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 2. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0. `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `greater_count` is less than `k`, and `greater_count + same_value_count` is either less than or equal to `k` or greater than `k`.**
