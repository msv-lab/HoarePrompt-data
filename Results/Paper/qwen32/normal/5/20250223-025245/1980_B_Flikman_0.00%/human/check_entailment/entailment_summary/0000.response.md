### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left based on the sorting and removal process described.

Here's a breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`.

2. **Identifying the Favorite Cube:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is determined by `a[f - 1]` since Python uses zero-based indexing.

3. **Counting Values Greater Than and Equal to the Favorite Cube:**
   - The program counts the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the favorite value (`greater_count`).
   - It also counts the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the favorite value (`same_value_count`).

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `greater_count` is at least `k`, it means there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube, so the favorite cube will definitely be removed. The program prints 'YES'.
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it means the total number of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`, so the favorite cube will definitely not be removed. The program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on the exact order of cubes with the same value. The program prints 'MAYBE'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome based on the provided conditions.
