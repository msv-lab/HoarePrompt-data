The code increments the variable `same_value_count` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `same_value_count` is 1; the current `value` is equal to `favorite_value`.**
