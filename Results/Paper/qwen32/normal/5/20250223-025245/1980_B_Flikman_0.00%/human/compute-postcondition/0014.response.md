Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`. If the current `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 3. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 2; `value` is the next element in the list `a`.**

In simple terms, the value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. If `value` was equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is now 3; otherwise, it is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
