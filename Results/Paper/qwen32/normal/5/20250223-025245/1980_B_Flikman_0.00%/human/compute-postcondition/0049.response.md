Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 999, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 2; otherwise, `same_value_count` is 1. `greater_count` is undefined, `value` is the next element in the list `a`.**
