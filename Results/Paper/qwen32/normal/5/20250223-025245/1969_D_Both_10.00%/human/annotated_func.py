#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, as indicated by the function signature `def func_1():`. Therefore, there are no variables or relationships to describe.
def func_1():
    return int(putin())
    #The program returns an integer value from `putin()`, but `putin()` is not defined, which would result in a NameError in a real execution environment.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and attempts to return an integer value from the `putin()` function, which is not defined, leading to a NameError if executed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature, thus no precondition can be derived from the provided function `func_2`.
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the int function to each element of the list obtained by splitting the input string from putin().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar and sec_arr are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. main_ar and sec_arr are expected to be structured such that each tuple in main_ar and sec_arr corresponds to an item's prices for Alice and Bob, respectively.
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
        
    #State: `main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: `sub_summ` is the initial `sub_summ` plus the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all tuples `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the initial `sub_summ` plus the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all tuples `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers. It calculates a sum, `sub_summ`, by adding the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and then adding the sum of the two integers in each tuple of `main_ar` only if that sum is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns the final calculated sum, `sub_summ`.
