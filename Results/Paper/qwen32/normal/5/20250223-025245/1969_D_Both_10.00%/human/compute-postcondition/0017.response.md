Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, `sub_summ` is the previous `sub_summ` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0`, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.**
