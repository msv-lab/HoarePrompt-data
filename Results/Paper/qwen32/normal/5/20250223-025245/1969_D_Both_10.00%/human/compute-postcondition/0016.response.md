The code provided modifies the value of `sub_summ` by adding `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to it. The initial state specifies that `sub_summ` is already calculated as the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. The code does not check this condition again; it simply adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ`.

Given this, the new value of `sub_summ` will be its previous value plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the previous `sub_summ` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.**
