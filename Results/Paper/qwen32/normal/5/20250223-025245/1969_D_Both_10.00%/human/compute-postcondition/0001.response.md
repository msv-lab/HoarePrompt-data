The only object in the loop head is the variable `val_a` and the list `sec_arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. The state of `main_ar` and `sub_summ` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `sec_arr` must contain at least one tuple. The variable `val_a` will be the first tuple in `sec_arr` during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sub_summ` is 0, `val_a` is the first tuple in `sec_arr`**
