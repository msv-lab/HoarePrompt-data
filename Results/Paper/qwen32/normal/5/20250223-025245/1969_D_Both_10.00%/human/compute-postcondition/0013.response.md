The code snippet adds the first and second elements of the tuple `val_b` to `sub_summ`. Given the initial state, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, and `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.

After executing the code, `sub_summ` will be updated to include the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b`.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.**
