The only object in the loop head is the variable `val_a`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has more than one tuple, the loop will execute again for the next tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, and `val_a` is the first tuple in `sec_arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least 2 tuples, and `val_a` will be the second tuple in `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`**
