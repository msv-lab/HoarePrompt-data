Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 1; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`; `c` is a list containing `a[i]`; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is greater than 10; `y` is greater than `x`.**

Natural language: The value of `n` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
