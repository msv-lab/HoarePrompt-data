Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Digit Splitting**: The program attempts to split numbers greater than 10 by taking the remainder (`x = a[i] % 10`) and the quotient (`y = a[i] / 10`). However, this approach does not correctly handle numbers with more than two digits (e.g., 100, 123, etc.). The correct approach would be to convert the number to a string and then split it into individual digits.

2. **Incorrect Insertion Logic**: The program tries to insert the digits into the list `c` based on some conditions that do not accurately reflect the problem requirements. Specifically, the conditions for inserting digits (`if y >= c[n - 1]` and `if y <= x`) are not appropriate for ensuring that the array can be sorted.

3. **Initial Sorting Check**: The program checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing, but it does not account for the fact that the array can be sorted by performing the operation multiple times, not just once. The program should simulate the process of splitting numbers and check if the array can be made sorted through multiple operations.

4. **Logical Errors in Conditions**: The conditions used in the program to decide whether to split a number and how to insert the digits are flawed. The program does not correctly handle cases where splitting a number could lead to a sorted array.

To fix the program, you would need to implement a more robust algorithm that correctly simulates the process of splitting numbers and checks if the array can be sorted through multiple operations. This would likely involve a more complex approach, such as using a backtracking algorithm or a dynamic programming approach, to explore all possible ways of splitting numbers and checking if a sorted array can be achieved.
