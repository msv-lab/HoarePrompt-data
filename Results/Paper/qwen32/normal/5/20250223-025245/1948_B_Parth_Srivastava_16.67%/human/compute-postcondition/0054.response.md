Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is 2 or 4 based on the initial value of `n`; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list containing `a[i]` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 1 or greater than 1 and `a[i]` is greater than 10. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` is 2, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` is 4, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` and less than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so if `n` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `n` was initially 3, it becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
