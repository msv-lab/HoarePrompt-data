The code snippet `n = n + 2` increments the value of `n` by 2. Given the initial state where `n` is 1, after the execution of the code, `n` will be 3. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 3; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list containing the integers `y` and `x`; `i` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10; the integer division `y` of `a[i]` by 10 is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` (which is `y` itself) and less than or equal to `x`.**
