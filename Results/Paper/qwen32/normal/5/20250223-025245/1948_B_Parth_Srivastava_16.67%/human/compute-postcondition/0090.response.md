Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `k`, followed by a list of integers `a`. It processes the list `a` by potentially splitting certain elements and then checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted. It appends `1` to a list `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`. The function does not explicitly return a value but modifies the list `b` based on the sorted state of `c`.**
