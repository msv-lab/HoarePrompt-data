The value of `x` is updated to be the integer remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10. Since `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` will be a single digit integer between 0 and 9. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `y`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is 0; `c` is an empty list; `i` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10**
