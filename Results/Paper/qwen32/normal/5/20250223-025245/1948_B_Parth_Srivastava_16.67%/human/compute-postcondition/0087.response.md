The code snippet provided only appends the value `0` to the list `b`. No other variables are modified in the code snippet. Therefore, the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `c`, and `d` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is the total number of elements in `c` after the loop; `a` is a list of integers; `k` is an input integer; `x` and `y` are the last computed values; `c` is a list of integers modified based on the loop conditions; `d` is a sorted version of `c`; `c` is not equal to `d`; `b` has an additional element `0` appended to it.**
