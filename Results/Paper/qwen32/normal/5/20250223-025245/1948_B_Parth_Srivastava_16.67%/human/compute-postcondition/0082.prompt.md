Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is 1, 2, or 3 based on the conditions; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10` if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)` if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `y` is 0; `c` is a list containing either `a[i]` if `y > x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y <= x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, or `c` is a list containing `a[i]` if `i` is 0 or `a[i]` is not greater than 10; `i` is 0 or greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` is 1, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` is 3, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` and less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 based on the conditions; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10` if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)` if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `y` is 0; `c` is a list that contains either `a[i]` if `y > x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y <= x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, or `c` is a list containing `a[i]` if `i` is 0 or `a[i]` is not greater than 10, or `c` includes `x` as an additional element if `y <= x`. `i` is 1 or greater than 1 and `a[i]` is greater than 10. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` is 1, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` is 3, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` and less than or equal to `x`. If `y >= c[n - 2]` and `n` is 2, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y >= c[n - 2]` and `n` is 4, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 2]` and less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an integer ranging from 1 to 7 based on the conditions; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10` if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)` if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `y` is 0; `c` is a list that contains either `a[i]` if `y > x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y <= x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, or `c` is a list containing `a[i]` if `i` is 0 or `a[i]` is not greater than 10, or `c` includes `x` as an additional element if `y <= x`. If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, and `y >= c[n - 1]`, `c` includes `a[i]` as an additional element. If `y <= x`, `c` also includes `y` and `x` as additional elements. If `y < c[n - 1]`, no changes are made to `c`. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, `c` also includes `x` as an additional element if `y <= x`. `i` is 2 or greater than 2 and `a[i]` is greater than 10 if the if condition is met, otherwise `i` is 2 or greater than 2 and `a[i]` is greater than 10 or `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10` if the else condition is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
