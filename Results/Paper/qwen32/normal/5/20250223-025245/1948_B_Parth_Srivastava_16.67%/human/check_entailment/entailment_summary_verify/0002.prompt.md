You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `k`, followed by a list of integers `a`. It processes the list `a` by potentially splitting certain elements and then checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted. It appends `1` to a list `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`. The function does not explicitly return a value but modifies the list `b` based on the sorted state of `c`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Program Structure and Logic Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and determine if the array can be sorted by the given operation.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (`func_1`):**
   - Reads the number of elements `k` and the array `a`.
   - Converts the array elements into integers.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified array.
   - Iterates through each element of the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10, it checks if the digits can be split and inserted while maintaining the non-decreasing order.
     - If the element is not greater than 10, it simply appends it to the list `c`.
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted.
   - Appends `1` to list `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise appends `0`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints "YES" for each test case where `b[i]` is 1, and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The program incorrectly splits numbers and checks conditions. For example, when splitting a number like `28`, it should split into `2` and `8`, but the current logic might not handle all cases correctly.
   - The logic for checking if digits can be inserted while maintaining the order is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the digits of the split number need to be inserted in a way that maintains the overall order.

2. **Handling of Leading Digits:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the first element is greater than 10. It should ensure that the digits are inserted correctly even if the first element is greater than 10.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The program does not simulate the process of splitting numbers and checking if the array can be sorted. Instead, it tries to directly check if the array can be sorted after some operations, which is not the correct approach.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the logic and approach, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
