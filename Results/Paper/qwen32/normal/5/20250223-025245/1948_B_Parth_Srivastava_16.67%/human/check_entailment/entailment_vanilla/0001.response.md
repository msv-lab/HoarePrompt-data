Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Program Structure and Logic Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and determine if the array can be sorted by the given operation.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (`func_1`):**
   - Reads the number of elements `k` and the array `a`.
   - Converts the array elements into integers.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified array.
   - Iterates through each element of the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10, it checks if the digits can be split and inserted while maintaining the non-decreasing order.
     - If the element is not greater than 10, it simply appends it to the list `c`.
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted.
   - Appends `1` to list `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise appends `0`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints "YES" for each test case where `b[i]` is 1, and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The program incorrectly splits numbers and checks conditions. For example, when splitting a number like `28`, it should split into `2` and `8`, but the current logic might not handle all cases correctly.
   - The logic for checking if digits can be inserted while maintaining the order is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the digits of the split number need to be inserted in a way that maintains the overall order.

2. **Handling of Leading Digits:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the first element is greater than 10. It should ensure that the digits are inserted correctly even if the first element is greater than 10.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The program does not simulate the process of splitting numbers and checking if the array can be sorted. Instead, it tries to directly check if the array can be sorted after some operations, which is not the correct approach.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the logic and approach, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
