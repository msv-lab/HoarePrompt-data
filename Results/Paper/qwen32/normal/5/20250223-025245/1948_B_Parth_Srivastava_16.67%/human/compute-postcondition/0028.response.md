Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 2; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`; `c` is a list containing the integers `y` and `x`; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is greater than 10; and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
