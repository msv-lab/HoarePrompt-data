Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an integer ranging from 2 to 7 based on the conditions; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `i` is 2 or greater than 2 and `a[i]` is greater than 10. If `y <= x`, `c` includes `a[i]` as an additional element, and `c` also includes `y` and `x` as additional elements. Otherwise, `c` includes `a[i]` as an additional element.**
