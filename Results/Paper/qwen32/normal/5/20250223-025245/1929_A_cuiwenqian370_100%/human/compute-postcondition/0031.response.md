The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one element, and `result` is the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements, and `result` should be the second-to-last element (since the last element would have been processed in the previous iteration).

However, since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, `result` should be the next element in the list that will be processed, which is the second element if `result` was the first in the previous iteration.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element in the list**
