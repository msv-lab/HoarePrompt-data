The code reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. The variable `data` is assigned this list of strings. The initial state of `array` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the provided code snippet. The `input` variable still holds the `sys.stdin.read` function, but it is not used further in the provided code.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.**
