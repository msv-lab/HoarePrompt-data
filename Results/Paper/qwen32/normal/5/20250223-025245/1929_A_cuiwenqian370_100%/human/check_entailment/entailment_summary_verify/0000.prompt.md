You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a result using the `func_1` function and prints the result. The overall effect is to process each test case individually and output the corresponding result.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of an array `a` by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).

### Program Analysis:

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- The function sorts the array.
- It then calculates the beauty of the sorted array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the key to achieving the maximum beauty.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- For each test case, it reads the array, calls `func_1` to compute the beauty, and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Analysis:

The approach taken by the program is correct. Sorting the array ensures that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the optimal way to achieve the maximum beauty. Here's why:

- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the smallest element is first, the largest is last, and the intermediate elements are in between. This arrangement maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.
- **Beauty Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements, the program correctly computes the beauty of the array.

### Verification with Example Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: \(|2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: \(|69-69| + |69-69| = 0 + 0 = 0\)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: \(|54-43| + |80-54| + |90-80| + |100-90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: \(|3-3| + |3-3| + |4-3| = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: \(|2-1| = 1\)

All the example cases are handled correctly by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since it handles all the provided example cases correctly and the logic is sound, we can conclude that the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**.
