The code snippet provided is:
```python
result = func_1(array)
```

This line of code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `array` and assigns the returned value to the variable `result`.

**Impact on the Program:**
- The variable `result` is updated to the value returned by `func_1(array)`.
- Other variables such as `array`, `input`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.

**Output State:**
- `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer.
- `t` is 1.
- `index` is `index + 1 + n`.
- `results` is a list containing `result`.
- `n` is `int(data[index])`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `index` is `index + 1 + n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(array)`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.
