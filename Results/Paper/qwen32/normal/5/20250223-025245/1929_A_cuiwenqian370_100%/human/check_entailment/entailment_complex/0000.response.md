### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array. By sorting the array, we can ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the maximum difference between any two elements is obtained when they are placed at the extremes of the sorted array.

Let's break down the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
    - **Input**: An array of integers.
    - **Process**: Sorts the array, then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
    - **Output**: The beauty of the array, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
    - **Correctness**: This function correctly computes the beauty of the array when the array is sorted. Sorting ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the problem's goal.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - **Input**: Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
    - **Process**: For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of `n` integers. It then calls `func_1(array)` to compute the beauty of the array and stores the result.
    - **Output**: Prints the beauty of each test case.
    - **Correctness**: This function correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the input, calling `func_1(array)` for each test case, and printing the results.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly solve the problem by sorting the array and calculating the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. The provided functions handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
