The code snippet assigns the value of the second element in the `data` list (which is `data[index]` where `index` is 1) to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. The value of `n` is now a positive integer representing the length of the `array`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is `int(data[1])`.**
