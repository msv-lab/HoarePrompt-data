Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is 2; `index` is `index + 2 + n + n`; `results` is a list containing three values, the first two being the original `result` values and the third being the value returned by `func_1(array)`; `n` is `int(data[index - n - 2 - n])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**

In simple terms, the `results` list now contains three elements: the two original `result` values and the new value returned by `func_1(array)`. All other variables retain their previous states.
