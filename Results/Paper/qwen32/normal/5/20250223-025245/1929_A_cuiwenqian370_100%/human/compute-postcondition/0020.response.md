The code snippet provided updates the value of `n` by reading the integer value from `data[index]`. This does not affect other variables like `array`, `input`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `results`, `result`, or the function `func_1`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is 2; `index` is `index + 1 + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value at `data[index]`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
