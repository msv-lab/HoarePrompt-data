You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `array` is a sorted list of integers with length `n` such that `n` is at least 2, and each integer in the array satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`; `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array; `i` is `n`.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers, sorts it, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `index + (t - 1) * (1 + n)`; `results` is a list containing `t` values, each being the value returned by `func_1(array)` for each iteration; `n` is `int(data[index - (1 + n) * (t - 1)])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: All elements in the `results` list have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a result using the `func_1` function and prints the result. The overall effect is to process each test case individually and output the corresponding result.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 
The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, where beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. This is because the sum of differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the differences themselves are maximized, which occurs when the array is sorted in one of these orders.

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences are simply the differences (as the array is either non-decreasing or non-increasing). This function correctly calculates the maximum beauty for a given array.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case. It then prints the results.

The logic in both functions is correct and aligns with the problem description. The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by sorting the array and computing the beauty, and outputs the results correctly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
