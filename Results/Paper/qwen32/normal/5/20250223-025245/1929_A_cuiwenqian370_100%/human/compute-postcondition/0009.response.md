The code increments the `index` variable by the value of `n`. Therefore, the new value of `index` will be `index + n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is `int(data[1])`.**
