### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed analysis of the program and its correctness based on the problem description. Let's break down the key points and verify them step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).

#### Program Analysis:

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- **Action**: The function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- **Annotation**: The annotations confirm that the array is sorted and the beauty is calculated correctly as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Logic**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the key to achieving the maximum beauty.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- **Action**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
- **Annotation**: The annotations confirm that the input is read and processed correctly, and the results are stored and printed as expected.
- **Logic**: The logic of reading input and processing each test case is sound and correctly implemented.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - **Explanation**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the smallest element is first, the largest is last, and the intermediate elements are in between. This arrangement maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Verification**: The annotations confirm that the array is sorted before the beauty calculation.

2. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - **Explanation**: By iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements, the program correctly computes the beauty of the array.
   - **Verification**: The annotations confirm that the beauty is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Verification with Example Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - **Input**: `2 1 3`
   - **Sorted**: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - **Beauty**: \(|2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\)
   - **Verification**: Matches the expected output.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - **Input**: `69 69 69`
   - **Sorted**: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - **Beauty**: \(|69-69| + |69-69| = 0 + 0 = 0\)
   - **Verification**: Matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - **Input**: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - **Sorted**: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - **Beauty**: \(|54-43| + |80-54| + |90-80| + |100-90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)
   - **Verification**: Matches the expected output.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - **Input**: `3 4 3 3`
   - **Sorted**: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - **Beauty**: \(|3-3| + |3-3| + |4-3| = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
   - **Verification**: Matches the expected output.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - **Input**: `2 1`
   - **Sorted**: `[1, 2]`
   - **Beauty**: \(|2-1| = 1\)
   - **Verification**: Matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since it handles all the provided example cases correctly and the logic is sound, we can conclude that the program is correct.

**Final: True**.
