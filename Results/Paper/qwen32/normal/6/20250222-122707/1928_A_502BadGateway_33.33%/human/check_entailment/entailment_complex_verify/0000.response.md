Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides, and then form a new rectangle using those two smaller rectangles. The rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

### Key Observations
1. **If either \( a \) or \( b \) is 1**: The rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.
2. **If both \( a \) and \( b \) are greater than 1**: The rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle. This is because:
   - Cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( a \times 1 \) and \( a \times (b-1) \) (or \( b \times 1 \) and \( b \times (a-1) \)).
   - These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \( 1 \times (a \times b) \) or \( (a \times b) \times 1 \), which is different from the original rectangle.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks if \( b \) is even and returns "yes" if it is, otherwise it returns "no". This logic is incorrect for the problem, as discussed in the original assessment.

### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` returns "yes" if \( b \) is even and "no" otherwise. This aligns with the incorrect logic of the program.

### Validation Against the Problem Description
- **Test Case 1**: \( a = 1, b = 1 \)
  - Expected Output: "No" (since neither dimension is greater than 1)
  - Program Output: "No" (since \( b \) is odd)
- **Test Case 2**: \( a = 2, b = 1 \)
  - Expected Output: "No" (since \( b \) is 1)
  - Program Output: "No" (since \( b \) is odd)
- **Test Case 3**: \( a = 2, b = 6 \)
  - Expected Output: "Yes" (since both dimensions are greater than 1)
  - Program Output: "Yes" (since \( b \) is even)
- **Test Case 4**: \( a = 3, b = 2 \)
  - Expected Output: "Yes" (since both dimensions are greater than 1)
  - Program Output: "No" (since \( b \) is even but the logic is incorrect)
- **Test Case 5**: \( a = 2, b = 2 \)
  - Expected Output: "Yes" (since both dimensions are greater than 1)
  - Program Output: "Yes" (since \( b \) is even)
- **Test Case 6**: \( a = 2, b = 4 \)
  - Expected Output: "Yes" (since both dimensions are greater than 1)
  - Program Output: "Yes" (since \( b \) is even)
- **Test Case 7**: \( a = 6, b = 3 \)
  - Expected Output: "No" (since the logic is incorrect)
  - Program Output: "No" (since \( b \) is odd)

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it only checks if \( b \) is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle. The correct logic should check if both \( a \) and \( b \) are greater than 1.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
