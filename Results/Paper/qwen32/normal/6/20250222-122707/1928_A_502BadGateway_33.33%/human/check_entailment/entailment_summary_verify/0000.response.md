Let's analyze the problem and the given program in detail.

**Problem Analysis:**
Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. He then tries to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The key points to consider are:
1. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.
2. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are greater than 1, the rectangle can be cut and rearranged into a different rectangle.

**Given Program:**
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

**Function Summary:**
The function `func_1` returns 'yes' if `b` is even, otherwise it returns 'no'.

**Original Assessment:**
The assessment correctly points out that the provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle. The logic used in the program is insufficient because it only checks if `b` is even, which does not cover all the conditions necessary to solve the problem.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are greater than 1, the rectangle can be cut and rearranged into a different rectangle.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program only checks if `b` is even. This is not a sufficient condition to determine if a different rectangle can be formed.
   - For example, for the input \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), the program would incorrectly return 'no' because `b` is not even. However, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and rearrange them into a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(3 \times 2\) rectangle.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic should check if both \(a\) and \(b\) are greater than 1. If both are greater than 1, Bob can form a different rectangle.

**Conclusion:**
The original assessment is correct. The given program does not correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle of size \(a \times b\). The program's logic is insufficient and incorrect.

**Final:**
Final: **False**
