Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides, and then form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
1. The cut must be parallel to one of the sides.
2. The two resulting rectangles can be rotated and moved as needed.
3. Two rectangles that are 90Â° rotations of each other are considered the same.

From the problem description, we need to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original `a x b` rectangle using the above rules.

### Observations:
- If `a == b`, then the rectangle is a square. Cutting a square results in two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)`, which can only form the same square when rearranged.
- If `a != b`, then:
  - If `b` is even, we can cut the rectangle into two `a x (b/2)` rectangles. These can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a * 2) x (b/2)`, which is different from the original `a x b` rectangle.
  - If `b` is odd, we can cut the rectangle into an `a x (b-1)/2` rectangle and an `a x 1` rectangle. These cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle with integer sides.

### Conclusion:
- The problem boils down to checking if `b` is even. If `b` is even, Bob can form a different rectangle; otherwise, he cannot.

### Program Analysis:
The given program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`. It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)` which checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise.

### Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Evaluation:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. It checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if true, and 'no' if false. This matches the requirements of the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
