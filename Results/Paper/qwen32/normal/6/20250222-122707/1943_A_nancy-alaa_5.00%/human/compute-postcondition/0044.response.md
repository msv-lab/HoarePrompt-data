Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is `False`. The current value of `i` is not a key in `mpp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.
