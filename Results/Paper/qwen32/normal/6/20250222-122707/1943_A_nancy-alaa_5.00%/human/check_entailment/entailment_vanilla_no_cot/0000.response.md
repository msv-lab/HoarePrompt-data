Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the final score of the game based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game has ended, but it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not account for the fact that Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it.

Let's analyze the logic needed for the correct solution:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Count the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using a counter.
2. **Simulate the Game**: Simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Alice will always try to pick a number that will maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to minimize it.
3. **Determine MEX**: After the game is over, determine the MEX of the array `c`.

The correct approach involves understanding that Alice will pick numbers in a way that delays the inclusion of the smallest possible numbers in `c`, while Bob will pick numbers to include the smallest possible numbers as early as possible.

Here is a sketch of the correct approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each number.
2. Determine the smallest number that is not in the array or appears an odd number of times (since Alice can always force the inclusion of such a number in `c`).
3. The MEX will be the smallest such number.

The provided program does not follow this logic and incorrectly attempts to determine the MEX without simulating the game or considering the strategic decisions of the players.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.
