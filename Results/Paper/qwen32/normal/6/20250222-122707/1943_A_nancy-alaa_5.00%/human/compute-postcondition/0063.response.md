Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.
2. `i` is updated to `i + 2`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- We know that `i` is updated to `i + 2`. However, the exact value of `i` before the update is not specified.
- The condition `n > i + 2` ensures that `n` is greater than the new value of `i`.

### Output:
- The print statement will output the updated value of `i`, which is `i + 2`.

Given the initial state, we do not have the exact value of `i` before the update, but we know that the print statement will output the new value of `i` after it has been incremented by 2.

Output: **i + 2 (where i is the original value of i before the update)**
