Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; `i` is incremented by 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` is increased by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables remain unchanged.
