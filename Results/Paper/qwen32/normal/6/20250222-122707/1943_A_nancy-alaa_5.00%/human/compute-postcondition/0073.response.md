The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the input. The other variables `i`, `first`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `first` is `True` if any frequency of `i` in `mpp` was 1 during the iterations, `n` is an input integer, `arr` remains unchanged, `mpp` remains unchanged.**
