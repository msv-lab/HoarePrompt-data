Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the current value of `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In this output state, the value of `first` has been set to `True`, which means the most internal loop or if statement will be broken out of. All other variables retain their initial values.
