Given the initial state, we need to determine the output of the `print(i)` statement. Here's the breakdown:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\).
2. `n` is a positive integer.
3. `arr` is a list of integers.
4. `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
5. `first` is a boolean variable initialized to `False`.
6. `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

The key point here is that `i` is explicitly stated to not be a key in the `mpp` Counter object. However, the initial state does not provide any specific value for `i`. Therefore, `i` could be any value that is not present in `arr`.

Since `i` is not defined with any specific value in the initial state and we only know that it is not a key in `mpp`, the output will simply be the value of `i` as it is.

However, since there's no specific value assigned to `i` in the given information, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `i`. The only thing we know is that it is not present in `arr`.

Given the constraints and the lack of a specific value for `i`, the output will just be `i` itself, which is some value that is not a key in `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is a value not present in arr)**
