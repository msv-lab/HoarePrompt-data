You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines and prints the smallest index `i` that either does not exist in the list `a` or is a unique element that appears after another unique element has been encountered.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX score, respectively. Here are a few issues and potential cases where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to find the MEX by iterating through numbers and checking their presence in the `Counter` object. However, it does not correctly simulate the game where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.

2. **Lack of Simulation of the Game**:
   - The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, which is crucial to determine the final MEX score. Alice and Bob's strategies affect the final composition of the array `c`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Considered**:
   - The code does not handle cases where all elements are the same, or where the array contains elements in a way that forces a specific MEX value.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input**:
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- Alice can pick `1` first, making `c = [1]` and `a = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Bob picks any `0`, making `c = [1]` and `a = [0, 0, 0]`.
- Alice picks another `0`, making `c = [1, 0]` and `a = [0, 0]`.
- Bob picks another `0`, making `c = [1, 0]` and `a = [0]`.
- Alice picks the last `0`, making `c = [1, 0, 0]` and `a = []`.
- The MEX of `[1, 0, 0]` is `2`, but the optimal strategy leads to a MEX of `1`.

The provided code does not simulate this optimal play and thus fails to produce the correct output for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
