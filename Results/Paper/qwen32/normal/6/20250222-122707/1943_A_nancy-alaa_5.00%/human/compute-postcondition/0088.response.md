Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`. If `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues to execute. If `mpp[i]` is not 1, the execution continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
