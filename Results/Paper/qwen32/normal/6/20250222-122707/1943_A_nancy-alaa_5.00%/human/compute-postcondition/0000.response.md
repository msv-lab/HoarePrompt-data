In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. The loop head only involves the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. 

Given this, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`, but since `_` is just an iteration variable and not directly related to the condition of the loop, the primary variable that determines whether the loop executes is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `n` and `a` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, as they are used within the loop body, not in the loop head. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
