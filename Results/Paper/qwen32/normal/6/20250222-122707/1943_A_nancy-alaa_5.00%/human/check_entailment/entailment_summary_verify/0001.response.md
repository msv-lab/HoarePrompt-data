### Reasoning

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, the program's logic is flawed and does not accurately simulate the game or account for the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob.

Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Single Occurrences**:
   - The program checks if a number appears only once and sets a flag `first` to `True`. It then prints the number only if `first` is `True`. This logic does not correctly simulate Alice's and Bob's turns and does not ensure that the smallest missing number is maximized by Alice's optimal play.

2. **Ignoring Bob's Moves**:
   - The program does not account for Bob's moves, which are crucial in determining the final MEX. Bob's strategy is to minimize the MEX, and the program does not simulate this aspect of the game.

3. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the first number appearing only once should be the MEX. This is not necessarily true because Bob can remove this number, and the MEX could be influenced by subsequent moves.

4. **Flawed MEX Determination**:
   - The program checks if a number does not appear in the array and prints it as the MEX. However, this does not account for the fact that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` after all turns, which is influenced by both players' optimal strategies.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game and account for both players' optimal strategies. Here's a brief outline of the correct approach:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.

2. **Simulate the Game**:
   - Alice will try to add numbers to `c` such that the smallest missing number is maximized.
   - Bob will try to remove numbers that would help Alice achieve a higher MEX.

3. **Determine MEX**:
   - Iterate through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` and determine the smallest number that is not present in `c` after all turns.

The provided program does not correctly simulate this process. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the program's flaws.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
