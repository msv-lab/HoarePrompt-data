Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` and `b` are integers. `t` is calculated as `b * 2 // 5` if `b * 2` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the program remains in this state. Otherwise, `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` if `t2` (which is `a - t1`) is divisible by 15, or `t2 // 15 + 1` if not, and `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`.***
