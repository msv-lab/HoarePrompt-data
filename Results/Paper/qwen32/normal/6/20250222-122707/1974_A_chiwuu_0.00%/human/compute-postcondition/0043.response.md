Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0, `t` is `2 * b`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be twice the value of `b`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
