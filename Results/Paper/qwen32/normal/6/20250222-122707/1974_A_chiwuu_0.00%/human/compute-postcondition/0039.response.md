The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was not defined (because the condition `t1 >= a` was not met), which implies that `i` was not incremented in the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be initialized to 0 (since it's the first iteration of the loop). `n` must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `i` is 0**
