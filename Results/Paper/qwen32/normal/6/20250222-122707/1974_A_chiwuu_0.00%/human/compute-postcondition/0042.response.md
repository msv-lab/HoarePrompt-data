The code snippet converts the variable `b` from a string to an integer. This affects the type of `b` but does not change any other variables. Therefore, the new state of `b` is that it is an integer.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0.**
