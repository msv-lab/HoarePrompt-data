To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Screens Needed:**
   - The program first calculates the number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons (`t`).
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen is a 5x3 grid (15 cells), the number of screens required to accommodate `b` 2x2 icons is calculated as:
     - `t = b * 2` (each 2x2 icon occupies a 2x2 block, thus `b * 4` cells, which is equivalent to `b * 2` blocks of 2 cells).
     - `t = t // 5 + (1 if t % 5 != 0 else 0)` (rounding up the number of 5-cell blocks needed).
   - This calculation is correct in terms of the number of screens needed purely for the 2x2 icons.

3. **Accommodating 1x1 Icons:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on the screens are calculated as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, the number of additional screens required for the 1x1 icons is calculated as:
     - `t2 = a - t1` (remaining 1x1 icons to be placed).
     - `t = t + t2 // 15 + (1 if t2 % 15 != 0 else 0)` (rounding up the number of additional screens needed).

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with a few test cases provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case: 1 1**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `t = 1 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icon).
   - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11` (11 cells remaining).
   - `t1 >= a` (11 >= 1), so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

2. **Test Case: 7 2**
   - `a = 7`, `b = 2`
   - `t = 2 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (1 screen for 2x2 icons).
   - `t1 = 15 - 8 = 7` (7 cells remaining).
   - `t1 >= a` (7 >= 7), so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

3. **Test Case: 12 4**
   - `a = 12`, `b = 4`
   - `t = 4 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 2` (2 screens for 2x2 icons).
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 16 = 14` (14 cells remaining).
   - `t1 >= a` (14 >= 12), so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

4. **Test Case: 0 9**
   - `a = 0`, `b = 9`
   - `t = 9 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 4` (4 screens for 2x2 icons).
   - `t1 = 4 * 15 - 36 = 0` (0 cells remaining).
   - `t1 >= a` (0 >= 0), so no additional screens needed.
   - Output: `4` (Incorrect, should be `5`).

### Conclusion

The program seems to correctly handle most cases, but it fails in some edge cases, such as when the number of 2x2 icons requires more than enough screens that there are leftover cells, but the leftover cells are not sufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons without additional screens.

Thus, the program is **not** correct for all test cases.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
