Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99
- `a` and `b` are integers (converted from strings)
- `t` is `b * 2`
- `t` is not divisible by 5

Code:
```
t = t // 5 + 1
```

Impact:
- The value of `t` is updated using integer division by 5 and then incremented by 1.

Since `t` is initially `b * 2` and not divisible by 5, the new value of `t` will be `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`); `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.**

Natural Language:
The value of `t` is updated to be the result of integer division of `b * 2` by 5, plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
