The code snippet calculates the value of `t1` using the formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. The variables `t`, `b`, and `n` are already defined. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` are not affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0, `t` is `(2 * b) // 5` if `(2 * b) % 5 == 0`; otherwise, `t` is `((2 * b) // 5) + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
