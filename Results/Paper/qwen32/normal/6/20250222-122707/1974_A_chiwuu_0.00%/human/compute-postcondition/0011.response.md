Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`); If `t` (which is `b * 2`) is divisible by 5, then `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t1` is now calculated based on the updated value of `t` and the value of `b`. All other variables retain their initial state.
