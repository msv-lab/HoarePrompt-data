### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.

2. **Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - It calculates `t = b * 2`, where `t` represents the total number of 1x1 cells occupied by 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, `b * 4` cells are occupied, but for calculation convenience, it uses `b * 2`).
   - It then calculates the number of screens required to fit these 2x2 icons. If `t % 5 == 0`, it calculates `t = t // 5` (since each screen is 5x3, and 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each, we need to fit them in 5 rows). Otherwise, it calculates `t = t // 5 + 1` to account for the extra screen needed.

3. **Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - It calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the remaining number of 1x1 cells available on the screens already allocated for 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means the remaining cells are enough to fit all 1x1 icons, and no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1 < a`, it calculates `t2 = a - t1`, which is the number of additional 1x1 cells needed.
   - It then calculates the number of additional screens required to fit these `t2` 1x1 cells. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, it adds `t2 // 15` to `t`. Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the total number of screens required.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is incorrect. The calculation `t = b * 2` and subsequent steps do not correctly account for the placement of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells (`t1`) and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons also seems flawed. The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` does not correctly reflect the remaining space on the screens.

### Correct Approach:
- For 2x2 icons, each icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to fit them on a 5x3 grid. The optimal way to fit 2x2 icons is to place them in a way that minimizes the leftover space.
- For 1x1 icons, we need to fill the leftover space after placing 2x2 icons optimally.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. The logic for placing 2x2 icons and calculating the remaining space is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
