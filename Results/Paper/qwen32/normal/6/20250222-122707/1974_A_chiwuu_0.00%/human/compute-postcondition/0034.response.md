Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 â‰¤ `x`, `y` â‰¤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to it. All other variables retain their previously defined states and values.
