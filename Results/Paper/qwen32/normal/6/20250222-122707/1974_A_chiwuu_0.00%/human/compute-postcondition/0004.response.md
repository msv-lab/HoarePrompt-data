The code snippet converts the string `b` to an integer. Therefore, the variable `b` will now hold an integer value instead of a string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`).**
