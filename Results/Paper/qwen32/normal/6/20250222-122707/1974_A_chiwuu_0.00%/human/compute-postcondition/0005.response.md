The code snippet `t = b * 2` multiplies the value of `b` by 2 and assigns the result to `t`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except for the new variable `t` being introduced.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`); `t` is `b * 2`.**
