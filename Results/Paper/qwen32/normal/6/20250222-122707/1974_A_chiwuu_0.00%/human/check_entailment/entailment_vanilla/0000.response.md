Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.

### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons:** Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen is 5x3 (15 cells), we can fit a maximum of 3 2x2 icons per screen (3 * 4 = 12 cells used, 3 cells left).
2. **1x1 Icons:** After placing the 2x2 icons, we can fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons.

### Steps to Solve:
1. Calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space or if additional screens are required.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2  # This line is incorrect; it should be b (number of 2x2 icons) not b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `t`:** The variable `t` is incorrectly calculated as `b * 2`. It should simply be `b` because `t` represents the number of screens needed for `b` 2x2 icons.
2. **Calculation of `t1`:** The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct in principle, but `t` should be calculated properly first.
3. **Logic for Remaining 1x1 Icons:** The logic to determine the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is correct.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b  # Corrected: t should be b, not b * 2
        if t % 3 == 0:
            t = t // 3
        else:
            t = t // 3 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `t`. The corrected version of the program is provided above.
