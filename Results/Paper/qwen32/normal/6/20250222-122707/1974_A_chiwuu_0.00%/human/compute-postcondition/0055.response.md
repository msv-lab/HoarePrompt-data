To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case and how it evolves through each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization**: `n` is the number of test cases.
- **Loop Execution for Each Test Case**:
  - For each test case, two integers `a` and `b` are read.
  - `t` is calculated based on `b`:
    - If `b * 2` is divisible by 5, `t = (b * 2) // 5`.
    - Otherwise, `t = (b * 2) // 5 + 1`.
  - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
  - If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is adjusted to ensure `t1` becomes at least `a`:
    - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
    - `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` if `t2` is divisible by 15, or `t2 // 15 + 1` if not.
  - The final value of `t` is printed for each test case.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- The loop will execute `n` times, once for each test case.
- For each test case, the value of `t` is calculated and adjusted based on the input values `a` and `b`.
- The final output state will be the sequence of printed values of `t` for each of the `n` test cases.

### Output State:
Output State: **The output state is the sequence of `t` values printed for each of the `n` test cases.**

### Natural Language Description:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state consists of a sequence of `t` values, one for each test case. Each `t` value is determined by the input values `a` and `b` for that test case, following the calculations and adjustments described in the loop.
