Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`); If `t` (which is `b * 2`) is divisible by 5, then `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. `t1` is less than `a`. `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `n` remains greater than 0, `x` and `y` remain integers between 0 and 99, `a` and `b` remain as integers converted from their respective strings, `t` is updated based on the divisibility of `b * 2` by 5, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, and `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
