The code snippet provided modifies the variable `t` by performing integer division and addition. Initially, `t` is `2 * b`. After the operation `t = t // 5 + 1`, the value of `t` is recalculated based on the integer division of `t` by 5 and then adding 1 to the result.

Given the initial state, the variable `t` is updated to `(2 * b) // 5 + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0, `t` is `(2 * b) // 5 + 1`.**
