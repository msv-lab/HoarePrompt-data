Given the initial state and the operation `t = t // 5`, we need to determine the new value of `t` after the operation is performed. The other variables remain unchanged unless specified.

Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99
- `a` is the first input integer
- `b` is the second input integer
- `t` is `b * 2`
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`
- `i` is not defined in the initial state and has not been changed

The operation `t = t // 5` modifies the value of `t` by performing integer division by 5. Therefore, `t` will be updated to `floor(b * 2 / 5)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `t` is `b * 2 // 5`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is not defined.**

In natural language: The value of `t` is now the result of `b * 2` integer divided by 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
