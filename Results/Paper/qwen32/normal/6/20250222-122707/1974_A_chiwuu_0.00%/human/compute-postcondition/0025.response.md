The provided code snippet only includes the line `a = int(a)`. Since `a` is already described as the first input integer in the initial state, converting `a` to an integer does not change its value. Therefore, the state of `a` remains the same, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `t` is calculated as `b * 2 // 5` if `b * 2` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is not defined in the initial state and has not been changed**
