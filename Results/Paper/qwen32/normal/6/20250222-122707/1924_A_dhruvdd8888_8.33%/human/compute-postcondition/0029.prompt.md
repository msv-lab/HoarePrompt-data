Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if the length of `win` was less than `k` before the if statement, otherwise `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` is 0; `i` is an element of `us`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if `i` is in `us`, and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `ps` is incremented by 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` remains unchanged; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if `i` is in `us` and not already in `win`, and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `ps` is incremented by 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` remains unchanged; `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `us` and not already in `win`, `win` includes `i`. If the length of `win` becomes `k` after including `i`, `ans` includes `i` as its last element and `ps` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `us` or already in `win`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
