The function reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` from the input. It checks if it's possible to find at least `n` distinct sequences in `s` where each sequence contains all `k` unique lowercase English alphabets. If such sequences exist, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then for each missing alphabet in the last sequence, it prints a constructed string that includes the found sequences, the missing alphabet, and additional 'a's to meet the required sequence length of `n`.
