Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing all `k` elements; `ans` is a list containing the element `i`; `ps` is 1; `i` is an element of `us`. The condition len(win) == k is true, meaning `win` contains all the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Natural Language: The value of `ps` has been incremented by 1, so `ps` is now 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
