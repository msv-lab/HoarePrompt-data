The `print('NO')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`) and their properties, but these variables are not used in the print statement. Therefore, the output is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Output: **NO**
