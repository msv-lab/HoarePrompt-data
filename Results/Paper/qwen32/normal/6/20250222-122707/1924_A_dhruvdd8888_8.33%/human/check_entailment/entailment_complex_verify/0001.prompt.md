You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` from the input. It checks if it's possible to find at least `n` distinct sequences in `s` where each sequence contains all `k` unique lowercase English alphabets. If such sequences exist, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then for each missing alphabet in the last sequence, it prints a constructed string that includes the found sequences, the missing alphabet, and additional 'a's to meet the required sequence length of `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Key Points:
1. **Subsequence Check**: A string `a` is a subsequence of `b` if `a` can be derived from `b` by deleting some characters without reordering the remaining characters.
2. **Brute Force Approach**: The number of possible strings of length `n` using `k` characters is `k^n`, which can be very large (up to `26^26`), so a direct brute force check is computationally infeasible.
3. **Sliding Window Approach**: The provided code attempts to use a sliding window approach to check for subsequences, but it is flawed.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code uses a sliding window approach to check for subsequences, but it has several issues:
1. **Incorrect Sliding Window Logic**: The code attempts to clear the `win` set after finding `k` unique characters, which does not correctly simulate the subsequence check.
2. **Incorrect Condition for "YES"**: The code checks if `ps >= n`, but this does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
3. **Incorrect Construction of the Missing Subsequence**: The code attempts to construct a missing subsequence but does not correctly identify one.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
1. **Generating All Possible Strings**: Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters.
2. **Checking Each String**: For each string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Identifying Missing Subsequence**: If any string is not found, output "NO" and provide that string.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the sliding window logic and the incorrect conditions for "YES" and "NO", the provided code is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
