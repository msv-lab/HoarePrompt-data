The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it changes during each iteration.

Given that `i` is an element of `us` (a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets) and `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` will take on the value of the next character in the string `s` during each iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current character from the string `s`.
2. The loop iterates over each character in `s` in order.
3. To start the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Therefore, if the current character `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `s[j]`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `s[j+1]`, provided `j+1 < m`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `j` (the index of the current character `i` in `s`), we can express the state at the start of the next iteration in terms of the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if the length of `win` was less than `k` before the if statement, otherwise `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` is an empty list; `ps` is 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` is 0; `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.
