The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the set `us`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the current element in `us`, and if `i` was not in `win`, it was added to `win`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the set `us` after the current `i`.

Given that `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next element in `us` after the current `i`, we need to adjust `i` to be the next element in the iteration order of `us`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least one element; `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s`, and if the current character `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`; `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`; `ps` is a number of times `win` reached its size of `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`; `i` is the next element in the set `us` after the current `i`. If `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`.**

Since we are only adjusting `i` and it is the next element in the iteration order of `us`, we do not need to adjust any other variables.
