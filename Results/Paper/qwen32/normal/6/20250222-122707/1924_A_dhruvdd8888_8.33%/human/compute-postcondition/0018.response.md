The code snippet provided is `ps += 1`. This increments the value of `ps` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated value of `ps` will be its previous value plus 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `i`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing `i` and the previous elements of `ans`; `ps` is `ps + 1`; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**
