Postcondition: **`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `aa` is a list of integers read from the input with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
