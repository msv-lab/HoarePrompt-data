Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is `m + 1`, `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m + 1]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`. If `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` after the final iteration, and `fnd` is 2 if `tot >= k`, otherwise `fnd` is 1.**
