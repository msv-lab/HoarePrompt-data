The code snippet creates a `Counter` object named `cnt_bb` that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`. This affects the state by introducing a new variable, `cnt_bb`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `aa` is a list of integers read from the input; `bb` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`.**
