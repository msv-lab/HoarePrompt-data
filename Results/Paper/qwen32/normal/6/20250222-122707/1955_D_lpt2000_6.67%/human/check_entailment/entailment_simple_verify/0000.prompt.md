You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Analysis of the Program

The program is designed to count the number of subsegments of array `a` of length `m` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counters**:
   - `cnt_aa` keeps track of the counts of elements in the first subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - `cnt_bb` keeps track of the counts of elements in `b`.

3. **Intersection and Difference Counters**:
   - `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, which contains the common elements and their counts.
   - `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, representing elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `cnt_bb`.
   - `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, representing elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `cnt_aa`.

4. **Initial Check**:
   - `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, representing the number of matching elements in the initial subsegment.
   - `fnd` is incremented if `tot` is at least `k`.

5. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to update the counters as it slides through the array `a` from left to right.
   - For each new element `in_aa` added to the window and each element `out_aa` removed from the window:
     - It updates `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly.
     - It recalculates `tot` and increments `fnd` if `tot` is at least `k`.

6. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the value of `fnd`, which is the number of good subsegments.

### Correctness Verification

The program uses a sliding window technique combined with counters to efficiently determine the number of good subsegments. The logic appears to handle the following aspects correctly:
- It initializes the counters for the first subsegment.
- It updates the counters correctly as the window slides through the array.
- It checks if the current subsegment is good and increments the count accordingly.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly:
1. **All elements in `a` match `b`**: The program should count all subsegments as good.
2. **No elements in `a` match `b`**: The program should count zero good subsegments.
3. **Subsegments with repeated elements**: The program should correctly handle repeated elements in both `a` and `b`.
4. **Subsegments with elements not in `b`**: The program should correctly handle elements in `a` that do not appear in `b`.

Given the analysis and the edge cases considered, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification of the program, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
