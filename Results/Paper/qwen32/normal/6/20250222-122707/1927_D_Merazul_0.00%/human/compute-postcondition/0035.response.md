The code snippet assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`. Therefore, the values of `m` and `n` are updated to `k // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `k // 2`, `a` is the set of integers returned by `R()`, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `R` is a lambda function, `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`, `b` is the set of integers returned by `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`**
