You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing and Logic**:
    - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`).
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`), the array elements, the number of queries (`q`), and then the queries themselves.
    - However, the provided code does not correctly parse the input according to the problem statement. Specifically, it reads the array length and elements but then incorrectly reads the number of queries and the queries themselves as if they were part of the array elements.

2. **Processing the Queries**:
    - The provided code attempts to process queries but does not correctly handle the logic for finding two different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`. The code logic is not aligned with the problem requirements.
    - The code uses set operations and bitwise operations that do not correspond to the problem's requirements of checking for distinct elements within a subarray.

3. **Output**:
    - The code attempts to print 'Y' or 'N' based on some conditions, but the problem requires printing indices of two distinct elements or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The input parsing, logic, and output do not match the problem requirements.

### Correctness: **False**
