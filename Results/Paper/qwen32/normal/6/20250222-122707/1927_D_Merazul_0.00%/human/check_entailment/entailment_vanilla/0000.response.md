### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing and Logic**:
    - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`).
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`), the array elements, the number of queries (`q`), and then the queries themselves.
    - However, the provided code does not correctly parse the input according to the problem statement. Specifically, it reads the array length and elements but then incorrectly reads the number of queries and the queries themselves as if they were part of the array elements.

2. **Processing the Queries**:
    - The provided code attempts to process queries but does not correctly handle the logic for finding two different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`. The code logic is not aligned with the problem requirements.
    - The code uses set operations and bitwise operations that do not correspond to the problem's requirements of checking for distinct elements within a subarray.

3. **Output**:
    - The code attempts to print 'Y' or 'N' based on some conditions, but the problem requires printing indices of two distinct elements or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The input parsing, logic, and output do not match the problem requirements.

### Correctness: **False**
