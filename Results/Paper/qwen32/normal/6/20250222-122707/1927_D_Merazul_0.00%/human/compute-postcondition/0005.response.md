The code snippet `a = {*R()}` modifies the variable `a` by replacing it with a set of integers read from the input by the lambda function `R()`. The set will contain unique integers from the input line.

Given the initial state, `a` was a list of `n` integers. After the code execution, `a` becomes a set of integers read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `R`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a set of integers read from the input, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer; `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`.**
