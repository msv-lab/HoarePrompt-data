The code snippet appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. This new segment is created by extending the `max_segment` with the last index of the `arr`.

Given that `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index, and `arr` remains the same, the new segment will be `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.

Therefore, the `segments_variants` list will now include this new segment.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered and now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` remains -1.**
