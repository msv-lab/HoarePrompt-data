The code snippet assigns `new_segment` to a list containing the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the index `i` itself. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list `[arr[i], i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
