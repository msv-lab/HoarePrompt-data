Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list. If `new_segment` was non-empty before the if-else block, and `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is reset to `[]`, `segments_variants` contains either `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` if `new_segment[0]` is greater than or equal to `max_segment[0]`. In this case, `max_segment[0]` is also updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list. If `new_segment` was empty before the if-else block, `new_segment` is updated to a list containing the current element `arr[i]` and its index `i` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0; `max_segment` is `[arr[i], 0]`; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1. In all cases, `max_sum` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is either an empty list (if `arr[i] < 0` and the if condition is true), a list where the first element is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is true), or a list containing `[arr[i + 1], i + 1]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is false). `i` is `i + 1`. `max_segment[0]` is the original `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `i` is incremented by 1 if `arr[i] < 0` and `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1; `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i] < 0`, otherwise the first element of `new_segment` is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]`; `segments_variants` includes an additional list which is `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i] < 0` and `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise it contains the previous elements of `segments_variants` plus a new element which is `new_segment` concatenated with `[i - 1]`; `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0` and `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
