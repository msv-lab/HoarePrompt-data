You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        
    #State: `arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered; `max_sum` remains -1.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: `arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered and now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.
    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: `arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered and now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` remains -1; if `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`, it indicates that the maximum segment length is 1; otherwise, `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns `total_max_segment`, which is either `[-1]` indicating the maximum segment length is 1, or the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The function returns `total_max_segment`, which is either `[-1]` indicating that the maximum segment length is 1, or the segment (sublist) from `arr` that has the maximum sum among all possible segments.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `total_max_segment`, which is either `[-1]` indicating the maximum segment length is 1, or the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
