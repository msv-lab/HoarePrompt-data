Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list where the first element is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` modifies the first element of `new_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `max_segment[0]`) are updated as per their descriptions in the initial state.
