Postcondition: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered and now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` remains -1; if `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`, it indicates that the maximum segment length is 1; otherwise, `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.**
