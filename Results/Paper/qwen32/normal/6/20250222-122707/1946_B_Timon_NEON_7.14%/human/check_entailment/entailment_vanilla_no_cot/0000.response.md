Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully implement the solution to the problem. While it includes a function to perform modulo operation and a function to find the maximum segment sum, the third function `func_3` which is supposed to compute the final answer based on the number of operations and the maximum segment sum, is incomplete. 

The logic to maximize the sum of the array after k operations is not implemented. Specifically, the strategy would involve using the maximum segment sum found by `func_2` and adding it to the array `k` times. The implementation of this logic is missing in `func_3`.

Here is a brief outline of what `func_3` should do:

1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. Use the maximum segment sum found by `func_2` and add it to the total sum `k` times.
3. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since `func_3` is incomplete, the program is incorrect.
