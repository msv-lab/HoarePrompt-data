### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program consists of three functions, but `func_3` is not utilized in the main logic, so we will focus on `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of the given number.
   - It correctly implements the requirement to output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the contiguous subarray within the input array `arr` that has the maximum sum.
   - It uses a variation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - It handles the case where all elements are negative by returning `[-1]`, which is then treated as `0` in the main logic.
   - The function correctly identifies the maximum sum segment and its last index.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and the number of operations.
   - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum segment.
   - If the maximum sum segment is `[-1]`, it treats it as `0`.
   - It calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
     - This formula is derived from the idea that the maximum sum segment can be repeatedly added to the array to maximize the total sum.
     - The term `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k` accounts for the repeated addition of the maximum sum segment.
     - The term `sum(a) - max_segment[0]` accounts for the initial sum of the array minus the segment that is already counted in the repeated addition.
   - The final answer is then passed through `func_1` to ensure it is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations and handles the modulo requirement. The function `func_2` correctly identifies the maximum sum segment, and the main logic correctly applies the formula to compute the final result.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
