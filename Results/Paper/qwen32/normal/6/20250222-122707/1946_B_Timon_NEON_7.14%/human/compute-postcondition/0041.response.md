Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is either an empty list (if `arr[i] < 0` and the if condition is true), a list where the first element is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is true), or a list containing `[arr[i + 1], i + 1]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is false); `i` is `i + 1`; `segments_variants` contains the previous elements of `segments_variants` plus a new element which is `new_segment` concatenated with `[i - 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The list `segments_variants` now includes a new segment, which is the `new_segment` list concatenated with the value `[i - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous states, with `i` having been incremented by 1.
