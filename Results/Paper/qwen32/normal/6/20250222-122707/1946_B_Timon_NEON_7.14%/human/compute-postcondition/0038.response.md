Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is either an empty list (if `arr[i] < 0` and the if condition is true), a list where the first element is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is true), or a list containing `[arr[i + 1], i + 1]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is false). `i` is `i + 1`. `max_segment[0]` is the original `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`.**
