Output State: **`num` is the next element in `arr`; `x` is unchanged; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `count` is increased by the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`**

In natural language: The value of `count` is updated by adding the sum of the values retrieved from `mod_x_map` using `mod_x` as the key (defaulting to 0 if the key is not found) and `mod_y_map` using `mod_y` as the key (defaulting to 0 if the key is not found). All other variables (`num`, `x`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`) remain unchanged.
