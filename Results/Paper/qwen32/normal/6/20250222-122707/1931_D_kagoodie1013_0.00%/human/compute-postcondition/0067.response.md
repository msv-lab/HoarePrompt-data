Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The value of `mod_y` is now calculated as `num % y`. All other variables retain their previous values.
