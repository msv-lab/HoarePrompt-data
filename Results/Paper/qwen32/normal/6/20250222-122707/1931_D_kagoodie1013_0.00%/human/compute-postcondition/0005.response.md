The loop head in the provided code only mentions `num` and `arr`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to contain at least one element. The state of `num` is irrelevant before the loop starts because it gets assigned a value from `arr` during each iteration.

Given the context, it seems that `arr` should be a list derived from the `test_cases` list. However, based on the information provided, we can only adjust the state of `arr` directly.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is a list that must contain at least one element**.
