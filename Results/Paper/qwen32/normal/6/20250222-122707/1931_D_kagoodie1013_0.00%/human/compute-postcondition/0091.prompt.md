Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of valid pairs based on the modulo conditions; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_x_key` across all elements in `arr`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_y_key` across all elements in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is the final count after all iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `num % x` in `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `num % y` in `arr`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the last tuple in `test_cases`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` which is `(n-1)n` and the previous values of `count` if any; `count` is `(n-1)n`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as `mod_x_key` values from `arr` and values as their respective counts; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as `mod_y_key` values from `arr` and values as their respective counts; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
