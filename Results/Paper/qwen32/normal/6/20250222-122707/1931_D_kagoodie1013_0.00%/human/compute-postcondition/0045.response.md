The code snippet provided updates the value of `mod_y` by calculating the modulus of `num` with `y`. Therefore, `mod_y` will now hold the value `num % y`.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `mod_x`, `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_key`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the execution of this particular line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
