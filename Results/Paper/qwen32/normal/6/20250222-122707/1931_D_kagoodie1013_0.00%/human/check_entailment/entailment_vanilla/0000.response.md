Let's analyze the given Python program and determine whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to count the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array `a`.
- A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered "beautiful" if:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x`.
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one. For each test case, it counts the number of beautiful pairs using a combination of modulo operations and hash maps (dictionaries in Python).

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element in the array, the program calculates:
     - `mod_x = -num % x`
     - `mod_y = num % y`
   - It then checks how many previous elements have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y` values, as these would form beautiful pairs with the current element.
   - The program updates the count of elements with the current `mod_x` and `mod_y` in the respective dictionaries.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the program appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue lies in the calculation of `mod_x`. The program calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements. The correct calculation should be `mod_x = num % x` for both the current element and the elements being compared.

The condition for a pair to be beautiful is:
- \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x` → \((a_i \% x + a_j \% x) \% x = 0\)
- \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y` → \((a_i \% y - a_j \% y) \% y = 0\)

This means that for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful:
- `a_i % x` should be the negative of `a_j % x` modulo `x` (which is equivalent to `a_i % x == a_j % x`).
- `a_i % y` should be equal to `a_j % y`.

### Corrected Calculation:
Instead of `mod_x = -num % x`, the program should use `mod_x = num % x`.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`.

**Correctness: False**
