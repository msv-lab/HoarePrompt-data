The code snippet provided is:

```python
mod_y_map = {}
```

This line of code reassigns `mod_y_map` to be an empty dictionary, regardless of its previous state. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
