To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for num in arr:`. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust is `num`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples with specific constraints.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is incremented based on certain conditions.
- `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that are updated with certain keys and values.
- `arr` is a list with at least one element.
- `num` is the current element in `arr`.
- `mod_x` and `mod_y` are calculated based on `num`.
- `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` are also calculated based on `num`.
- `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in `arr`. Since `num` is the current element in the previous iteration, the next value of `num` should be the subsequent element in `arr`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `num` will be the next element in `arr`.

Other variables like `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, and `arr` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is incremented by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`; `arr` is a list that must contain at least one element; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`. The value of `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.**
