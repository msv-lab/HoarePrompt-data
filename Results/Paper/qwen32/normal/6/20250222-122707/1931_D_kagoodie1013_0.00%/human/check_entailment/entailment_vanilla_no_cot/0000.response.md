Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. The logic for counting the beautiful pairs is flawed. Specifically, the way the program calculates and uses the remainders to count pairs is incorrect.

The conditions for a pair (i, j) to be beautiful are:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

These conditions can be rephrased in terms of modular arithmetic:
1. \((a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x) \equiv 0 \mod x\)
2. \((a_i \mod y - a_j \mod y) \equiv 0 \mod y\)

The program incorrectly calculates the remainders and their contributions to the count. Specifically, the line `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect because it does not correctly represent the additive inverse in modular arithmetic. Instead, it should be `mod_x = num % x`.

Additionally, the way the program updates the count is incorrect. It should only consider pairs where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously, but the current implementation incorrectly adds counts based on individual conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_xy_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            key = (mod_x, mod_y)
            count += mod_xy_map.get(key, 0)
            mod_xy_map[key] = mod_xy_map.get(key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version uses a single dictionary to store pairs of remainders and counts the number of beautiful pairs correctly.
