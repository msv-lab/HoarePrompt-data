The code snippet assigns the value of `num % x` to `mod_x_key`. The value of `num % x` is calculated and stored in `mod_x_key`. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**
