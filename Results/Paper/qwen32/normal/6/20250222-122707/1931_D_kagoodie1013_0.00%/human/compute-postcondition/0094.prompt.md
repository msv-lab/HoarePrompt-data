You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the final values of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the final count after all iterations for the last tuple in `test_cases`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as `mod_x_key` values from `arr` and values as their respective counts for the last tuple in `test_cases`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as `mod_y_key` values from `arr` and values as their respective counts for the last tuple in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the last tuple in `test_cases`.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final values of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a. The function processes each tuple and returns a list `results`, where each element in `results` is the final value of `count` for the corresponding tuple in `test_cases`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final values of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
