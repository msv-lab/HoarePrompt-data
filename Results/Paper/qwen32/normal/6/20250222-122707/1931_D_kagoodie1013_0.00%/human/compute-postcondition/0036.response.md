The given code snippet calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`. However, in the initial state, `num` is not defined. Based on the provided context, `num` likely refers to an element of the list `arr` from the current tuple in `test_cases`. Since the exact value of `num` is not specified, we will represent `mod_x` in terms of `num`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; the first tuple in `test_cases` must have a list `a` with at least one integer; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

In natural language: The variable `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`, where `num` is an element from the list `arr` of the current tuple in `test_cases`. All other variables retain their initial values.
