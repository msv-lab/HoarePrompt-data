The code snippet provided calculates the value of `mod_y` by taking the modulus of `num` with `y`. The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `mod_x` is set to `-num % x`. The variable `mod_y` is newly calculated.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `mod_y` is now calculated as `num % y`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
