Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    mod_x = -num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
    mod_x_key = num % x
    mod_y_key = num % y
    mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
    mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`. `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is the next element in `arr`; `x` is unchanged; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `count` is increased by the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1; `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
