To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet in the context of the initial state. The code snippet is:

```python
mod_x = -num % x
```

Here, `num`, `x`, and `y` are values from the next tuple in `test_cases`. Since `num`, `x`, and `y` are not explicitly provided, we will use their general forms to derive the output state.

Given:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple.
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any.
- `count` is 0.
- `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element.

The code snippet calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`. This means `mod_x` will be the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `test_cases` remains a list of tuples with at least one more tuple. `results` remains a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any. `count` remains 0. `mod_x_map` remains an empty dictionary. `mod_y_map` remains an empty dictionary. `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element. `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
