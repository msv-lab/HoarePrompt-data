The code snippet `mod_y_key = num % y` assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `mod_y_key` depends on the values of `num` and `y`, which are part of the tuple `n, x, y, arr` from `test_cases`.

Since the initial state specifies that `test_cases` contains at least one tuple and `arr` has at least one element, we know that `num` is an element from `arr`. However, without specific values for `num` and `y`, we can only express `mod_y_key` as `num % y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**
