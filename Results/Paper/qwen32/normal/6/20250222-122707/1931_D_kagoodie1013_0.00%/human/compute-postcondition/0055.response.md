The code snippet modifies the value of `mod_x_key` by setting it to `num % x`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the new value of `mod_x_key` in subsequent operations, which are not shown here.

Output State: **`num` is the next element in `arr`; `x` is unchanged; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `count` is increased by the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**
