Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Analysis of the Program

The program is supposed to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its digits.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Splitting Elements**: The program should correctly split elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.
2. **Checking Sorted Order**: After potential splits, the program should correctly determine if the array is sorted in non-descending order.
3. **Iterating Through the Array**: The program should iterate through the array and handle all possible splits and checks.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Splitting Logic**: The provided code only attempts to split an element if it is greater than the next element and greater than 10. This is incorrect because we need to check and potentially split every element that is at least 10, not just when it is greater than the next element.
2. **Handling Multiple Splits**: The code only performs one split per iteration and does not handle the case where multiple splits are needed to sort the array.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if the list is sorted, but the main logic for splitting and checking needs to be improved.

### Correctness Analysis
Given these issues, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
12 2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- The element `12` can be split into `1` and `2`.
- After splitting, the array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 5]`, which is sorted.

However, the provided program will not split `12` because `12` is not greater than `2`. Therefore, it will incorrectly output `NO`.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and can fail for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

#### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program only attempts to split an element if it is greater than the next element and greater than 10, which is incorrect. It does not handle the case where multiple splits are needed or where an element should be split regardless of the next element. This can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.
