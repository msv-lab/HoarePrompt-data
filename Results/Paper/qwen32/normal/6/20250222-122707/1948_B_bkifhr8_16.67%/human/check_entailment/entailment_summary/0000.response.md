Reasoning:  
The provided execution summary indicates that the function `func_1` is supposed to check if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the summary incorrectly states that `func_1` returns `True` regardless of the input values. This is not consistent with the actual implementation of `func_1` in the given code, which correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.

The main logic of the program involves iterating through the list and attempting to split any element greater than or equal to 10 into its constituent digits. This is done to see if the list can be made sorted by performing the allowed operations.

However, there is a logical flaw in the main loop of the program. The current implementation only checks if the current element is less than the previous one and if the previous one is greater than 10. If this condition is met, it splits the previous element. This approach does not guarantee that the list will be sorted after all possible splits are performed. It only checks for the first instance where a split could potentially be needed.

Moreover, the main loop only performs one pass through the list, which may not be enough if multiple splits are required to achieve a sorted list. The program should continue to iterate through the list until no more splits are needed or until it can be determined that the list cannot be sorted.

Given these points, the program as written does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the list can be sorted using the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
