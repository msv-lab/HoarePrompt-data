Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is 1000000007; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input; `i` is `m - 1`; `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `n`, `m` remain unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- `k` and `M` remain unchanged at 1000000007.
- `c` remains as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- `s` remains 0.
- `a` is the total sum of all `f` values that were read from the input during each iteration of the loop.
- `i` is equal to `m - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `m` iterations.
- `u`, `v`, and `f` hold the values from the last iteration's input.
