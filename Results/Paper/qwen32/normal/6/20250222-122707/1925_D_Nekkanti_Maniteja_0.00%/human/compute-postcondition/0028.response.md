The code snippet `s = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `s`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input; `n` and `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third integer read from the input; `M` is 10; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo 10; `s` is 0.**
