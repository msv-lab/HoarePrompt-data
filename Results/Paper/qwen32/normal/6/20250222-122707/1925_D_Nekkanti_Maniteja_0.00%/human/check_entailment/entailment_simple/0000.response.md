### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions.
   - If a pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It calculates the modular inverse \(c\) of \(n(n-1)/2\) modulo \(10^9+7\).
   - It initializes `a` to sum up all initial friendship values.
   - It initializes `s` to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values.
   - It then iterates over `k` excursions and updates `s` in each iteration.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse \(c\) of the total number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This seems correct as it is used to normalize the probability of selecting any given pair of friends.
   - The program sums up the initial friendship values in `a`. This is correct.
   - However, the way `s` is being updated in the loop over `k` iterations seems incorrect. The loop should calculate the expected value considering the increase in friendship values over the iterations. The current logic does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{m \cdot i + a}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \right)
     \]
   - This needs to be computed modulo \(10^9+7\).

5. **Fixing the Program:**
   - The program should correctly compute the expected value using the above formula.
   - The current implementation does not correctly update `s` to reflect the increasing friendship values.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
