The code snippet assigns the value `10 ** 9 + 7` to a new variable `M`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `M` with its assigned value, while `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where `n` is the first integer, `m` is the second integer, and `k` is the third integer from the input line; `M` is 1000000007.**
