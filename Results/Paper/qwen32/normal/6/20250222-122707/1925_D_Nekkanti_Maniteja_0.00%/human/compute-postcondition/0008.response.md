Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is 1000000007; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f`; `i` is 0; `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been updated to the value of `f`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
