Precondition: **Each test case consists of integers n, m, and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. For each of the m pairs of friends, the input specifies two distinct children a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) and their initial friendship value f_i (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
