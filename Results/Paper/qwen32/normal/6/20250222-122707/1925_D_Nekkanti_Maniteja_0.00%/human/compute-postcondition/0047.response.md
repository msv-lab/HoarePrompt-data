To determine the output of the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to understand the value of `s` after it has been updated according to the given formula, and the values of `M`.

The initial state provides the following:
- `s` is updated to `s + c * a * k + c * c * m * (k-1) * k / 2`.
- `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, `a` remain the same (their specific values are not provided).

Given the formula for the new value of `s`, we can describe the printed output as follows:

The new value of `s` is calculated as:
\[ s = s + (c \times a \times k) + (c \times c \times m \times \frac{(k-1) \times k}{2}) \]

The expression `s % M` computes the remainder when the new value of `s` is divided by `M`.

Since the exact values of `s`, `c`, `a`, `m`, `k`, and `M` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s % M`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **s % M (where s is updated to s + c * a * k + c * c * m * (k-1) * k / 2, and M is the given modulus)**
