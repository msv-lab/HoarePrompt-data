The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The initial state specifies that `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input, but their specific values are not given. After executing this code, the values of `u`, `v`, and `f` will be updated to the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is 1000000007; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f + f`; `i` is 2; `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` and `m` are still greater than 0; `k` and `M` remain 1000000007; `c` is still the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is still 0; `a` is still `f + f`; `i` is still 2; and `u`, `v`, and `f` are now the integers read from the input.
