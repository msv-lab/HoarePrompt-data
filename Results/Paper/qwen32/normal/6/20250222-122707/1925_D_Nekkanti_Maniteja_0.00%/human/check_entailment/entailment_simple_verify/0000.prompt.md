You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the number of possible pairs of children. However, this is not used correctly in the subsequent calculations.
   - The probability `c` should be used to weight the contribution of each friend pair to the expected value, but the current implementation incorrectly multiplies `c` multiple times and adds `a` (the sum of initial friendship values) in a loop that iterates `k` times. This does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

2. **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of each friend pair being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The current implementation does not correctly account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen, and this increase should be weighted by the probability of the pair being chosen.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where there are no friend pairs (`m = 0`). It should return 0 for such cases, but the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic.

4. **Incorrect Use of Modular Inverse**:
   - The modular inverse is used incorrectly in the loop that calculates `s`. The current implementation does not correctly accumulate the expected value using the modular inverse.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should correctly calculate the expected value:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, MOD)  # Probability of choosing any specific pair
        
        # Calculate the initial expected value
        initial_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            initial_sum += f
        
        # Calculate the expected increase in friendship values
        expected_increase = 0
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            expected_increase = (expected_increase + i * prob * m) % MOD
        
        # Calculate the final expected value
        final_expected_value = (initial_sum + expected_increase) % MOD
        print(final_expected_value)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the expected value by considering the probability of each friend pair being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.
