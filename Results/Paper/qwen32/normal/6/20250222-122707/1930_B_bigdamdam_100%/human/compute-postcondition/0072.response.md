The code snippet increments the variable `ind` by 2. Given the initial state, `ind` is initially set to `3 + n % 2`. After the operation `ind += 2`, the new value of `ind` will be `3 + n % 2 + 2`, which simplifies to `5 + n % 2`.

The values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`p` is a list where elements at even indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2*((n-1)//2) are `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n-2*((n-1)//2)` respectively, the element at index 1 is `1 + n % 2`, the element at index 3 is `3 + n % 2`, and the rest are zeros; `ind` is `5 + n % 2`; `i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 3**.
