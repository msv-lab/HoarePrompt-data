The code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so this assignment changes the first element of the list `p` from 0 to `ind`.

Given that `ind` is equal to `n - 4`, the first element of `p` is now `n - 4`.

The other elements of `p` remain zeros, and the values of `n`, `ind`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n - 4`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`, `i` is 0**.
