The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it generates a list `p` of length `n` where the even indices are filled with descending even numbers starting from `n` and the odd indices are filled with ascending odd numbers starting from `1 + n % 2`. The function prints this list for each test case.
