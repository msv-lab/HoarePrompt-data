The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `ind` is `3 + n % 2`. Therefore, after the increment, `ind` becomes `5 + n % 2`. The values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is a list where the first `floor(n/2)` even indices are filled with values `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-2), ind, 0, ..., 0` with the element at index `1` replaced by `ind`, `ind` is `5 + n % 2`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than 1**.
