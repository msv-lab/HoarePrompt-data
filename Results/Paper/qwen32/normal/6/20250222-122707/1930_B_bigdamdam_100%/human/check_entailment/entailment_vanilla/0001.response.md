Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that there are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `1 <= i, j < n`, `i != j`) where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.

### Program Analysis:
The program constructs a permutation `p` for each test case as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - It initializes an array `p` of length `n` with all zeros.
   - It fills the even indices of `p` (0-based) with decreasing values starting from `n` down to `n - 2`, `n - 4`, and so on. This is achieved by starting with `ind = n` and decrementing `ind` by 2 in each step.
   - It fills the odd indices of `p` with increasing values starting from `1 + n % 2` up to `n - 1`, `n - 3`, and so on. This is achieved by starting with `ind = 1 + n % 2` and incrementing `ind` by 2 in each step.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the problem's condition:

1. **Even Indices:**
   - Values are in descending order.
   - The largest value is `n`, and the smallest value is `2` if `n` is even or `1` if `n` is odd.

2. **Odd Indices:**
   - Values are in ascending order.
   - The smallest value is `1` if `n` is odd or `2` if `n` is even, and the largest value is `n-1` if `n` is even or `n` if `n` is odd.

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - For any `i` and `j` (with `1 <= i, j < n`, `i != j`), the condition `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]` cannot hold because:
     - The values at even indices are in descending order, and the values at odd indices are in ascending order.
     - The largest value in the even indices is `n`, and the smallest value in the odd indices is `1` (or `2` if `n` is even).
     - Therefore, no value in the even indices can divide any value in the odd indices, and vice versa.

### Conclusion:
The constructed permutation `p` satisfies the problem's condition. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
