The code snippet `p[i] = ind` attempts to assign the value of `ind` to the `i`-th element of the list `p`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which would result in a `NameError` during execution. Assuming `i` is supposed to be a valid index for the list `p` (e.g., `i` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code), we will proceed with the assumption that `i` is a valid index between 0 and `n-1`.

Given that `ind` is equal to `n` and `p` is a list of `n` zeros, after executing the code `p[i] = ind`, the `i`-th element of `p` will be updated to the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n`**. Here, `p[i]` is specifically set to `n`, while the rest of the elements in `p` remain zeros.
