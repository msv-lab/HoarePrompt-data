To determine the output of the `print(*p)` statement, we need to break down the initial state and understand how the list `p` is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **List `p` Construction:**
   - The list `p` is filled based on the value of `n`.
   - For even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., `floor(n/2) - 1`), the values are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1)`.
   - For odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., `floor(n/2)`), the values are `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., n-1 + n % 2`.

2. **Variable `ind`:**
   - `ind` is calculated as `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (floor(n/2) - 1)`.
   - This variable is not directly used in the `print(*p)` statement, so we can ignore it for now.

3. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd.
   - This variable is also not directly used in the `print(*p)` statement, so we can ignore it for now.

### Constructing the List `p`:

Let's walk through the construction of `p` with an example value of `n`.

#### Example with `n = 6` (even):

- **Even Indices (0, 2, 4):**
  - `p[0] = 6`
  - `p[2] = 4`
  - `p[4] = 2`

- **Odd Indices (1, 3, 5):**
  - `p[1] = 1 + 6 % 2 = 1`
  - `p[3] = 3 + 6 % 2 = 3`
  - `p[5] = 5 + 6 % 2 = 5`

So, `p` would be `[6, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.

#### Example with `n = 5` (odd):

- **Even Indices (0, 2, 4):**
  - `p[0] = 5`
  - `p[2] = 3`
  - `p[4] = 1`

- **Odd Indices (1, 3):**
  - `p[1] = 1 + 5 % 2 = 2`
  - `p[3] = 3 + 5 % 2 = 4`

So, `p` would be `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

### Generalizing the Output:

Based on the above examples, we can generalize the construction of `p`:

- For even `n`:
  - `p` will have `n/2` even indices and `n/2` odd indices.
  - Even indices will be filled with `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2`.
  - Odd indices will be filled with `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1`.

- For odd `n`:
  - `p` will have `(n+1)/2` even indices and `(n-1)/2` odd indices.
  - Even indices will be filled with `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 1`.
  - Odd indices will be filled with `2, 4, 6, ..., n-1`.

### Final Output:

Given the general construction of `p`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[n, 1 + n % 2, n-2, 3 + n % 2, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1), (n-1) + n % 2] (where n is the given integer)**

This description accurately represents the construction of the list `p` based on the initial state provided.
