The value of `ind` is reassigned to the value of `n`. The other variables (`p`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a list of `n` zeros; `ind` is the value of `n`; `i` is `2`; `n` is the first integer from the input.

Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros; `ind` is the value of `n`; `i` is `2`; `n` is the first integer from the input.**
