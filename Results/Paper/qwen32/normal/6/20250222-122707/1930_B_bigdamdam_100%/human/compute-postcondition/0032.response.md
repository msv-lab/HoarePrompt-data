Output State: **`p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros, `ind` is the value of `n` minus 2, `i` is `0`, `n` must be greater than `0`.**

Natural language: The value of `ind` has been decreased by 2, so it is now `n - 2`. The values of `p` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `0` is still valid.
