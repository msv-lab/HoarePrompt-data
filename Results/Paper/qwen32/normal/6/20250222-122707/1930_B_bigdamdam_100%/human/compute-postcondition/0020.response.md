The code snippet increments the variable `ind` by 2. The other variables and the list `p` remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `ind` is `3 + n % 2`. After the increment, `ind` becomes `(3 + n % 2) + 2`, which simplifies to `5 + n % 2`.

Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2]` is `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`, `p[5 + n % 2]` is `3 + n % 2`, and `p[j]` is `1 + n % 2` for all other `j` not specified; `ind` is `5 + n % 2`; `i` is `5 + n % 2`; `n` must be greater than 1.**
