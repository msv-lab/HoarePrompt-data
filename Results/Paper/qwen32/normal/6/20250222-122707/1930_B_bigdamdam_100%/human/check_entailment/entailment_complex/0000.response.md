### Reasoning:
The program aims to generate a permutation of length `n` such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. The program constructs the permutation by filling even indices with descending even numbers starting from `n` and odd indices with ascending odd numbers starting from `1 + n % 2`.

Let's analyze the construction:

1. **Even Indices**:
   - Filled with descending even numbers starting from `n`.
   - For example, for `n = 4`, the even indices would be filled with `[4, 2]`.
   - For `n = 5`, the even indices would be filled with `[5, 3, 1]`.

2. **Odd Indices**:
   - Filled with ascending odd numbers starting from `1 + n % 2`.
   - For example, for `n = 4`, the odd indices would be filled with `[1]`.
   - For `n = 5`, the odd indices would be filled with `[2, 4]`.

### Verification:
- **No Divisibility Condition Violation**:
  - The even-indexed elements are in descending order, and the odd-indexed elements are in ascending order.
  - The largest number in the even-indexed positions is `n`, and the smallest number in the odd-indexed positions is either `1` or `2`.
  - Since the even-indexed elements are all greater than the odd-indexed elements, there is no way for `p_i` to divide `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` to divide `p_{j+1}` because the even-indexed elements are too large to be divisible by the odd-indexed elements and vice versa.

### Conclusion:
The provided program constructs a valid permutation for each test case that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
