The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is `n - 4`. After the operation, `ind` becomes `n - 6`. The values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the element at index `2` is `n - 2`, the element at index `4` is `n - 4`, and the rest are zeros; `ind` is `n - 6`; `i` is `4`; `n` must be greater than `4`.**
