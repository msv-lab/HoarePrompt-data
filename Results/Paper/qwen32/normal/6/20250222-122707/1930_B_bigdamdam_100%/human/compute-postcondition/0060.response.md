The code snippet assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Given the initial state, `p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros, `ind` is `n - 2`, and `i` is 2. After the assignment, the element at index 2 in the list `p` will be `n - 2`.

Output State: **`p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the second element is 0, the third element is `n - 2`, and the rest are zeros; `ind` is `n - 2`; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0.**
