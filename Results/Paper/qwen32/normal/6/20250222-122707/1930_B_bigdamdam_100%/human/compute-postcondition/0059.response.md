The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, and it starts from 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `ind` is `n - 2`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 and should still be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same, and it must still be greater than 0.

State: **`p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros, `ind` is `n - 2`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
