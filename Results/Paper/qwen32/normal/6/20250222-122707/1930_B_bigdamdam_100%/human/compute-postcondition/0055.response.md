The code snippet `ind = n` changes the value of the variable `ind` to the value of `n`. The other variables (`p`, `i`) remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is calculated as `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (floor(n/2) - 1)`, and `i` is `0`. After the code execution, `ind` is simply `n`.

Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros; `ind` is `n`; `i` is `0`; `n` is the first integer from the input list.**
