Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `c` is 0.**

This means that the variable `c` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
