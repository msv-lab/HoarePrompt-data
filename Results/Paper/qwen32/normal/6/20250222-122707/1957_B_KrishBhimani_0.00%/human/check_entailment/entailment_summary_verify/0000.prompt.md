You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs and prints a list `ans` of length `n` where the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The list is constructed by adding powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k` and adjusting the last element to ensure the sum matches `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The program constructs the sequence by first identifying the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k` and then creating a sequence where each position with a 1 is represented by a power of 2. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 7
```
The binary representation of 7 is `111`. The program will construct the sequence as `[1, 2, 4]` because `1 | 2 | 4 = 7` and the binary representation of 7 has three 1s. However, there is a better sequence that also sums to 7 but has more 1s in its bitwise OR representation.

A better sequence could be `[3, 3, 1]` because `3 | 3 | 1 = 3` and the binary representation of 3 is `11`, which has two 1s, and the binary representation of 1 is `1`, which has one 1. However, the bitwise OR of `[3, 3, 1]` is `3` which is `11` in binary and has only two 1s. But we can do better.

A correct sequence for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR representation could be `[1, 1, 5]` because `1 | 1 | 5 = 7` and the binary representation of 7 is `111`, which has three 1s.

The program does not handle cases where a different distribution of numbers could result in a higher number of 1s in the bitwise OR representation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Counterexample:
```
1
3 7
```
Expected output: A sequence like `[1, 1, 5]` or `[1, 3, 3]` or `[3, 1, 3]` or `[5, 1, 1]` which has a bitwise OR with the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
Actual output: `[1, 2, 4]` which has a bitwise OR of `7` but does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR for all possible sequences.
