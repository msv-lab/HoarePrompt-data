The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given that `i` is 0, `arr` will now contain the single element 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1` and `k` is odd; `arr` is [0]; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0**
