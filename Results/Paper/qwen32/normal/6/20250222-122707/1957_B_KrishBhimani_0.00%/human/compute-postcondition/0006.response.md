To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is non-zero.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `i` is 0.

The loop condition is `while k:`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be a non-zero integer. 

Since `k` is derived from the second element of `l1`, the only way to ensure the loop executes is to make sure that `k` is not zero. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `k` is a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0**.
