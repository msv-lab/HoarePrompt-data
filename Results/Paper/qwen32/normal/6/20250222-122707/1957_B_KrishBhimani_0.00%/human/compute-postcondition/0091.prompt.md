Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`; `c` is 0; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element; `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `c` is increased by 1; `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element; `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `c` is increased by 1; `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, the loop or if statement is broken out of and `ans` includes the elements `1 << i` and `k0 - (1 << i)`. `c` is now `c + 1`. `ans` now includes the additional element `1 << i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element, `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i` and potentially `k0 - (1 << i)` if `c` was equal to `n - 1` in the previous iteration. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` now includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `ans`. `c` is now `c + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
