Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` right-shifted by 1; `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `i` is 2; `arr` is a list containing the elements 0, 1, and 2 if `k & 1` equals 1, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the element 1; `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted; `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` reached `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been right-shifted by 1, meaning it is now equal to `k // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
