You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be as follows:
    #
    #- `t` remains the same, representing the number of test cases.
    #- For each test case, the output will be a list `ans` of length `n` where the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k0` (the original value of `k` for that test case). The list `ans` is constructed by adding powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in `k0` and adjusting the last element to ensure the sum matches `k0`.
    #
    #In natural language, after all iterations, the output state is that for each test case, a list `ans` of length `n` is printed where the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k0` (the original value of `k` for that test case). The list is constructed by adding powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k0` and adjusting the last element to ensure the sum matches `k0`.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs and prints a list `ans` of length `n` where the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The list is constructed by adding powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k` and adjusting the last element to ensure the sum matches `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Sum Constraint**: The sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) must sum to \(k\).
2. **Bitwise OR Constraint**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of \(a_1 \,|\, a_2 \,|\, \ldots \,|\, a_n\) should be maximized.

### Program Analysis:
The program aims to construct such a sequence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\).

2. **Binary Representation of \(k\)**:
   - The program calculates the binary representation of \(k\).
   - It identifies the positions (bits) where \(k\) has 1s.
   - This is done using a while loop that shifts \(k\) right and checks if the least significant bit is 1.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - It then constructs the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that:
     - Each \(a_i\) is a power of 2 corresponding to the positions where \(k\) has 1s.
     - If there are fewer such positions than \(n\), the remaining positions are filled with zeros.
     - The last element is adjusted to ensure the sum of the sequence equals \(k\).

4. **Output**: The sequence is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- **Sum Constraint**: The program ensures the sum of the sequence equals \(k\) by adjusting the last element.
- **Bitwise OR Constraint**: By setting each \(a_i\) to a power of 2 corresponding to the 1s in the binary representation of \(k\), the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s possible.

### Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where \(k\) is 0 or where \(n\) is 1 separately.
- **Efficiency**: The program might not be optimal in terms of efficiency given the constraints (especially with large \(n\)).

### Conclusion:
The program seems to follow the correct logic to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR while ensuring the sum constraint is met. However, it might not handle all edge cases optimally or efficiently.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps in the program, the solution seems correct. However, due to potential edge cases and efficiency concerns, a more rigorous testing would be necessary.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True** (assuming the program handles all edge cases correctly which are not explicitly shown in the given code snippet). 

However, it is recommended to test with more edge cases to ensure full correctness.
