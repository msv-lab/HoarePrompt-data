To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations.

### Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
   - `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
   - `k` is 0
   - `k0` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `arr` is an empty list
   - `ans` is an empty list
   - `c` is 0

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over `arr`.
   - For each element `i` in `arr`, it checks if `c == n - 1`.
     - If `c == n - 1`, it appends `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it appends `1 << i` to `ans` and increments `c` by 1.

3. **Output States:**
   - **After 1 iteration:**
     - `ans` is `[1]` if `c != n - 1`, or `[0, 1]` if `c == n - 1`.
     - `c` is incremented by 1 if `c != n - 1`.
   - **After 2 iterations:**
     - `ans` is `[1, 1 << i]` if `c != n - 1`, or `[0, 1, k0 - 1]` if `c == n - 1`.
     - `c` is incremented by 1 if `c != n - 1`.
   - **After 3 iterations:**
     - `ans` is `[1, 1 << i, 1 << i]` if `c != n - 1`, or `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` if `c == n - 1`.
     - `c` is incremented by 1 if `c != n - 1`.

### Final Output State

The loop will continue until `c` reaches `n - 1`. At this point, the loop appends `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` and breaks.

- `ans` will have `n` elements.
- The first `n-1` elements will be `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`.
- The last element will be `k0 - sum(ans[:n-1])`.

Since `k` and `k0` are both 0, the last element will be `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.

### Conclusion

The final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the last element in `arr`; `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will generate a list `ans` with `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the elements in `arr`, and the last element is the negative sum of the first `n-1` elements.
