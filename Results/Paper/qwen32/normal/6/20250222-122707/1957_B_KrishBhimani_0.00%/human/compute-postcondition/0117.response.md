The code snippet provided simply reinitializes the `ans` list to be an empty list. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k_initial`; `arr` is a list of indices where the corresponding bit in `k_initial` is 1; `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted; `ans` is an empty list.**
