The provided code snippet appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length is equal to `n`. Given that `ans` initially has `n` elements (due to its construction in the initial state), this operation does not change the length of `ans`. Therefore, the list `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the last element in `arr`; `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**
