The code snippet takes a list of substrings `l1` and maps them to integers, then unpacks these integers into the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range and `l1` is a list of substrings.

Since `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string, and the code maps these substrings to integers, we can infer that `l1` must contain exactly two elements that can be converted to integers. After the execution of the code, `n` will hold the integer value of the first element of `l1`, and `k` will hold the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.**
