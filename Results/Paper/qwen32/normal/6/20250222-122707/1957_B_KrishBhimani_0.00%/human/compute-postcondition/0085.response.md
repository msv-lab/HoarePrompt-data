The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the variable that iterates over `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is 0.
- `k0` is the original `k`.
- `i` is the next element in `arr`.
- `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element.
- `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `c` is increased by 1.
- `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, the loop or if statement is broken out of and `ans` includes the elements `1 << i` and `k0 - (1 << i)`.
- `c` is now `c + 1`.
- `ans` now includes the additional element `1 << i`.

Since `i` is the current element being processed in `arr` and the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, we need to advance `i` to the next element in `arr` for the next iteration to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element, `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i` and potentially `k0 - (1 << i)` if `c` was equal to `n - 1` in the previous iteration**.
