The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1` left-shifted by `i` bits to the list `ans`. This operation effectively appends `2^i` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` can either be `[0]` or `[]` depending on the condition `c == n - 1`. However, the code snippet modifies `ans` by appending a new value, thus changing its state.

Since `i` is initially `0`, `1 << i` will be `1 << 0` which is `1`. Therefore, `1` will be appended to `ans`.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is a list with at least one element; `ans` is [0, 1] if `c == n - 1`, otherwise `ans` is [1]; `c` is an integer such that `c == n - 1` if we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `c` retains its original value + 1.**
