The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` updates the values of `n` and `k` by mapping the first two elements of the list `l1` to integers and assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`
- `k` is 0
- `k0` is 0
- `i` is the last element in `arr`
- `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements
- `c` is `n - 1`
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is updated to the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is updated to the integer value of the second element of `l1`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is 0; `i` is the last element in `arr`; `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**
