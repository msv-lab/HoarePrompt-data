Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    arr = []
    k0 = k
    i = 0
    while k:
        if k & 1 == 1:
            arr.append(i)
        k = k >> 1
        i += 1
    ans = []
    c = 0
    for i in arr:
        if c == n - 1:
            ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
            break
        c += 1
        ans.append(1 << i)
    ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the last element in `arr`; `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`; `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted; `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` reached `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is a list containing `1 << i` for each element in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, then `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended if `c` reaches `n - 1`, and `ans` is padded with zeros to a length of `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
