Output State: **`arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is incremented by 2; `ans` has elements including `1 << i1` and `k0 - sum(ans)` before the last element was added; `i` is `i2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `arr`, `c`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
