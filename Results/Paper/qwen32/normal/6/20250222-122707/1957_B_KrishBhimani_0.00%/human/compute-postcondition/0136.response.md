The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial state, `c` was incremented by 2 before this code snippet, so now it is incremented by an additional 1. Therefore, the new value of `c` is `c + 1`.

The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, `i`, `i1`, `i2`, `n`, `k0`) remain unchanged by this code snippet. Specifically:
- `arr` must still have at least two elements.
- `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i1`, and it will include an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` equals `n - 1` before the loop breaks.
- `i` is still `i2`.
- The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement are still based on whether `c` equals `n - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is incremented by 3; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i1`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)` before the last element was added, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` has `1 << i1` as its last element, and the loop or if statement continues. `i` is `i2`.**
