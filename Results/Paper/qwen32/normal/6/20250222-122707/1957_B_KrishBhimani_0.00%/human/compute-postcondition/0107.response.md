The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the value 1 is appended to `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer; `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `i` is 1; `arr` is a list containing the elements 0 and 1 if `k & 1` equals 1, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the element 1; `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted; `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` reached `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`. Additionally, if `k & 1` equals 1, `arr` contains the elements 0 and 1.**
