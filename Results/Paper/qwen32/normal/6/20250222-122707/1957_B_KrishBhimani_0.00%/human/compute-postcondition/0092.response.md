The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length is equal to `n`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is a list that already contains certain elements. The number of elements in `ans` is determined by the conditions involving `c`, `n`, and `arr`. After executing the code, `ans` will be extended with zeros to ensure its length is `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`; `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted; `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` reached `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**
