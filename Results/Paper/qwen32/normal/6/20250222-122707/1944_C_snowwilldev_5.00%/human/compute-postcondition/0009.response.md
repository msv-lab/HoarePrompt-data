The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the `cnt` dictionary by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is `t + 2`, so `cnt[a[t + 2]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `N` is an input integer and must be greater than `t + 1`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1, specifically `cnt[a[t + 1]]` is incremented by 1, and `cnt[a[t + 2]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is `t + 2`.**
