To determine the output of the `print(i)` statement, let's break down the given initial state step by step:

1. **`tc` is `x + 1`**: This tells us that `tc` is defined as one more than the value of `x`. However, `tc` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

2. **`N` is greater than 0**: This indicates that `N` is a positive integer, but it is also not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

3. **`a` is the list of integers from the input**: This means that `a` is a list of integers, but the specific integers are not provided.

4. **`cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`**: This tells us that `cnt` is a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`.

5. **If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged**: This describes how the variable `t` is incremented based on the counts in `cnt`, but `t` is also not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.

6. **`i` is `x + 2`**: This tells us that `i` is defined as two more than the value of `x`.

Given the above information, the only variable we need to focus on is `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is defined as `x + 2`.

Since the value of `x` is not explicitly provided, we can only express `i` in terms of `x`. Therefore, the output of `print(i)` will be `x + 2`.

Output: **x + 2 (where x is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided)**
