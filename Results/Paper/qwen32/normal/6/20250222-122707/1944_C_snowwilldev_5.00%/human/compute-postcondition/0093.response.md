The given code snippet increments the variable `t` by 1. None of the other variables (`tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is an integer greater than `x + 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is increased by 1.**
