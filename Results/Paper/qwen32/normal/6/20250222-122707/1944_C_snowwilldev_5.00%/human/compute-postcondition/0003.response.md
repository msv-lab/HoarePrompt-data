The code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` object named `cnt` with a default integer value of 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `N`, and `a`, while a new variable `cnt` is introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `N` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0.**
