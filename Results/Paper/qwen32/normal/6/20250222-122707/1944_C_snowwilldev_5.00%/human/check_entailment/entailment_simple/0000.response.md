### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players and computes the MEX of the final array `c` as described in the problem.

1. **Understanding the MEX**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. For example, the MEX of `[2, 2, 1]` is `0`, and the MEX of `[0, 1, 2, 3]` is `4`.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or simply removing them (Bob).
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to include as many unique elements as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should aim to prevent Alice from including unique elements in `c` to minimize the MEX.

4. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N-1` and checks the counts:
     - If an element appears exactly once, it increments a counter `t`.
     - If `t` reaches `2` or an element count is `0`, it prints the current number `i` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
   - The key insight is that Alice should aim to include as many unique elements as possible, but Bob will block her if he can.
   - The MEX will be the smallest number that is not included in `c` after both players have played optimally.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`[0, 0, 1, 1]`):
     - Alice can pick `1`, then `0`, then `1`, then `0`. The final `c` is `[1, 0, 1, 0]`, and the MEX is `2`.
     - The program's logic might not correctly simulate this optimal play.
   - For the second test case (`[0, 1, 2, 3]`):
     - Alice can pick `0`, then `1`, then `2`, then `3`. The final `c` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, and the MEX is `4`.
     - However, Bob can block Alice from picking `0` or `1` first, and the final `c` might be `[2, 3, 0, 1]` with MEX `4`, but the program might not correctly simulate this.
   - For the third test case (`[1, 1]`):
     - Alice can pick `1`, then Bob picks `1`. The final `c` is `[1]`, and the MEX is `0`.
     - The program's logic might correctly simulate this simple case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It fails to correctly determine the MEX in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
