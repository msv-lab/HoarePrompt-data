Output State: **`t` is either 1 or 2, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so if `t` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if `t` was initially 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
