To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `i` is used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`tc` is `x + 1`**: This indicates that `tc` is one more than the value of `x`. However, `x` is not explicitly mentioned in the rest of the initial state, so its exact value is unknown.
2. **`N` is greater than 0**: This tells us that `N` is a positive integer.
3. **`a` is the list of integers from the input**: `a` is a list of integers, but the specific integers are not provided.
4. **`cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`**: This means `cnt` is a dictionary-like object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
5. **If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1; otherwise, `t` remains 0**: This describes a condition where `t` is set to 1 if the count of `i` in `cnt` is 1, otherwise `t` is 0.
6. **The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0**: This indicates that `t` is either 2 or more, or `i` does not exist in `cnt` (i.e., `cnt[i]` is 0).

Given these conditions, let's deduce the value of `i`:
- Since `cnt[i]` is either 0 or `t` is 2 or more, and `t` is set to 1 only when `cnt[i]` is 1, it implies that `i` either does not exist in `cnt` or `cnt[i]` is greater than 1.
- However, the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, and there's no additional context to determine a specific value for `i`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, and it could be any integer that meets the conditions described (i.e., either not present in `cnt` or present with a count greater than 1).

Thus, the output of the `print(i)` statement is:

Output: **i (where i is an integer that is either not present in cnt or present with a count greater than 1)**
