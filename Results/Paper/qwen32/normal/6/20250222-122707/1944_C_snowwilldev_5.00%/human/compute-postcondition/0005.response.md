The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the `cnt` defaultdict by 1. The values of `t`, `N`, `a`, and the other elements in `cnt` remain unchanged except for the count of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `N` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
