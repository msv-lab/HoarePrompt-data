The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. This means that if `a[i]` is already a key in `cnt`, its value is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not a key in `cnt`, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 1.

Given the initial state, `N` must be greater than 0, and this condition remains unchanged. The only change is in the dictionary `cnt` where the count of `a[i]` is updated.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0; `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
