Output State: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is an integer greater than `x + 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `i` is `N`, `t` is `t + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
