The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `cnt[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tc` is `x + 1`, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `t` is 1, and `cnt[i]` is 1.**
