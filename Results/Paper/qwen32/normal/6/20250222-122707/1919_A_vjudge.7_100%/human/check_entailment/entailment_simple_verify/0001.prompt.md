You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is equal to `test` (i.e., the loop has finished all its iterations), `test` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd. The loop has executed `test` times, and for each execution, it printed either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` was even or odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the strategy and the logic behind the game.

### Key Insight:
The game revolves around the total number of coins (a + b). The player who starts the game (Alice) can always force a win if the total number of coins is odd, and Bob can always force a win if the total number of coins is even. This is because:

- **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):** If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always face a situation where Bob can mirror her moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob can swap back, and if Alice removes a coin from her wallet, Bob can do the same to his wallet, ensuring that Bob always has a move until Alice is left with no coins.
  
- **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):** If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can ensure she always leaves Bob with an even number of coins after her move. Since Bob will always face an even number of coins, he will eventually be left with no coins, making Alice the winner.

### Program Analysis:
The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the total number of coins (a + b):

- If `a + b` is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob", indicating that Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd (`a + b & 1 != 0`), it prints "Alice", indicating that Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy described above. Therefore, the program is correct.
