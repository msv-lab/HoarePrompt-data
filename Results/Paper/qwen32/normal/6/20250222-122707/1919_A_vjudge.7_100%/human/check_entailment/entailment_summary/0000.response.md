Reasoning:

The problem at hand is a combinatorial game theory problem where the outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The core of the problem is to determine the winner when both players play optimally.

Here's the key insight: the game can be analyzed based on the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because the game is essentially about making the last move, and the parity of the total coins dictates who can force the opponent into a losing position.

Let's break down the logic:
1. If the total number of coins is even, Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves until there are exactly two coins left. The player who faces two coins will lose because they must take one, leaving one coin for the opponent, who can then take the last coin and win. Since Alice goes first, Bob can always mirror her moves to ensure that he is the one to face two coins, thus winning the game.
2. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that there is an odd number of coins left after her move. This forces Bob into a position where he faces an even number of coins, and he will eventually be forced to face two coins, leading to Alice's victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` and printing 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. This approach is efficient and works within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
