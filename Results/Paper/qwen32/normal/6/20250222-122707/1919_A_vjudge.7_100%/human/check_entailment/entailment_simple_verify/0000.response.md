### Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a detailed and correct analysis of the problem and the program. The key observation that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`) is accurate. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The game involves two players who take turns either swapping wallets or removing a coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an even number of coins on her turn, leading to Bob's win.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an odd number of coins on his turn, leading to Alice's win.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It checks the parity of the sum of the coins using `a + b & 1` (which is equivalent to `a + b % 2`).
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd (`a + b & 1 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification**:
   - The program is verified with the provided examples, and all outputs match the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy and handles all test cases as per the problem description. The annotations provided further confirm that the program's behavior aligns with the expected outcomes.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
