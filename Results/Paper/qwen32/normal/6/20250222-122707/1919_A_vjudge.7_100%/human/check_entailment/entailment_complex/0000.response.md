### Reasoning:
The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. The key insight is that the game can be analyzed using the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Both players take turns.
   - In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from the current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will win.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice will win.

3. **Explanation**:
   - When the total number of coins is even, the player who starts (Alice) will always be in a position where she leaves an odd number of coins after her move. This forces Bob to always face an odd number of coins, and eventually, Alice will be able to make the last move, leaving Bob with zero coins and thus Bob loses.
   - Conversely, when the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always leave an even number of coins after her move, forcing Bob to face an even number of coins. Eventually, Bob will be forced to make the last move, leaving Alice with zero coins, and thus Alice wins.

4. **Implementation**:
   - The code correctly checks the parity of the sum of the coins in the wallets using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd (`a + b & 1 == 1`), it prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, following the optimal play strategy. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.
Correctness: **True**
