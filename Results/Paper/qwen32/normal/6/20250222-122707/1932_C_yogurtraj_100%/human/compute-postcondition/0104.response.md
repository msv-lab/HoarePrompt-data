Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers from the latest input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in the new `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k`, `i` is 0, and the first character of `t` is 'R'. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`. The current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**
