The code `l = t.count('L')` counts the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`. The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `l` is introduced with the count of 'L's in `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`.**
