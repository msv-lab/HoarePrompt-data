The code snippet `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input and must be at least 2, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `(k * a[q2]) % m`, `q1` and `q2` are calculated based on the conditions provided, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the first and last elements being `k`, `i` is 1, `q2` is incremented by 1.**
