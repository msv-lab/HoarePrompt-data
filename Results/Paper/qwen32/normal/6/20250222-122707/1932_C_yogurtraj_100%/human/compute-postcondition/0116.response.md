The value of `q1` is decremented by 1. The other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **The first element of `y` is now `k * a[q1+1] % m`, while the last element of `y` remains `k * a[q1+1] % m`. All other variables retain their initial values, `i` is `n-3`, `n` remains the same, and `k` is `k * a[q1+1] % m`. `q1` is decreased by 1.**
