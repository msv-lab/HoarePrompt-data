Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`. `left` is a list containing the single element `0`. `last` is `[-1]`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. The current element `a[i]` is not equal to the previous element `a[i - 1]`.**
