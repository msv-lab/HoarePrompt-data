The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables directly but changes the control flow by moving to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, none of the variables' values will change due to the `continue` statement itself. The loop will simply proceed to its next iteration.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**

In natural language: The values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, `ans`, `x`, `inx`, `inx2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The loop will proceed to its next iteration.
