The `continue` statement in the given context does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of all variables remains the same.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` and all other elements are `-1`, and `last` is unchanged. The current element `a[i]` is less than the previous element `a[i - 1]`.**
