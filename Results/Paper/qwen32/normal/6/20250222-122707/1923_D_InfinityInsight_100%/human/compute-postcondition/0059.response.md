Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is `last[i - 1]`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The variable `inx` is now set to the value of `inx2`, which is `last[i - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
