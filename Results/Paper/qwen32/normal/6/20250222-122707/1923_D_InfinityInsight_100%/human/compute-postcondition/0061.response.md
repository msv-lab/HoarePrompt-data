Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx2` is updated to `last[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
