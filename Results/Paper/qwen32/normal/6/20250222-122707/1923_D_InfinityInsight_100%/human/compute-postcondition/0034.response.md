Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]` and all other elements are `-1`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is `last[i - 1]`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `inx2` is less than `inx`.**

In this output state, the value of `inx` has been updated to be equal to `inx2`, which is `last[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
