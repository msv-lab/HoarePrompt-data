The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables but moves the control back to the top of the loop for the next iteration. 

Given the initial state, none of the variables are affected by the `continue` statement. The values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, `ans`, `x`, `inx`, `inx2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The loop simply proceeds to the next iteration.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is `last[i - 1]`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `inx2 < inx` is true, then `inx` is updated to `inx2`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
