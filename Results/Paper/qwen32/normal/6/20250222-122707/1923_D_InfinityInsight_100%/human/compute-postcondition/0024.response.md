To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a` and appends the cumulative sum to the list `left`. Specifically, `left` starts with `[0]`, and after each iteration, the new element is the sum of the last element in `left` and the current element `i` from `a`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, let's deduce the final state after all iterations.

### Initial State
- `a`: List of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n`: Length of `a` (number of slimes).
- `left`: `[0]`
- `ans`: List of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`.
- `last`: List starting with `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the index of changes in `a`.

### Loop Iteration Analysis
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `i = a[0]`
   - `left` becomes `[0, a[0]]`
   
2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `i = a[1]`
   - `left` becomes `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1]]`

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `i = a[2]`
   - `left` becomes `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], a[0] + a[1] + a[2]]`

Following this pattern, after all `n` iterations, the `left` list will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, starting with `0`.

### Final State
- `a`: Remains the same list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n`: Remains the length of `a`.
- `left`: `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], a[0] + a[1] + a[2], ..., a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n-1]]`
- `ans`: Remains a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`.
- `last`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion
The final state of the loop after all iterations is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a`, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to `-1`, and `last` is unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop completes, `left` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, starting with `0`. All other variables (`a`, `n`, `ans`, and `last`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
