Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, and `ans` is a list of `n` elements. If `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, the `i`-th element of `ans` is set to `1` and all other elements are `-1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains a list of `n` elements all initialized to `-1`.**
