The code snippet assigns the value `left[i] - a[i] - 1` to the variable `x`. The values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, and `ans` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]` and all other elements are `-1`, and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.**
