Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`; `left` is a list containing the single element `0`; `last` is `[-1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. Additionally, `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`**
