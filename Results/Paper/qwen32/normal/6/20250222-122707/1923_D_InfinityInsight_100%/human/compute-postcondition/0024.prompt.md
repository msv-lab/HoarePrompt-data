Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the single element `0`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    left.append(left[-1] + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i, left[-1] + i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element; `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i, left[-1] + i, left[-1] + 2*i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`; `i` is the second element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
