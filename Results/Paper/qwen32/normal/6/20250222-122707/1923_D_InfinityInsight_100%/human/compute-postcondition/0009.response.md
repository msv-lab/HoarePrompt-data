The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `a` and `n > 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2 and `n` will remain the same.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`. `left` is a list containing the single element `0`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, i]`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]` and `last` is `[-1, -1]`. `i` is 2**
