Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 3`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is a list containing the elements `[0, 3]`. Otherwise, `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, 0]`.**
