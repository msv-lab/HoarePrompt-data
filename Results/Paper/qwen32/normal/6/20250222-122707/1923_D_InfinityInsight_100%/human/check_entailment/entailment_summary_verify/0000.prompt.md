You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)

    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes such that `n` equals the length of `a` and is at least 1. It returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where each element is `1` if the size of the current slime is less than the size of the previous slime, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by the conditions within the loop.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime can be eaten by either of its neighbors, and it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and compare it to the problem description:

1. **Initialization and Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, x)`: This function is intended to find the index in the list `a` where the value is greater than `x`. However, it does not handle the case where `x` is not found correctly and can return incorrect indices.
   - `func_2(a, n)`: This function is supposed to compute the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten. However, it does not correctly handle the logic for slimes that can be eaten by either of their neighbors.

2. **Main Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The code initializes `left` with cumulative sums of the slime sizes and `last` to keep track of the last occurrence of a different slime size.
   - It then iterates over the slimes to determine if a slime can eat its left neighbor. If it can, it sets the answer to 1.
   - For slimes that cannot eat their left neighbor, it attempts to find the correct index using `func_1` and `last`. However, this logic is flawed and does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime can be eaten by either of its neighbors.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where a slime can be eaten by either of its neighbors. For example, in the input `[2, 2, 3, 1, 1]`, the third slime (size 3) can be eaten by the second slime (size 2) or the fourth slime (size 1). The current code does not correctly handle such scenarios.
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where a slime cannot be eaten at all, which should result in `-1`.

Let's consider a specific test case that the program does not handle correctly:

**Test Case**:
```
3
5
2 2 3 1 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```

**Actual Output** (as per the provided code):
The provided code might not produce the correct output due to the flawed logic in handling the scenarios mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
