The value of `a` is updated to the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is the value of `l[x]`; `b` is positive infinity; `c` is 0. The element at index `x` in `l` is less than or equal to `a`.**
