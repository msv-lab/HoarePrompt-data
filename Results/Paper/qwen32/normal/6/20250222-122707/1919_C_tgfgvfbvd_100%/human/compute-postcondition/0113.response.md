Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x]`, `l[x-1]`, or `float('inf')`, `b` is either `l[x]` or `l[x-2]` or `float('inf')`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2 or 3, and `n` is greater than 0. If `l[x] <= b`, then `a` becomes `l[x]` and `c` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `a` remains either `l[x]` or `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')`, `b` is `l[x]`, and `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. In both cases, `x` remains unchanged.**
