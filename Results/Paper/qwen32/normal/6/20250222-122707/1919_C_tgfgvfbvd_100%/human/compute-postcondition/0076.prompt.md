Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer provided by the input, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` remains 0. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`, `a` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` remains 0. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is set to `float('inf')`, and `c` is updated to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, and `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is `l[x-1]`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` was originally greater than `b`, then `a` holds the original value of `b` and `b` holds the original value of `a`; otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` was less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` was greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` was greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` was originally greater than `b` (before any updates), then `a` and `b` are swapped; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
