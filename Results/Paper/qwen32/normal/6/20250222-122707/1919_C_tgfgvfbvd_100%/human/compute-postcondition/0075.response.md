Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` was less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` was greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` was greater than `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` was originally greater than `b` (before any updates), then `a` and `b` are swapped; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values.**

In simpler terms: **`t` and `n` retain their original values, `l` remains the same, and `x` is incremented by 1. Depending on the value of `l[x]`, `a` and `b` are updated accordingly, and if `a` was originally greater than `b`, they are swapped. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, `c` is incremented by 1.**
