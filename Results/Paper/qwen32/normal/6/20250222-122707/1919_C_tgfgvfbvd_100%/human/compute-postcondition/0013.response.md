The value of `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is positive infinity; `b` is `l[x]`; `c` is 0. Additionally, `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**
