The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is positive infinity and `b` is positive infinity, but it is given that `a` is greater than `b`, which implies that `a` and `b` must have distinct values for this condition to hold true. After the swap, `a` will take the value of `b` and `b` will take the value of `a`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified beyond being positive infinity and `a` being greater than `b`, we can denote their swapped values as `b` taking the value of `a` (positive infinity) and `a` taking the value of `b` (positive infinity), but with the condition reversed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is positive infinity; `b` is positive infinity; `c` is 0; `b` is greater than `a`.**
