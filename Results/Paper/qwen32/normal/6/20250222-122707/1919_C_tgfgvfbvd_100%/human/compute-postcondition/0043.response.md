The code snippet provided resets the variable `c` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer provided by the input, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0**.
