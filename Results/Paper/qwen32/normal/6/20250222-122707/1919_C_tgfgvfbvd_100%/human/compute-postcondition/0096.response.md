Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x]` or `float('inf')`, `b` is either `l[x]` or `float('inf')`, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then `a` remains `float('inf')` and `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is set to `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.**
