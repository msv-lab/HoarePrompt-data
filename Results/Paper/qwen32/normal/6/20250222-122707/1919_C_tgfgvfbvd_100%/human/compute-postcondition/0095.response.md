Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` and `b` are either `float('inf')` or the element at index `x` of `l`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the element at index `x` of `l` is greater than `a`. Specifically, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is set to `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.**
