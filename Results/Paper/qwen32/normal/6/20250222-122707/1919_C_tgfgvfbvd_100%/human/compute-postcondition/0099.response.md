Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')`, `b` is either `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')`, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a` was greater than `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. `x` is `x + 1`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values. `x` is still `x + 1`.**
