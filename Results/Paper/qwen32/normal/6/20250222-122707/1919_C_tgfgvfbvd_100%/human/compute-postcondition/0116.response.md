To determine the output of the `print(c)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the initial state provided.

1. **Variable `b`**: It is defined as the smallest element in the list `l`.
2. **Variable `a`**: It is defined as the second smallest element in the list `l`, or the smallest if all elements are the same. This means that `a` could be equal to `b` if all elements in the list are identical.
3. **Variable `c`**: It is defined as the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are either the smallest and second smallest or both the smallest (if all elements are the same), `c` will count the number of elements that are strictly greater than the smallest (or second smallest) element in the list.

Given the initial state, the value of `c` will be the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the smallest (or second smallest) element in the list.

Since the exact list `l` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated count of elements greater than both `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be the count `c` of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`)**
