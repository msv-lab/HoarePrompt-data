The code snippet assigns the value `float('inf')` to both `a` and `b`. This means that `a` and `b` are now set to positive infinity. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, the smallest value in `l`, the second smallest value in `l`, and the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer provided by the input, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`**.
