The code snippet provided swaps the values of `a` and `b`. However, the initial state does not mention the initial values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, we cannot specify their exact values after the swap. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `x`) are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is incremented by 1; `a` and `b` have their values swapped.**
