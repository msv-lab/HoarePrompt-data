### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert requires a tent by themselves.
   - Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two others, meaning each tent for extroverts can have 1 extrovert + 2 others (either introverts or universals).
   - Universals can fit in any configuration.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - It then calls `func_2` with these values.
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - `func_1` determines if it's possible to accommodate extroverts with the help of universals:
     - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, there will be a remainder (either 1 or 2).
     - If the remainder is 1, at least 2 universals are needed to make up a group of 3.
     - If the remainder is 2, at least 1 universal is needed.
     - If the remaining extroverts and universals can form groups of 3, `func_1` returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.
     - If it's impossible to form groups of 3 with the remaining extroverts and universals, `func_1` returns `None`.
   - `func_2` adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` or returns -1 if `func_1` returned `None`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly handles the requirement for introverts (each needing their own tent).
   - The logic correctly handles the requirement for extroverts (each needing a tent with two others).
   - The logic correctly handles the requirement for universals (who can fit in any configuration).
   - The program correctly returns -1 if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

4. **Verifying with Examples:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of tents for the given examples in the problem statement.
   - It handles edge cases such as no participants, only introverts, only extroverts, and only universals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
