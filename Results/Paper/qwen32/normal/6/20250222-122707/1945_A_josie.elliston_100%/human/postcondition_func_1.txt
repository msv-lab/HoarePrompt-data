The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns -1 if a helper function `func_1` returns `None` when called with the extroverts and universals as arguments; otherwise, it returns the sum of the introverts and the value returned by `func_1`.
