To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze whether it correctly computes the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or returns -1 if it's impossible.

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to allocate tents based on the preferences of participants:
- **Introverts** (a) must each be in a tent alone.
- **Extroverts** (b) must each be in a tent with exactly two others.
- **Universals** (c) can be in a tent alone, with one other, or with two others.

The key points to consider are:
1. Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two others.
2. Each introvert requires a tent alone.
3. Universals are flexible but need to be used to fulfill the conditions of extroverts first if possible.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:** This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, ensuring that extroverts can be placed in tents with two others.
2. **`func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:** This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the tents for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`

- **Logic:** It first checks if the number of extroverts (`extroverts % 3 != 0`). If the extroverts cannot form complete groups of three, it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can form a complete group of three. If not, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to allocate tents for extroverts.
- **Implementation:** Uses `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` to calculate the number of tents required for extroverts and universals, which is correct as it ensures that any leftover extroverts and universals are accounted for.

#### Function `func_2`

- **Logic:** It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to allocate tents for extroverts, and it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it adds the number of tents for introverts (which is simply the number of introverts, as each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1`.
- **Implementation:** Correctly handles the addition of tents for introverts and checks for impossibility.

### Testing the Solution

Let's test the solution with a couple of examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - Calculation:
     - `func_1(2, 3)`:
       - `2 % 3 != 0` (True)
       - `2 % 3 + 3 = 5 >= 3` (True)
       - `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`
     - `func_2(1, 2, 3)`:
       - `ret = 2` (from `func_1`)
       - `return 1 + 2 = 3`
   - Result: `3` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `1 4 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `func_1(4, 1)`:
       - `4 % 3 != 0` (True)
       - `4 % 3 + 1 = 2 < 3` (False)
       - `return None`
     - `func_2(1, 4, 1)`:
       - `ret = None` (from `func_1`)
       - `return -1`
   - Result: `-1` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Thus, the solution is correct.
