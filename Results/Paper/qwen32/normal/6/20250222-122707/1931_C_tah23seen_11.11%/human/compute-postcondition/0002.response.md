To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition `i <= j`. The variables `i` and `j` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the problem constraints.

Given:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i <= j` must be true. Let's analyze the possible states of `i` and `j`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i <= j`.

Since `i` is 0, for the condition `i <= j` to be true, `j` must be at least 0. Given that `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, `j` will be at least 0 if `len(arr)` is at least 1.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The list `arr` must have at least one element to ensure `j` is at least 0, making the condition `i <= j` true.

No other states need to be adjusted because the problem only allows modifying the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `j`), and the condition directly depends on the length of `arr`.

**Final State:**
State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`**
