The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input, where the first element represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. The function returns 0 if all elements in the array of a test case are the same. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray where at least two consecutive elements are different.
