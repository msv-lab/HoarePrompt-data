Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program is attempting to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by applying the operation at most once. However, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios.

Here are some issues with the provided program:
1. The function only checks if the array can be made equal by applying the operation on the ends of the array where the elements are the same. It does not consider cases where the operation needs to be applied in the middle of the array.
2. The function does not handle cases where the array can be made equal by selecting a different subarray to change.
3. The function does not consider the possibility of making the entire array equal to a single element by changing the minimum number of elements.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to consider all possible values that the array could be made equal to and calculate the cost of making the array equal to that value using the operation at most once. This would involve checking the cost of changing the array to the most frequent element or to an element that minimizes the cost of the operation.
