Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem asks to find the minimum cost in burles to make all elements of an array equal, where the operation allowed is to set a range of elements to a given value, and the cost is the length of that range.

### Program Analysis
The provided program includes a main loop that reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling the function `func_1(arr)`. The `func_1` function is supposed to compute the minimum cost for each test case.

Let's break down the `func_1` function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is set to the start of the array (index 0).
   - `j` is set to the end of the array (index `len(arr) - 1`).

2. **Symmetric Check**:
   - The function enters a while loop where it checks if the elements at positions `i` and `j` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it moves `i` to the right and `j` to the left.
   - If they are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Fully Symmetric Case**:
   - If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it means the entire array is symmetric (all elements are the same), and the function returns `0` as no operation is needed.

4. **Finding the Range to Change**:
   - If the array is not fully symmetric, the function finds the first position `i` where the elements are not the same as the next element.
   - It then checks if `j` is not at the end of the array. If not, it returns the cost to change the range from `i` to `j`, which is `j - i + 1`.
   - If `j` is at the end of the array, it still returns `j - i`, which is equivalent to `j - i + 1 - 1`. However, this case seems incorrect as it should handle the last element properly.

### Issues in the Program
- The program does not correctly handle cases where the array is not fully symmetric but can be made symmetric with a single operation.
- The logic for finding the range to change is flawed. It does not consider the possibility of changing a range that starts from the beginning or ends at the end of the array.
- The program does not consider the possibility of changing a range that is not at the edges of the array but somewhere in the middle.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It fails to consider all possible ways to make the array symmetric with a single operation and does not handle edge cases properly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
