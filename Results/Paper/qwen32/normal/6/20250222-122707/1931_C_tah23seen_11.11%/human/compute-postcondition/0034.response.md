Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` of `arr` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first integer `n` is followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. The function returns 0 if all elements in the array are the same. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray where at least two consecutive elements are different.**
