To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `i <= j`. 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Condition of the Loop**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `j` are indices such that `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
3. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the current iteration, `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.

Given the loop body description:
- If `arr[i] == arr[j]`, then `i` is increased by 1 and `j` is decreased by 1. This operation will naturally maintain the condition `i <= j` as long as `i` was less than `j` before the increment and decrement.
- If `arr[i] != arr[j]`, the loop breaks, and `i` and `j` remain such that `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

Since the loop body operations ensure that `i` and `j` will still satisfy `i <= j` after the operations if they were valid before, we don't need to adjust `i` and `j` explicitly unless we want to ensure that they are in a state where the loop can definitely execute again.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further to ensure the loop can execute one more time, as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`arr` is an array, `i` and `j` are indices such that `i` is less than or equal to `j`**
