The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `arr[i]` was set to be equal to `arr[i + 1]` before the increment, the new value of `i` will still satisfy the condition that `i` is a valid index and `i + 1` is also a valid index. The state of the array `arr` remains unchanged except for the fact that `arr[i]` was updated to `arr[i + 1]` before `i` was incremented.

Output State: **`i` is a valid index such that `i + 1` is also a valid index, and `arr[i - 1]` is set to be equal to `arr[i]`**.
