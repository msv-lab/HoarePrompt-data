### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the provided function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the minimum cost (in burles) to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation where a contiguous subarray can be set to a given value. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

#### Program Analysis
The program consists of a main loop that processes each test case by calling the function `func_1(arr)`. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimum cost for each test case.

Let's break down the `func_1` function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is initialized to the start of the array (index 0).
   - `j` is initialized to the end of the array (index `len(arr) - 1`).

2. **Symmetric Check**:
   - The function enters a while loop where it checks if the elements at positions `i` and `j` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it moves `i` to the right and `j` to the left.
   - If they are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Fully Symmetric Case**:
   - If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it means the entire array is symmetric (all elements are the same), and the function returns `0` as no operation is needed.

4. **Finding the Range to Change**:
   - If the array is not fully symmetric, the function finds the first position `i` where the elements are not the same as the next element.
   - It then checks if `j` is not at the end of the array. If not, it returns the cost to change the range from `i` to `j`, which is `j - i + 1`.
   - If `j` is at the end of the array, it returns `j - i`, which is equivalent to `j - i + 1 - 1`. This seems incorrect as it should handle the last element properly.

#### Issues in the Program
The provided function summary and the code itself do not correctly address the problem. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Symmetric Check**:
   - The symmetric check only checks if the elements at the start and end are equal and moves inward. This does not guarantee that the array can be made uniform with one operation.

2. **Range Calculation**:
   - The logic for finding the range to change is flawed. The function does not consider the possibility of changing a range that starts from the beginning or ends at the end of the array.
   - The function does not consider the possibility of changing a range that is not at the edges of the array but somewhere in the middle.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where the array can be made uniform by changing a subarray that is not at the edges.

#### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It fails to consider all possible ways to make the array uniform with a single operation and does not handle edge cases properly.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
