Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation allows setting a contiguous subarray to a single value, with the cost being the length of that subarray.

The logic in `func_1` is designed to find the longest contiguous subarray where the elements are not the same at the start and end, and then determine the minimum cost to make the array uniform by setting the differing parts to the same value. However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. 

Here are some issues with the current implementation:
1. The function does not correctly handle cases where the array can be made uniform by setting a subarray in the middle of the array. For example, in the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the optimal solution is to change the subarray `[1, 2]` to `8`, costing 2 burles. The current function would incorrectly return `6` because it only considers the longest subarray with differing ends.
2. The function does not consider the possibility of setting the entire array to a single value if the cost is less than the cost of modifying a subarray.
3. The function does not handle the case where the array can be made uniform by setting the first or last segment to match the middle segment.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases.

Correctness: **False**
