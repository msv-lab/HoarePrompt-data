Output State: **`arr` is an array, `i` and `j` are indices, `i` must be less than or equal to `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `arr`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
