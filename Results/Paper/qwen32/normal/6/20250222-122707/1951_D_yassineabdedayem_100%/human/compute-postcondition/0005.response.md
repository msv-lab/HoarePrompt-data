The initial state provides information that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with the specific condition that `n` equals `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the execution of the `print` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
