Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- If `n` equals `k`, no further changes are made to `n` or `k`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is determined:
  - If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, that relationship holds.
  - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`. The precondition does not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
