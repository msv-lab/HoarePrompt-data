The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply outputs the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) and their relationships, but these variables do not affect the execution of the `print(2)` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `t` is given to be greater than 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The values of `n` and `k` are described based on the input, and their relationship is defined, but these values are also not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print(2)` statement directly outputs the integer `2` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
