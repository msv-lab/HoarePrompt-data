The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the initial state's condition about `t` being greater than 0 is not affected by this code snippet since `t` is not involved in the operations.

The initial state's condition about the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is also not affected by this code snippet because the values of `n` and `k` are being reassigned here, and the relationship is described based on the original values of `n` and `k` before this reassignment.

After the code snippet executes, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input.**
