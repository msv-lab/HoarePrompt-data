The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(2)`.
2. The integer `2` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The initial state describes the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these are not referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
