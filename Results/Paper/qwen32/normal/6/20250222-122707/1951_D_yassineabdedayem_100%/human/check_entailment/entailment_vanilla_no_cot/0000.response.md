Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. The logic used in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the full range of possible values for `n` and `k`, especially when `k` is large.

Here's an analysis of the current logic and why it fails:

1. **Case `n == k`:** This case is correctly handled. If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she needs to buy, she can buy one jewel for 1 coin each, and this can be done in a single stall.

2. **Case `n + 2 > k * 2`:** This condition is not well-founded. It assumes that if `n` is just a little more than `k * 2`, then it's possible to set up two stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels. This is not necessarily true and does not consider the number of stalls or the pricing strategy required.

3. **General Case:** The program does not handle the general case correctly, especially when `k` is large and requires more than two stalls or when the coins `n` are not just slightly more than `k * 2`. The problem requires setting up to 60 stalls with appropriate prices to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible strategy is to use the binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and the prices for each stall. This way, you can ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting the prices such that she buys one jewel from each stall corresponding to a `1` in the binary representation of `k`.

Here is an example of how the correct solution might look:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(0)
        else:
            prices = []
            remaining_k = k
            power_of_two = 1
            while remaining_k > 0:
                if remaining_k % 2 == 1:
                    prices.append(power_of_two)
                remaining_k //= 2
                power_of_two *= 2
            if sum(prices) <= n:
                print('YES')
                print(len(prices))
                print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This solution uses the binary representation of `k` to determine the prices for the stalls. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall for each `1` in the binary representation of `k`. The sum of the prices should not exceed `n` to ensure that Alice can indeed buy the jewels.
