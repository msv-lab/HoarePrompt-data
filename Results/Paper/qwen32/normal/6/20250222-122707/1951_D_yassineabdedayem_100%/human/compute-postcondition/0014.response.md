The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides specific conditions about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, and `n` and `k` are integers. Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which directly outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
