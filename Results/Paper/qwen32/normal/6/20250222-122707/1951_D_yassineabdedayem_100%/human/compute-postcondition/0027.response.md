Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input. If `n` equals `k`, no further changes are made to `n` or `k`. Otherwise, the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is determined: if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, that relationship holds; otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
