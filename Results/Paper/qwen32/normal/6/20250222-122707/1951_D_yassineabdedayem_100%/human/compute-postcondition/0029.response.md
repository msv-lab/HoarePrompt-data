The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. However, since `_` is not used in the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input. If `n` equals `k`, no further changes are made to `n` or `k`. Otherwise, the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is determined: if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, that relationship holds; otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
