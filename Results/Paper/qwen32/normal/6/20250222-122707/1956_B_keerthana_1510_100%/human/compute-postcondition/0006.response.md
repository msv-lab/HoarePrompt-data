To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes the input.

The loop processes the input file in a specific way:
1. It skips the first two lines of the input file (the first line is an integer `n` and the second line is a sequence of `n` integers).
2. It then processes every second line thereafter, calculating the difference between the number of tokens in the line and the number of unique tokens in the line.
3. This difference is printed for each processed line.

Given the loop's behavior, the output state after all iterations will be the set of printed differences for each line processed by the loop.

To formalize this, let's denote:
- The total number of lines in the input file as `T`.
- The number of lines processed by the loop as `P`, which is `(T - 2) // 2` (since the loop starts from the third line and processes every second line thereafter).

The output state will contain `P` printed values, each representing the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens in the respective lines processed by the loop.

Since the exact input content is not provided, we cannot compute the specific numerical differences. However, we can describe the output state in terms of what it will contain.

Output State: **A series of printed integers, each representing the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens in the respective lines processed by the loop, starting from the third line and processing every second line thereafter.**

In simpler terms, the output state will be a list of integers where each integer is the count of duplicate tokens in every second line starting from the third line of the input file.
