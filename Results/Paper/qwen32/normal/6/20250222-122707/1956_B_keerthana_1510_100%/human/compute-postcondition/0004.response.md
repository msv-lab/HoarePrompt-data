The only object in the loop head is the variable `line`. The loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line of the input file. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `line` must be updated to the next line in the sequence, which is two lines ahead from the current `line`.

Given that `line` now contains valid input data from the next line in the sequence (skipping one line), the next iteration will naturally take the line that is two lines ahead from the current `line`.

State: **The input file must have at least three lines, where the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), and the third line (which was `line` in the first iteration of the loop) contains valid input data. `line` now contains valid input data from the next line in the sequence (skipping one line).** 

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `line` should be updated to the next line in the sequence, which is two lines ahead from the current `line`.

Since the loop inherently handles this by iterating over every second line starting from the third line, no explicit adjustment to `line` is needed in the state description. The state already implies that `line` will be the correct next line in the sequence for the next iteration.
