Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell.**
