The only object in the loop head is the variable `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, `s` is assigned to each line of the input starting from the second line in each iteration of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `s` was the first line of input starting from the second line. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be the next line of input.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `s` is the next line of input starting from the second line, `n` is the first integer from the split of `s`, `k` is the second integer from the split of `s`.**
