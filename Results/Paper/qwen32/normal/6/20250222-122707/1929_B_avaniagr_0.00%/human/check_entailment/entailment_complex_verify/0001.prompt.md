You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The output state after all iterations is the series of computed values for each test case, each printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions related to the size of a square grid `n` and the minimum number of diagonals `k` that should have at least one colored cell.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires coloring the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell. There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Diagonals**: 
   - There are \( n \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (let's call these "main diagonals").
   - There are \( n \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (let's call these "anti-diagonals").
   - The total number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Minimum Coloring**:
   - To cover the minimum number of diagonals, we can start by coloring cells in the main diagonals and anti-diagonals.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can color cells in the main and anti-diagonals alternately to cover \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells.
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover additional diagonals which will require more cells.

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the given code to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

#### Explanation of the Code:
- **Expression Breakdown**:
  - `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the minimum number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals when \( k < 4n - 3 \). It essentially calculates \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \) which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring cells in alternating diagonals.
  - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part covers the scenario when \( k \geq 4n - 3 \). In this case, we need to cover almost all diagonals, and the minimum number of cells required is \( 2n \).
  - `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part adds an additional cell to cover the last diagonal when \( k = 4n - 2 \).

#### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1**: \( k < 4n - 3 \)
  - The code correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed by covering diagonals alternately.
- **Case 2**: \( k = 4n - 2 \)
  - The code correctly handles this edge case by adding an additional cell.
- **Case 3**: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)
  - The code correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed as \( 2n \) since almost all diagonals need to be covered.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the problem and the code, it appears that the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least \( k \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
