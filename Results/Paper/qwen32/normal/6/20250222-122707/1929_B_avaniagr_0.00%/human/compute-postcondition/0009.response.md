To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the output is generated for each test case.

The loop processes each test case one by one, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. The loop calculates and prints a specific value based on the conditions involving `n` and `k`.

The expression inside the loop is:
```python
(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
```

Let's break down the expression:
1. `(k // 2 + k % 2)` calculates the ceiling of `k / 2`.
2. `(k < 4 * n - 3)` is a boolean condition that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false.
3. `(k >= 4 * n - 3)` is another boolean condition that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false.
4. `(k == 4 * n - 2)` is a boolean condition that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false.

The loop reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it computes and prints the value based on the above expression.

After all iterations, the output state will be the concatenation of the results of each test case, each printed on a new line.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state of `t` and the input lines does not change within the loop body, the final output state will be the series of outputs for each test case.

Output State: **The output state after all iterations is the series of computed values for each test case, each printed on a new line.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing all the iterations, the output will be a list of results, one for each test case, with each result printed on a separate line.
