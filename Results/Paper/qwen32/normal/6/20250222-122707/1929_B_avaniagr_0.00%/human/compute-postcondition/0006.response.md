The only object in the loop head is the variable `s`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input file having more lines after the current line. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is the next line of input starting from the second line. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be the subsequent line of input from the file.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `s` is the next line of input starting from the third line, `n` is the first integer from the split of `s`, `k` is the second integer from the split of `s`**
