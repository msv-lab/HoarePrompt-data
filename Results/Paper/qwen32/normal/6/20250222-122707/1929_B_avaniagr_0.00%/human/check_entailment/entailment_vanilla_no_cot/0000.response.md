Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color is flawed. The program attempts to use a combination of integer division and modulo operations to determine the result, but it does not account for all possible scenarios where the number of diagonals `k` might be less than, equal to, or greater than certain thresholds related to `n`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. For `k <= n`, we can cover `k` diagonals by coloring `k` cells along the main diagonal.
2. For `k > n`, we need to cover more diagonals. The optimal strategy is to color cells in such a way that we cover as many diagonals as possible with the minimum number of cells. This involves coloring cells along the main diagonal and possibly some additional cells in other diagonals.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= n:
            print(k)
        else:
            # We need to cover more than n diagonals
            # Cover the main diagonal (n cells)
            # We need to cover (k - n) more diagonals
            # Each additional cell can cover at most 2 diagonals
            additional_cells = (k - n + 1) // 2
            print(n + additional_cells)

func()
```

This approach ensures that we cover the required number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells.
