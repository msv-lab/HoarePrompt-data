To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the binary search-like loop. The loop is adjusting the values of `beg` and `end` based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. The loop continues until `beg` is no longer less than `end`.

Given the initial state:
- `beg` is 1
- `end` is `n`

The loop updates `beg` and `end` in the following manner:
- If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, `beg` is set to `mid`.
- If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is False, `end` is set to `mid - 1`.

The loop will terminate when `beg` is no longer less than `end`, meaning `beg` will be equal to `end`.

The final state of `beg` and `end` will be the same, and it will represent the largest value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True.

Output State: **`beg` is equal to `end`, and both are the largest integer for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True.**

In simpler terms: The loop will continue until `beg` and `end` converge to the same value, which is the largest value of `mid` for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns True.
