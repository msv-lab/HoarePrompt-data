Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `postorder` is `False`. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` and all tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list. Otherwise, `stack` remains an empty list. Since `postorder` is `True`, `stack` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children` after the previously processed `u`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
