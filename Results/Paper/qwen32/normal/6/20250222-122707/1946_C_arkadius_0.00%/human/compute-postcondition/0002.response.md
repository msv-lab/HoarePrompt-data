To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

Given the condition `1 <= k < n`, we know that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, because if `n` were 1, `k` would not satisfy the condition `1 <= k < n`.

The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized in the loop head. However, we need to ensure that `n` is set to a value that allows the loop to iterate at least once.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices**
