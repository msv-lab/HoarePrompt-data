Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `tree`, which is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, a parameter `s`, which is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, and a parameter `x`, which is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges. The function returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the vertex `s` in the `tree`.**
