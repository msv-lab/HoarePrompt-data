The method `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` is called on the `tree` object, which is expected to perform some operations to root the tree at vertex `0` with `-1` as its parent (indicating no parent). However, the exact implementation details of `root_tree_non_recursive` are not provided, so we can only infer that this method will modify the `tree` object in some way to establish a rooted tree structure.

Given that the method is called and no other variables are directly modified in the provided code snippet, we can assume that only the `tree` object might be changed. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and includes `n-1` additional edges between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`, where `u` and `v` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `tree` has been rooted at vertex `0` with `-1` as its parent.**
