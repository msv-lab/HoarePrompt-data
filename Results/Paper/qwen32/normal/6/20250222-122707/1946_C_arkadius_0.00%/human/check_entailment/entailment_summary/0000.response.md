### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - `Tree` class is used to represent the tree. It initializes a list of `TreeNode` objects.
   - `add_edge` method adds edges between vertices.
   - `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a specified vertex (vertex 0 in this case) using a non-recursive approach to avoid stack overflow for large trees.

2. **Component Calculation**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are both designed to calculate the number of "good components" and the remaining size of each vertex or subtree, respectively. Both functions traverse the tree and update these parameters based on the minimum size `x`.
   - The difference between `func_1` and `func_2` is the method of traversal (`func_1` uses an explicit stack for iterative DFS, while `func_2` is a recursive DFS). These functions are functionally equivalent for the given problem.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to split the tree into connected components, each with at least `x` vertices, by removing `k` edges. It uses the results from `func_1` (or `func_2`).

4. **Binary Search**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` for which `func_3` returns `True`. It starts with the range `[1, n]` and narrows it down based on the feasibility check.

5. **Main Function**:
   - `func_5` reads input values, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum number `x`.

### Correctness:
- The provided functions together address the problem by constructing the tree, rooting it, and then using a binary search approach to find the maximum size `x` of the connected components after removing `k` edges.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are equivalent and correctly implement the logic for calculating good components and remaining sizes.
- The function `func_3` correctly checks the feasibility of the split.
- The function `func_4` correctly performs the binary search to find the optimal `x`.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
