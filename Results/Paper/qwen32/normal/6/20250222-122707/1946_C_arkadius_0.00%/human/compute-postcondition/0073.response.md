Output State: **`v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)` and as many tuples `(u, False)` as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children` than before.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `stack` will have one additional tuple `(v, True)` compared to the initial state, and for each child `u` of `v` in the tree, there will be a corresponding tuple `(u, False)` in the `stack`. All other variables like `s`, `x`, and the structure of `tree` remain unchanged.
