Postcondition: **`v` is a vertex in `tree` and `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack` and is not empty, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` has one less tuple than before entering the if condition. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.**
