The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and includes an additional edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `u` and `v` are the two new integers read from the input, `i` is 3**
