Postcondition: **`v` is a vertex in `tree`, `postorder` is a boolean value, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped. If `postorder` is `True`, all children of `v` have been processed, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` reflects the sum of good components from all children of `v` plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` reflects the sum of `remaining_size` from all children of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is `False`, no further action is taken regarding `v` and its children.**
