You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children, v is an integer representing the current vertex, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each connected component.
def func_2(tree, v, x):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree = func_2(tree, u, x)
        
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
        
    #State: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure, `v` is an integer representing the current vertex, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `good_components` is the total count of good components accumulated from all iterations, and `remaining_size` is the final remaining size after all iterations.
    return good_components, remaining_size
    #The program returns `good_components`, which is the total count of good components accumulated from all iterations, and `remaining_size`, which is the final remaining size after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `tree`, which is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children; `v`, an integer representing the current vertex; and `x`, an integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. The function returns `good_components`, which is the total count of good components accumulated from all iterations, and `remaining_size`, which is the final remaining size after all iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `good_components`, which is the total count of good components accumulated from all iterations, and `remaining_size`, which is the final remaining size after all iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
