### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the critical flaw in the handling of Type 2 operations in the `func_1` function. Let's break down the issues and confirm the assessment:

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Appending Values (Type 1):**
   - The function correctly appends an integer `x` to the array when `op_type == 1`.

2. **Extending the Array (Type 2):**
   - The function incorrectly extends the array by appending it only once when `op_type == 2`. The correct behavior should be to append the array `x` times. The provided code:
     ```python
     array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
     ```
     only appends the array once, resulting in incorrect array expansion.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The function calculates the `k`-th element using `(k - 1) % len(array)`, which is correct if the array is built correctly. However, due to the incorrect handling of Type 2 operations, the array size and content are incorrect, leading to incorrect query results.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of operations and queries, the operations themselves, and the queries.

2. **Result Calculation:**
   - The function calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results. Since `func_1` is incorrect, the results from `func_2` will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The program is indeed incorrect because of the improper handling of Type 2 operations in `func_1`. The assessment correctly identifies this flaw and concludes that the program does not produce the correct results for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
