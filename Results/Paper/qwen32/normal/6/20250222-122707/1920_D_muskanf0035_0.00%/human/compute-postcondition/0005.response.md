To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does with the provided parameters. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only assume that it processes the `operations` and `queries` lists in some way and returns a result based on these inputs.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only change is that a new variable `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1`. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the given code snippet.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. Therefore, we can only state that `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list containing two integers `b` (1 or 2) and `x` (with `x` constrained by the value of `b`), `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
