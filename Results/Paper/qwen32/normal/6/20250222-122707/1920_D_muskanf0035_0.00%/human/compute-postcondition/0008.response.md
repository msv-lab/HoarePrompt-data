The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. The initial state indicates that `n` and `q` are positive integers read from the input, and other variables like `operations`, `queries`, `t`, and `result` are not affected by this code snippet.

The impact of the code is that `n` and `q` are now assigned specific values from the input. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list containing two integers `b` (1 or 2) and `x` (with `x` constrained by the value of `b`), `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0 and will be `t - 1`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
