### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly implements the problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements as operations are performed.
   - It also initializes an empty list `result` to store the answers for each query.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation, the program checks the type (`b`):
     - If `b = 1`, it appends the integer `x` to the end of `array`.
     - If `b = 2`, it attempts to extend `array` by repeating its current elements `x` times.
   - **Issue**: The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is incorrect for the described operation. This line simply doubles the array each time `b = 2`, but the problem statement specifies that `x` copies of the current array should be appended, not just 2 copies. The correct operation should be `array.extend(array * x)`, which repeats the entire array `x` times.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - After all operations, the program processes each query `k` by finding the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` in `array`. This correctly handles the wrapping around of indices if `k` is larger than the length of `array`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each query, which is correct based on the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it does not correctly handle the operation where `b = 2`. The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` should be replaced with `array.extend(array * x)` to ensure that `x` copies of the array are appended, as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
