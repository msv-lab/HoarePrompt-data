The provided code snippet reads `n` operations from the input and updates the `operations` list accordingly. Here's the impact on the variables:

- `n` remains the same as it is a positive integer read from the input.
- `q` remains the same as it is a positive integer read from the input.
- `operations` is updated to be a list of `n` operations, where each operation is a list containing two integers `b` (1 or 2) and `x` (with `x` constrained by the value of `b`).
- `queries` remains the same as it is a list of integers read from the input.
- `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1`.
- `result` remains the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)` and is not affected by this code snippet.

The Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` is `t - 1`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
