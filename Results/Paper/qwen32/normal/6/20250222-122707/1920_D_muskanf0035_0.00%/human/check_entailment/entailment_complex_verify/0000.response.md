### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Operations:**
   - Type 1: Append an integer \( x \) to the end of array \( a \).
   - Type 2: Append \( x \) copies of the current array \( a \) to the end of \( a \).

2. **Queries:**
   - For each query \( k \), return the \( k \)-th element of the final array \( a \).

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, operations, queries)`: Processes the operations and handles the queries.
- `func_2()`: Reads input, calls `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Key Issue in `func_1`:
The core issue lies in the handling of the second type of operation. The code currently appends only one copy of the array to itself instead of \( x \) copies.

#### Current Implementation:
```python
if op_type == 1:
    array.append(value)
else:
    array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```
This effectively does:
```python
array.extend(array)
```
which means it appends only one copy of the array to itself.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly handle the second type of operation, we need to append \( x \) copies of the array to itself. This can be done using:
```python
else:
    array *= x
```
or
```python
else:
    array.extend(array * (x - 1))
```

#### Annotations and Evaluation:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points but do not address the critical issue with the second type of operation. They state:
- The final list `array` after all operations.
- The `result` list containing elements from `array` selected according to the indices specified by `queries`.

However, they do not mention that the second type of operation is incorrectly implemented, leading to incorrect array construction.

#### Example Case:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 1
1 1
2 3
1 2
1
```
- After the first operation, the array is `[1]`.
- After the second operation, it should be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (3 copies of `[1]`), but the current implementation makes it `[1, 1]`.
- After the third operation, the array becomes `[1, 1, 2]`.
- The query asks for the 1st element, which should be `1`, but the current implementation outputs `2`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the primary issue with the implementation of the second type of operation. The provided code does not correctly handle the second type of operation, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
