Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` (either 1 or 2) and `x` (where `x` is between 1 and `n` if `b` is 1, and `x` is at least 1 if `b` is 2); and `queries`, which is a list of `q` positive integers representing the queries. The function processes the operations and then returns a list of results corresponding to each query.**
