To determine the output of the given `print(*result)` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Inputs and Initial State:**
   - `n`: A positive integer read from the input, representing the number of operations.
   - `q`: A positive integer read from the input, representing the number of queries.
   - `operations`: A list of `n` operations, where each operation is a list containing two integers `b` (either 1 or 2) and `x` (with `x` constrained by the value of `b`).
   - `queries`: A list of `q` integers read from the input.
   - `t`: Must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, it's mentioned in the precondition).
   - `result`: The value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is not provided in the code snippet, but it processes the `operations` and `queries` to produce a result.
   - The exact implementation and logic of `func_1` are not known, so we can't determine the exact numerical values in `result` without it.
   - However, we can describe `result` based on the precondition.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*result)` statement will print all elements of the `result` list separated by spaces.

Given that we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we can only describe `result` in terms of what it represents based on the provided information.

**Output Description:**
The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the list `result` returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. Since the exact values of `n`, `operations`, and `queries` are not provided, and the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact numerical values in `result`. However, we can describe `result` as the output of the function `func_1` given the inputs.

Output: **result (where result is the output of the function func_1(n, operations, queries))**
