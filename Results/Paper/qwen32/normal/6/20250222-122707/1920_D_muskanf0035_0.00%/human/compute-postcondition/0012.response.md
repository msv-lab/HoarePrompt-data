To determine the output of the `print(*result)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables and the function `func_1`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is a positive integer read from the input.
- `q` is a positive integer read from the input.
- `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input.
- `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `t` is `t - 1` (though `t` is not used in the given code snippet, it's mentioned).
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

### Analysis:
1. **`n` and `q`**: These are integers read from the input. They denote the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively.
2. **`operations`**: This is a list of `n` operations. The exact nature of these operations is not specified, but they are used as an argument to `func_1`.
3. **`queries`**: This is a list of integers read from the input. The exact nature of these queries is not specified, but they are also used as an argument to `func_1`.
4. **`t`**: This variable is mentioned but not used in the given code snippet. It is described as `t - 1`, but since it's not used in the print statement, we can ignore it.
5. **`result`**: This is the output of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The exact nature of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.

### The Print Statement:
The statement `print(*result)` will print the elements of `result` separated by spaces. The exact values printed will depend on what `func_1` returns.

### Conclusion:
Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `result`. However, we can describe the output in terms of what `func_1` returns.

Output: **the elements of the list `result` (where `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`) separated by spaces**.
