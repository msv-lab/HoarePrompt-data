Output State: **The program returns `result`, which is a list of elements from `array` selected according to the indices specified by `queries`, with the indices adjusted to wrap around `array` if necessary.**

In simple terms, each element in `result` corresponds to an element in `array` picked using the index `(k - 1) % len(array)`, where `k` is each element from `queries`.
