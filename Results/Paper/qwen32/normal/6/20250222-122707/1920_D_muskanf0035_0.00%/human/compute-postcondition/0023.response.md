To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand that the loop processes each element in the `queries` list and appends the corresponding element from `array` to `result` based on the formula `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. This means that for each `k` in `queries`, an element is selected from `array` and added to `result`.

Given the loop:
```python
for k in queries:
    result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
```

The loop will iterate as many times as there are elements in `queries`. After each iteration, `result` will have one more element, which is the element from `array` indexed by `(k - 1) % len(array)`.

**Output State:**
- `result` will contain as many elements as there are in `queries`.
- Each element in `result` corresponds to an element in `array` selected by the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` where `k` is each element from `queries`.

In simple terms, after all iterations, `result` will be a list of elements from `array` selected according to the indices specified by `queries`, with the indices adjusted to wrap around `array` if necessary.

Output State: **`result` contains elements from `array` selected by the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`.**
