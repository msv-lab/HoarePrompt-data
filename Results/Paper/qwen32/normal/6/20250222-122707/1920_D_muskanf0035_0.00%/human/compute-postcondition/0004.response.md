The code snippet provided updates the `queries` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `operations`, and `t`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list containing two integers `b` (1 or 2) and `x` (with `x` constrained by the value of `b`), `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0.**
