Output State: **`n` is the first positive integer read from the input, `q` is the second positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.**

Explanation: The code snippet provided reads `n` operations from the input and stores them in the `operations` list. The value of `n`, `q`, `queries`, `t`, and `result` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. The `operations` list is updated to contain `n` operations read from the input.
