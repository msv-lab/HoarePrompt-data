### Reasoning:

The problem involves processing a series of operations to build an array and then answering queries about the elements in the array. The operations are of two types: appending a single integer to the array or appending multiple copies of the current array to itself. The queries ask for the element at a specific position in the final array.

Let's break down the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: 
     - `n`: Number of operations.
     - `operations`: List of operations where each operation is a tuple `(op_type, value)`.
     - `queries`: List of queries where each query is an integer `k`.
   - **Process**:
     - Initializes an empty list `array`.
     - Iterates through the operations:
       - If the operation type is `1`, it appends `value` to `array`.
       - If the operation type is `2`, it appends `value` copies of `array` to itself. However, the provided code does not correctly handle the second operation. Instead of appending `value` copies of `array`, it appends `array` to itself once. This is incorrect because it does not account for the `value` parameter.
     - For each query `k`, it appends the element at position `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the `result` list.
   - **Output**: Returns the `result` list which contains the answers to the queries.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - **Process**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case:
       - Reads `n` and `q`.
       - Reads `n` operations.
       - Reads `q` queries.
       - Calls `func_1` with the read parameters and prints the result.
   - **Output**: Prints the answers for each query in each test case.

### Issues in the Code:

- **Incorrect Handling of Operation Type 2**: The code for operation type `2` is incorrect. It appends `array` to itself once instead of appending `value` copies of `array` to itself. This results in the array not being built as intended, leading to incorrect answers for the queries.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified in the handling of operation type `2`, the program is not correct. The logic for appending multiple copies of the array is flawed, and thus the final array constructed by the program will not match the intended array after all operations.

**Correctness: False**
