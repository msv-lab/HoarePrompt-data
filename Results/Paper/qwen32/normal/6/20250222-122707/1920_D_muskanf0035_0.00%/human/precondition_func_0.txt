n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n if b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 if b=2), and queries is a list of integers where each integer k satisfies 1 ≤ k ≤ min(10^18, c) with c being the size of the array after all operations.
