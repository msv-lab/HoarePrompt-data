### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code provided, and the annotations.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Operations:**
   - **Type 1:** Append an integer `x` to the end of the array.
   - **Type 2:** Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.

2. **Queries:**
   - For each query `k`, determine the `k`-th element of the final array, where elements are 1-indexed.

#### Key Points:
- The array can grow exponentially due to Type 2 operations, making it impractical to store the entire array explicitly.
- The problem requires handling up to `10^5` operations and queries across multiple test cases, which implies that the solution must be efficient.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:

##### Function `func_1`:
- **Appending Values:**
  - When `op_type == 1`, the program correctly appends `value` to the array.
- **Extending the Array:**
  - When `op_type == 2`, the program attempts to extend the array by appending `x` copies of itself using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. This is incorrect because it only appends the array once, not `x` times. The correct approach would be to extend the array `x-1` times since the array is already present once.
- **Query Handling:**
  - The program calculates the `k`-th element using `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This works correctly if the array is built correctly, but due to the incorrect handling of Type 2 operations, the array size and content are incorrect.

##### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Parsing:**
  - Correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of operations and queries, the operations themselves, and the queries.
- **Result Calculation:**
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after key operations.
- The annotations correctly state that the final list `array` after all operations have been processed should contain the correct sequence of elements.
- The annotations correctly state that the `result` list will contain elements from `array` selected according to the indices specified by `queries`, with the indices adjusted to wrap around `array` if necessary.

#### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the improper handling of Type 2 operations. When `op_type == 2`, the program should append `x` copies of the array, but it only appends once. This results in an incorrect array size and content, leading to incorrect query results.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle Type 2 operations correctly, leading to incorrect results.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
