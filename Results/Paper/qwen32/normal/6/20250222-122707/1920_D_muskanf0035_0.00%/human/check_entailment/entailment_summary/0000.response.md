### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided functions and understand whether they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function takes the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries. It processes the operations to build the array `array` and then answers the queries based on the final array.

- **Operation Type 1**: It appends the integer `value` to the end of the array.
- **Operation Type 2**: It appends `value` copies of the current array to the end of the array. However, the implementation provided in `func_1` is incorrect. Instead of appending `value` copies of the array, it appends the array to itself once (`array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`), which is equivalent to doubling the array. This will not produce the correct result if `value` is greater than 1.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results for each query.

### Correctness Analysis:
The main issue lies in the implementation of `func_1` when handling operation type 2. The problem statement requires appending `x` copies of the array to the end of the array, but the current implementation only appends the array to itself once, effectively doubling it. This discrepancy means that the function does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem.

For example, if the operation is `2 3`, the array should be appended to itself 3 times, not just once. The correct implementation should involve appending the array to itself `x-1` additional times.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect handling of operation type 2 in `func_1`, the overall program does not meet the problem description correctly.

**Correctness: False**
