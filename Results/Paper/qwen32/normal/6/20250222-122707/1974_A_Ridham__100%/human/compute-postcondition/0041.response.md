The code provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state includes other variables (`n`, `t`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`) which are not affected by this code snippet. The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells` and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_space // 15 + 1`**

In simpler terms: The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided in the input, while all other variables retain their initial definitions and values.
