### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program logic to see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 applications, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is the total space occupied by 1x1 applications, which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` is the total space occupied by 2x2 applications, which is `4 * y` because each 2x2 application occupies 4 cells.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Applications**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 applications (`screen_require_for_y`). If `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2. If `y` is odd, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1 (since each screen can hold 2 of the 2x2 applications).
   - This is correct because each screen can hold a maximum of 2 of the 2x2 applications.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` is the number of cells left on the screens used for 2x2 applications after placing all 2x2 applications.
   - This is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` because each screen has 15 cells, and `space_y` cells are occupied by 2x2 applications.

5. **Handling 1x1 Applications**:
   - If `space_x` (the space required for 1x1 applications) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, all 1x1 applications can fit on the screens used for 2x2 applications.
   - If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, the program calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 applications.
   - The number of additional screens is calculated by dividing the remaining space (`space_x - remaining_cells`) by 15 (the total cells in a screen) and rounding up if necessary.

6. **Output**:
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the placement of 2x2 applications first, then calculates the remaining space, and finally determines the number of additional screens required for 1x1 applications. It also correctly handles edge cases such as when there are no applications of either type.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
