The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` was decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `n` by 1 to start the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is decremented by 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells` and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`**
