The code snippet `result.append(screen_require_for_y)` appends the value of `screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list. This means that the `result` list will now contain an additional element, which is the value of `screen_require_for_y`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells` and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

In natural language: The `result` list now includes an additional element, which is the value of `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
