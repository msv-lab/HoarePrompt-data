Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis

1. **Grid Size and Icon Placement:**
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which gives a total of 15 cells.
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell each.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each.

2. **Approach in the Code:**
   - For each test case, the code calculates the total number of cells required for 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - It then calculates how many screens are needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons first.
   - If there are remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Potential Issues to Check:
- **Overlapping Icons:** The code should ensure that icons do not overlap.
- **Correct Placement of 2x2 Icons:** The code should correctly handle the placement of 2x2 icons.
- **Correct Calculation of Remaining Cells:** The code should correctly calculate the number of remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
- **Edge Cases:** The code should handle edge cases such as when there are no icons or when there are only 1x1 or only 2x2 icons.

### Code Review

Let's review the code to see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Checking Edge Cases and Specific Scenarios

1. **No Icons (x=0, y=0):**
   - The code correctly returns 0 screens.

2. **Only 1x1 Icons:**
   - For `x=15, y=0`, the code correctly returns 1 screen.
   - For `x=30, y=0`, the code correctly returns 2 screens.

3. **Only 2x2 Icons:**
   - For `x=0, y=1`, the code correctly returns 1 screen.
   - For `x=0, y=4`, the code correctly returns 2 screens.

4. **Mixed Icons:**
   - For `x=7, y=2`, the code correctly returns 1 screen.
   - For `x=12, y=4`, the code correctly returns 2 screens.
   - For `x=8, y=2`, the code correctly returns 2 screens.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code and checking various scenarios, it seems that the code correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for all given test cases and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**

The code handles all potential cases correctly and ensures that the icons are placed without overlapping, while also calculating the required number of screens accurately.
