The code snippet provided is `space_y = y * 4`. This line updates the value of `space_y` to be four times the value of `y`.

Given the Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is decremented by 1.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`.
- `result` is a list.
- `space_x` is equal to `x`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`.
- If `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number, and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.
- `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is the number of additional screens required based on the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`), rounded up to the nearest integer.

The value of `space_y` is recalculated as `y * 4`, which is consistent with its initial definition. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is decremented by 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`. If `y` is an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is an odd number, and `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is the number of additional screens required based on the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`), rounded up to the nearest integer.**
