### Reasoning

The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, where each screen is a 5x3 grid (15 cells).

#### Key Points:
1. **Space Calculation**:
   - Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons is `4 * y`.
   - The total number of cells occupied by 1x1 icons is `x`.

2. **Screen Allocation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - Each screen can accommodate at most 4 2x2 icons (16 cells, but only 15 are available).
   - If `y` is even, the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is `y // 2 + 1`.

3. **Remaining Cells**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on the screens allocated to 2x2 icons are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - If the remaining cells can accommodate all 1x1 icons, no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, the number of additional screens required for the 1x1 icons is calculated based on the remaining space.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
- It calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
- It then determines if the remaining cells are sufficient for the 1x1 icons.
- If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

The program logic appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. The program handles the edge cases (e.g., when `x` or `y` is zero) appropriately.

### Conclusion
Given the provided examples and the logic of the program, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
