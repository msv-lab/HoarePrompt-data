The code snippet `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` updates the value of `extra_screen` by performing integer division of `extra_space` by 15. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15`.**
