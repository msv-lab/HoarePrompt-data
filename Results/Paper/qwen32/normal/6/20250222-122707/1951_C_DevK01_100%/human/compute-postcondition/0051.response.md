Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N` - 1; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `L[1]` and `k`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element that was in `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has been updated is `cost`, which is now equal to `mu * w`. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
