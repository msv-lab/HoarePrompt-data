The code snippet provided updates the `cost` variable by adding a calculated value to it. Let's break down the change:

The new value added to `cost` is:
\[ m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu \]

Given the initial state:
- `cost` was initially `mu * w`.
- `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` with the last element removed.
- `w` is the last element that was in `N`.
- `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `L[1]` and `k`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `n` is `q - 1`.
- `t` is `t - 1`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `L` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input.

After the execution of the code snippet, the new value of `cost` is:
\[ \text{new\_cost} = \text{initial\_cost} + m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu \]
\[ \text{new\_cost} = (k - (n - 1) \times m) \times w + m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times (k - (n - 1) \times m) \]

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `L`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is `q - 1`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `L[1]` and `k`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element that was in `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `(k - (n - 1) * m) * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * (k - (n - 1) * m)`**.
