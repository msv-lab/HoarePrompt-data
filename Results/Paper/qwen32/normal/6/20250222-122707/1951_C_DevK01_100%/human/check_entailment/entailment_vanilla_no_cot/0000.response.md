Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the main issues:

1. The program does not account for the price increase correctly. The price of tickets increases by the number of tickets bought on the current day for all subsequent days, but the program does not update the prices accordingly after each purchase.

2. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The program attempts to sort the prices and then buy tickets in a way that minimizes the cost, but it fails to consider the dynamic nature of the price increases.

3. The program does not handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought (k) is not a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (m) correctly. The logic for handling the remaining tickets after buying full batches of m tickets is incorrect.

4. The program does not consider the possibility of buying tickets over multiple days in a way that minimizes the total cost, taking into account the price increases.

To solve the problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy approach with a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day (considering the price increases) would be more appropriate.
