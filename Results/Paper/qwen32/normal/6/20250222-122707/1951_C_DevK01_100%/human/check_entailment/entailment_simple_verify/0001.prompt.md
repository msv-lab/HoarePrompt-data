You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, where the price of tickets can increase based on the number of tickets bought on previous days. The constraints are:
- We can buy at most `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of prices `a`.
3. Sorting the prices in ascending order.
4. Calculating the number of days `q` needed to buy `k` tickets if we buy up to `m` tickets per day.
5. If `n * m` (total tickets bought if we buy `m` tickets every day) equals `k`, it calculates the cost based on the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
6. Otherwise, it calculates the cost by considering the last day separately and adjusting the cost accordingly.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The program assumes that the optimal strategy is to buy tickets on the cheapest days first, which is not necessarily true. The cost increase mechanism due to buying tickets on a day affects subsequent days, and the program does not account for this correctly.
   - The formula used for cost calculation is incorrect. It does not correctly account for the incremental increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets bought on the last day is less than `m`. It incorrectly calculates the cost by adding `n * m * mu` which is not the correct formula.

3. **Overall Approach**:
   - A greedy approach of always buying tickets on the cheapest available day does not guarantee the minimum cost due to the price increase mechanism.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not account for the price increase mechanism correctly and uses an incorrect formula for calculating the cost.
