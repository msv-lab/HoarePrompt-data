The code snippet `m = min(m, k)` updates the value of `m` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `k`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first element of `L`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
