The code snippet calculates the value of `cost` using the formula `mu * w`. Given the initial state, the values of `mu` and `w` are already defined.

- `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `w` is the last element of the list `N`, which contains the first `q-1` elements of the sorted list `M` after removing the last element.

After executing the code, the value of `cost` is determined, and no other variables are changed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is `q`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element; `w` is the last element of the original `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**
