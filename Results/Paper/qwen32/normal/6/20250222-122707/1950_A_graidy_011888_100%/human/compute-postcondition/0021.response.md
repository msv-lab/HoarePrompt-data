The `print('STAIR')` statement will output the string 'STAIR' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i`. These variables are mentioned in the initial state but do not affect the execution of the `print` statement, which is hardcoded to output 'STAIR'.

Output: **STAIR**
