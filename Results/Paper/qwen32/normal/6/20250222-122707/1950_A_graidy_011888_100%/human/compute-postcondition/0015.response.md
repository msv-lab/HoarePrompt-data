Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is described:
  - If `a < b < c`, then the relationship `a < b < c` holds true.
  - If `a < b` and `b > c`, then `a < b` and `b > c` holds true.
  - Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds true.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and must be less than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` do not influence the output of this particular print statement because the string `'PEAK'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
