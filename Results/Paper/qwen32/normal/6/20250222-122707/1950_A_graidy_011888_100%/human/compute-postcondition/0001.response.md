To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means that the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `n`.

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as they are since they do not impact the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `n` must be greater than 0**
