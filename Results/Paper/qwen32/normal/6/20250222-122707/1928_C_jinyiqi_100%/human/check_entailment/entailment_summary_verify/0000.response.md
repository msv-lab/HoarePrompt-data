### Reasoning:

1. **Undefined Function**: The original code uses `func_1` but does not define it, leading to a `NameError`. This is a critical issue that prevents the code from running correctly.

2. **Logic for Determining Valid `k`**: The logic in the original code for determining valid `k` values is flawed. The program attempts to determine valid `k` values using conditions that do not align with the problem description. The problem requires checking if the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described sequence, which involves iterating through potential `k` values and verifying the position within each period.

3. **Corrected Version**: The corrected version provided in the original assessment iterates through all possible `k` values from 2 to `n` and checks whether the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described sequence. This logic aligns with the problem description and ensures that all potential cases are handled correctly.

Given the issues with the original code and the correctness of the provided corrected version, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
