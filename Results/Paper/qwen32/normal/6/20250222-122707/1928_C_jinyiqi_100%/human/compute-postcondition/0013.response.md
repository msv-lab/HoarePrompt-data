The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `output2`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is already defined as `i + 1` with the precondition that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`. The variable `output1` contains the value of `i` and is not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x)`, `output1` contains the value of `i`, `output2` contains the previous values plus `int(x / i)`**.
