The code snippet `s = input()` reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means that `s` will hold the string value provided as input after this line is executed. The value of `n` is not affected by this line of code, as it is assumed to be already set before this input operation.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The following line contains the string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. The total number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 1000. `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string.**
