Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string and uses that to determine the output, but it does not perform the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

The program's logic is based on a misunderstanding of the problem. It seems to assume that the optimal way to minimize the penalty is to calculate `n - 2 * neg` or just `n` if all characters are '-', which is not correct. The optimal splitting strategy involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach to minimize the total penalty by carefully choosing how to split the array.

For example, in the third test case of the problem, the string is `+-+-+-`. The program would output `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which is correct for this specific test case, but this is not a general solution. The correct approach should consider all possible splits and calculate the penalties to find the minimum possible penalty.

Given the problem description, the program needs to implement an algorithm that considers the penalties of different splits and finds the optimal one, which is not what the current program does.

Correctness: **False**
