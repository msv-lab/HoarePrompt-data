The only variable in the loop head is `i` from the string `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next character in the string.

Given that `i` is the next character after the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be the subsequent character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`. If `i` is '-', `neg` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0.**

To be more precise, if `i` was at position `k` in the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be at position `k+1`. However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we just need to state that `i` is the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `i`. If `i` is '-', `neg` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0.**
