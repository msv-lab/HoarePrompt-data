Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `i`. If `i` is '-', `neg` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `neg` is 1.**

Natural language: The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. If `i` was previously '-', `neg` was either 1 or 2, and now it is either 2 or 3. If `i` was not '-', `neg` was 0 and is now 1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
