The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to update `i` to the next character in the string `s`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'.
- `neg` is 1 if the current character `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current character being processed. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `neg` is 1 if `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 0**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can't specify exactly which character `i` will be in the next iteration. However, we can describe the state in terms of the next character in the sequence.

Let's assume `i` was at position `k` in the string `s` during the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be at position `k+1`.

For the sake of the task, we can describe the state as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `i`, `neg` is 1 if the new `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 0**.
