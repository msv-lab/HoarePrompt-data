To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, and increments the variable `neg` by 1 every time it encounters a character '-'.

Given that `s` is a string of length `n`, the loop will execute exactly `n` times, once for each character in `s`. The final value of `neg` will be the total count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

Here's the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished:

Output State: **`neg` is the total number of '-' characters in the string `s`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `neg` will hold the count of how many '-' characters were present in the input string `s`.
