Postcondition: **`N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `cd` is the count of consecutive elements in `nums` starting from `nums[0]` where the difference is 1, and `i` is the index where the loop terminates. Additionally, `cd` is an even number.**
