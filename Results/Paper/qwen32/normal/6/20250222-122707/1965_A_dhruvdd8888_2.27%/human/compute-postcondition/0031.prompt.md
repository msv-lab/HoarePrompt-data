You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns None. The print statement outputs 'Alice' to the console.
    #State: `N` is assigned the value of the first input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set, and the length of `nums` is greater than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns None after printing 'Bob'
    #State: `N` is assigned the value of the first input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `cd` is the count of consecutive elements in `nums` starting from `nums[0]` where the difference is 1, and `i` is the index where the loop terminates.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns None after printing 'Bob'
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns Alice
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of stones in each pile. The function does not return a value (returns None). Instead, it prints 'Alice' to the console if a certain condition is met, otherwise, it prints 'Bob'. The specific conditions for printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' are not detailed in the provided information.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None. The print statement outputs 'Alice' to the console.

Case_2: The program returns None after printing 'Bob'

Case_3: The program returns None after printing 'Bob'

Case_4: The program returns Alice


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
