Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error. Specifically, the loop that calculates `values` and `sum_values` is only run up to `n`, which is the maximum value from the input test cases. This means that if a test case has a value of `n` that is smaller than the maximum `n` from the previous test cases, the program will not correctly compute the sum of digits for that `n` because the corresponding `values` and `sum_values` have not been updated for that particular `n`.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2
12
15
```
The program will correctly compute the sum of digits for `n=12` but will incorrectly compute it for `n=15` because it only computes up to the maximum `n` from the input test cases (which is 15 in this case), but it does not recompute `values` and `sum_values` for each individual test case.

The loop should be inside the test case processing loop to ensure that `values` and `sum_values` are computed correctly for each `n` in each test case. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        values = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        sum_values = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        total = 0
        for i in range(10):
            values[i] = i
            total += i
            sum_values[i] = total
        for i in range(10, n + 1):
            word = str(i)
            last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
            remainder = int(word[:-1])
            values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
            sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
            sum_values[i] = sum_total
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that `values` and `sum_values` are computed for each `n` in each test case, thus handling all potential cases correctly.
