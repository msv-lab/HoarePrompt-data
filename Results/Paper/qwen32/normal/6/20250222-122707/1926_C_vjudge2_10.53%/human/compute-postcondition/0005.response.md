The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a conventional variable name used when the loop variable is not actually used in the loop body) and `t`. Since `_` is not relevant to the condition of the loop, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has been decremented by 1 (since the loop runs `t` times). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing one element `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1 from the previous state so it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again**.

Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, if `t` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing one element `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0**.
