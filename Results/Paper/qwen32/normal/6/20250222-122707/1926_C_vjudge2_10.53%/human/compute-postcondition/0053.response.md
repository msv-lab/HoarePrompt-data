To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum_values[n])` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Must be at least 1 (but its exact value is not specified).
2. **`numbers`**: A list containing at least one element. The exact elements are not specified.
3. **`values`**: A list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. Elements from index 10 to `max(numbers)` are initialized to 0, except:
   - `values[10] = 1`
   - `values[11] = 2`
   - `values[12] = 3`
4. **`sum_values`**: A list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`. Elements from index 10 to `max(numbers)` are initialized to 0, except:
   - `sum_values[10] = 46`
   - `sum_values[11] = 48`
   - `sum_values[12] = 51`
5. **`total`**: Set to 45.
6. **`n`**: The next element in `numbers`.

### Analysis:
The `print(sum_values[n])` statement will print the element at index `n` in the `sum_values` list. Given the initial state, we know the values of `sum_values` for indices 0 through 12. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified, so we can only provide a description based on the possible values of `n`:

- If `n` is between 0 and 9, it will print the corresponding value from the first 10 elements of `sum_values`.
- If `n` is 10, it will print 46.
- If `n` is 11, it will print 48.
- If `n` is 12, it will print 51.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the output based on the possible values of `n`.

### Output:
Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is the next element in the numbers list and sum_values is defined as specified in the initial state)**
