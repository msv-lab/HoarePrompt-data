The code snippet `total += i` increments the value of `total` by the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `total` is 1. After the operation, `total` becomes 3. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with `values[1]` set to 1, `values[2]` set to 2, and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element set to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0 except `sum_values[1]` which is set to 1, `total` is 3, `i` is 2.**
