The code snippet `values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]` updates the value of `values` at index `i` by summing the values at indices `last` and `remainder`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 11
- `last` is 1
- `remainder` is 1
- `values` is a list where `values[1]` is 1 and `values[12]` is 3, with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and all other elements initialized to 0

The value at `values[1]` is 1 and the value at `values[1]` is also 1, so `values[11]` is updated to `1 + 1 = 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `values[11]` is 2, and `values[12]` is 3, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0, except `sum_values[i]` which is 69, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is the string "11", `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 69, `i` is 11.**
