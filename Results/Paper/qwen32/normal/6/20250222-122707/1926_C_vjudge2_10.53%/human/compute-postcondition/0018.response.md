The code snippet `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` to the element at index `i` in the `sum_values` list. Given the initial state, `total` is 0 and `i` is 0, so `sum_values[0]` is set to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element initialized to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element set to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**.
