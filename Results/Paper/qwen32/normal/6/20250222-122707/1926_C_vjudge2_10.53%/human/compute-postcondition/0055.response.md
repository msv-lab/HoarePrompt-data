To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum_values[n])` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **`t`**: Must be at least 1 (but its exact value is not relevant for this specific print statement).
2. **`numbers`**: A list containing at least one element. The exact elements are not specified, but we know there is at least one element, and we refer to the next element as `n`.
3. **`values`**: A list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. All other elements are initialized to 0 except:
   - `values[10]` which is 1,
   - `values[11]` which is 2,
   - `values[12]` which is 3.
4. **`sum_values`**: A list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`. All other elements are initialized to 0 except:
   - `sum_values[10]` which is 46,
   - `sum_values[11]` which is 48,
   - `sum_values[12]` which is 51.
5. **`total`**: Set to 45.
6. **`n`**: The next element in `numbers`.

### Focus on `sum_values[n]`:

The `print(sum_values[n])` statement will print the value at index `n` in the `sum_values` list.

From the description of `sum_values`, we know:
- `sum_values` is initialized with specific values for indices 0 through 12.
- For indices greater than 12, the values are 0 unless specified otherwise.

Since `n` is the next element in `numbers`, and `numbers` is a list with at least one element, `n` could be any integer. However, based on the given values in `sum_values`, the most precise we can be is to describe the value of `sum_values[n]` based on the known values:

- If `n` is between 0 and 9, `sum_values[n]` will be `n`.
- If `n` is 10, `sum_values[n]` will be 46.
- If `n` is 11, `sum_values[n]` will be 48.
- If `n` is 12, `sum_values[n]` will be 51.
- If `n` is greater than 12, `sum_values[n]` will be 0 (unless specified otherwise, which is not the case here).

### Conclusion:

Without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can describe the possible output based on the known values in `sum_values`.

Output: **sum_values[n] (where sum_values[n] is a value from the list sum_values based on the value of n)**

If we need to be more specific, we can say:

- If `n` is 0 through 9, the output is `n`.
- If `n` is 10, the output is 46.
- If `n` is 11, the output is 48.
- If `n` is 12, the output is 51.
- If `n` is greater than 12, the output is 0.

Given the information, the most precise description is:

Output: **sum_values[n] (where sum_values[n] is the value at index n in the sum_values list)**
