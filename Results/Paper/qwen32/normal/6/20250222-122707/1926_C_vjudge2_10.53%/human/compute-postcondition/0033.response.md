To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state:

The code snippet is:
```python
sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer
- `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and all other elements initialized to 0 except `values[12]` which is `3`
- `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0
- `total` is 45
- `n` must be at least 10
- `word` is the string representation of `i`
- `last` is the integer value of the last digit of `word`
- `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with the last digit removed

The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the code snippet. We can assume that `i` is a value that is within the bounds of the `values` and `sum_values` lists.

Let's consider the possible values of `i` based on the given lists:
- If `i` is between 0 and 9, `values[i]` will be `i` and `sum_values[i - 1]` will be the cumulative sum up to `i - 1`.
- If `i` is 12, `values[12]` is 3 and `sum_values[11]` is the cumulative sum up to 11.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can consider a specific value for `i` to illustrate the calculation. Let's assume `i` is 12 for this example.

- `values[12]` is 3
- `sum_values[11]` is 66 (sum of numbers from 0 to 11)

Thus, `sum_total` will be:
```python
sum_total = values[12] + sum_values[11] = 3 + 66 = 69
```

The output state will be:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and all other elements initialized to 0 except `values[12]` which is `3`, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is the string representation of `i`, `last` is the integer value of the last digit of `word`, `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with the last digit removed, `sum_total` is 69**.
