The code snippet `sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]` calculates the new value of `sum_total` by adding `values[i]` and `sum_values[i - 1]`. Given `i` is 11, `values[11]` is 2, and `sum_values[10]` is 45, the new value of `sum_total` is `2 + 45`, which equals 47.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `values[11]` is 2, and `values[12]` is 3, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0, except `sum_values[i]` which is 69, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is the string "11", `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 47, `i` is 11.**
