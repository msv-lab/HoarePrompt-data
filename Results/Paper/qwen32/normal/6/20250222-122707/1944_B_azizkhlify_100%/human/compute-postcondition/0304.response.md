The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `res`, and `n` is a non-negative integer.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 (since `i` is the loop variable and it gets incremented in each iteration of a `for` loop in Python). The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is the last element of `res` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer.**
