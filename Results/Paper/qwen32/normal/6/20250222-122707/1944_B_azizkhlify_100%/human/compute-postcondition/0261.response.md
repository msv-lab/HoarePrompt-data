The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these two variables.

Given the condition `for i in range(n):`, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The initial value of `i` is given as `n-1`, which is not suitable for the first iteration of the loop, as the loop will start with `i` as 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` to its initial value of 0 and ensure `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
