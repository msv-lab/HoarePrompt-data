### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to understand its logic and verify its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - Then it reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` are initialized to zero. These arrays will be used to count the occurrences of each integer in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented for each element `a[i]` in the first half of `a`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented for each element `a[i]` in the second half.

3. **Constructing Subsets `l` and `r`:**
   - The program first tries to construct the subset `l` by selecting pairs of identical numbers from the first half of `a` until it has selected `2k` elements.
   - If it hasn't selected `2k` elements yet, it then selects additional unique elements from the first half of `a` until it has selected `2k` elements in total.
   - The subset `r` is constructed similarly from the second half of `a`. The program ensures that the XOR of the elements in `l` equals the XOR of the elements in `r`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` as two separate lines for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Subset Selection:** The program correctly selects elements from the first and second halves of `a` to form subsets `l` and `r`. It ensures that each subset contains `2k` elements.
- **XOR Equality:** The program ensures that the XOR of the elements in `l` equals the XOR of the elements in `r` by first selecting pairs of identical numbers (which have an XOR of 0) and then balancing with unique elements if necessary.

### Verification:

- The program correctly handles the constraints and conditions provided in the problem statement.
- The execution summary confirms that the program processes the list of integers according to the rules and outputs the correct subsets for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
