The value of `re` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged based on the given initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `re` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `re` is incremented by 1**.
