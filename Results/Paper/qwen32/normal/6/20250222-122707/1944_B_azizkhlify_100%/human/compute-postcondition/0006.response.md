The code snippet provided only initializes an empty list `res`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`) are modified. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list.**
