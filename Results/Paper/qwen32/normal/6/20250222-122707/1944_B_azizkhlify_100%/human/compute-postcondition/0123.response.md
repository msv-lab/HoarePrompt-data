The loop head in the provided `for` loop is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. This means that the loop variable `i` starts at `n` and continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`, incrementing by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` according to the loop's behavior. Since `i` is currently `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

The value of `n` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same. The state of `r[a[n] - 1]` is not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`**
