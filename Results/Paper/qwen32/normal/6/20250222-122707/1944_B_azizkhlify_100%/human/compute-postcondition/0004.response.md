The code snippet `r = [0] * n` creates a new list `r` with `n` elements, all initialized to `0`. This does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `l`. The only change is the introduction of the new list `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros; `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**
