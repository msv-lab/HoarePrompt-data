Postcondition: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. `ul` and `ur` are equal if the loop or if statement was broken out of.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block has executed, considering both the if and else parts. It retains the conditions stated in the precondition and describes the changes made to the variables based on the condition evaluated in the if statement.
