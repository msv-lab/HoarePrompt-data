To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code itself.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1.
- However, there is no information about the list `a` or its contents.

Since `i` is 1, the code is attempting to print the element at index 1 of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Given that we do not have explicit information about the contents of the list `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output will be the element at index 1 of the list `a`, printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
