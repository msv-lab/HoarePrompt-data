Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `n` must be greater than 0.
  - `i` is `n + 1`.
  - The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is incremented by 1.

- For loop statement:
  ```python
  for i in range(n, 2 * n):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Objective:
Determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the stop value).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 2`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` is `n + 2` at the start of the next iteration, the condition `n + 2 < 2 * n` must hold true.
   - Simplifying the inequality: `n + 2 < 2 * n` → `2 < n` → `n > 2`.

5. **Adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 2`.
   - `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n + 2`**.
