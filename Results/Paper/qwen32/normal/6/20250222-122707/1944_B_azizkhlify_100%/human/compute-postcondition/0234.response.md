Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the input list, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `r` is updated such that `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` are incremented by 1, `re` is unchanged, `ul` and `ur` are unchanged, `i` is `2 * n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the variable `r` will have been updated such that for each index from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, the element at `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state or the state they were in after the first `n` iterations.
