Let's break down the provided initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n`.
2. `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2`, multiplied by `2`.
3. `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to `0` for each `i` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2`.
4. `k` is `2 * k - ul`.
5. `res` must contain at least `n+1` elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is going to print the value of `i` followed by a space (because `end=' '`).
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is `n`, the print statement will output `n` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **n **
