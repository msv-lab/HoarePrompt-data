The code provided is simply a `break` statement, which will terminate the nearest enclosing loop. This statement does not alter the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the last element of `res`, `n` is a non-negative integer, If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. Additionally, `ul` equals `ur`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
