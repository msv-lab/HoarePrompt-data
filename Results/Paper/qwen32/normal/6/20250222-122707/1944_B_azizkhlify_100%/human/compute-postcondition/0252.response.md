Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `a` is the input list.
3. `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, except if `l[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0. If `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0.
4. `r` is updated such that `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` are incremented by 1.
5. `re` is unchanged.
6. `ul` is increased by 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` is unchanged.
7. `ur` is unchanged.
8. `i` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

Given that `i` is set to 1 in the initial state, the print statement will output the element at index 1 of the list `a` twice.

### Output:
Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
