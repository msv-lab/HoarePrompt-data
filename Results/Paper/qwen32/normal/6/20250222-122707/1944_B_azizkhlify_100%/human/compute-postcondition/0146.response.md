The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `l` by setting the element at the index `a[i] - 1` to `0`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the element at index `a[2] - 1` in the list `l` is set to `0`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l[a[2] - 1]` is 0**.
