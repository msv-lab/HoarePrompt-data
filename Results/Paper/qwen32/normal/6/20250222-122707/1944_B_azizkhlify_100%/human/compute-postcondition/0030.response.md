The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
