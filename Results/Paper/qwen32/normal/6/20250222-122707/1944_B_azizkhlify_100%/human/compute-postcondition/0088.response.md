Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2. The current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
