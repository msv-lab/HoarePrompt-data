The `break` statement will exit the nearest enclosing loop, but it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `l`, `a`, `re`, or `res`. Given the initial state, `i` is already `i + 1` and the conditions and operations related to `re` and `res` are contingent on the loop iteration which is now terminated. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `a`, `re`, and `res` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` includes `a[i]`. The loop is exited.**
