Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective:** Monocarp wants to throw a party and have at least 2 friends attend.
2. **Rules:**
   - Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`.
   - For friend `i` to attend the party, both `i` and `p_i` must receive invitations.
   - All `p_i` are distinct and `p_i ≠ i`.
3. **Output:** Determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)
```

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of friends) and a list `v` of length `n` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend.

2. **Logic:**
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n+1` with zeros and then reads the best friend list, prepending a zero to make the list 1-indexed.
   - It then checks for each friend `i` if `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition checks if `i` and `p_i` are best friends of each other.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that inviting both friends is sufficient.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, implying that at least 3 invitations are needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case 1:** If there exists a pair of friends `i` and `p_i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`, sending invitations to both `i` and `p_i` will ensure that both attend. This is correct.
- **Case 2:** If no such pair exists, the program assumes that at least 3 invitations are needed. However, this is not always true. Consider a scenario where there are multiple disjoint pairs or a cycle of more than 2 friends.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
- Here, `v = [0, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
- Checking each friend:
  - For `i=1`, `v[v[1]] = v[2] = 3 ≠ 1`
  - For `i=2`, `v[v[2]] = v[3] = 4 ≠ 2`
  - For `i=3`, `v[v[3]] = v[4] = 1 ≠ 3`
  - For `i=4`, `v[v[4]] = v[1] = 2 ≠ 4`
- The program will print `3`, but in fact, Monocarp can invite friends `1` and `2`, and both will attend because `v[1] = 2` and `v[2] = 3` (but `3` does not need to attend).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it does not account for cases where multiple pairs or cycles of friends need to be considered.

**Correctness: False**
