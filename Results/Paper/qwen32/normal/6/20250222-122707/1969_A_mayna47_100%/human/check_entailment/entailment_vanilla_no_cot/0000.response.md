Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. The logic in `func_1` only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and immediately returns 2 if such a pair is found. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of invitations required in all scenarios.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program will output `3` because it does not find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. However, the correct answer is `3` is not minimal. Monocarp can invite friends `1`, `2`, and `3`, and friends `1` and `2` will come to the party, making the minimum number of invitations `3`. But the optimal solution is to invite `1`, `2`, and `4` or `1`, `3`, and `4` or `2`, `3`, and `5` which only requires `3` invitations but the program does not consider these cases.

Another example:
```
5
3 1 2 5 4
```
The program will output `2` because it finds the pair `(2, 1)` and `(4, 5)`. However, the correct answer is `2` but the program does not consider if there is a better solution with `2` invitations. For instance, inviting `1` and `3` is also a valid solution with `2` invitations.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all test cases as it does not always find the minimum number of invitations required.
