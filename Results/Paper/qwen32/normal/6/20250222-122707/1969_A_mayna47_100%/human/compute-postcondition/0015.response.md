Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the integer value from the input (where 2 <= `n` <= 50); `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input; `i` is 3. If `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`, the program does not return anything.**
