The value of `n` is updated to be the integer value of the input. The initial state specifies that `n` was an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. After the code executes, `n` takes on the specific value provided by the input, while `t` and `p` remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer value from the input (where 2 <= n <= 50); `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`.**
