The code snippet initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The initial states of `t` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer value from the input (where 2 <= n <= 50); `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
