Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
2. `n` is an integer read from the input, where 2 <= `n` <= 50.
3. `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`.
4. `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and the remaining `n` elements are integers read from the input.
5. `i` is set to 2.
6. `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(2)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `2`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
