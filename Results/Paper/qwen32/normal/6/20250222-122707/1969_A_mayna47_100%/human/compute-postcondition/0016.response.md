To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop progresses and what conditions need to be met for it to continue or terminate.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each `i`, it checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. If this condition is met, it prints `2` and returns, terminating the loop. If the condition is not met, the loop continues to the next iteration.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we know that for `i = 1`, `i = 2`, and `i = 3`, the condition `v[v[i]] == i` was not met.

Since the problem does not specify any additional conditions or changes in the list `v` within the loop, we can assume that the loop will continue checking each `i` from 1 to `n` until it either finds an `i` for which `v[v[i]] == i` or completes all iterations.

If the loop completes all iterations without finding any `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`, the program will not print `2` and will not return early. Instead, it will finish all iterations and the final state will simply be the state of the variables at the end of the loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations will be:

- `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` remains unchanged as the integer value from the input (where 2 <= `n` <= 50).
- `p` remains unchanged as a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`.
- `v` remains unchanged as a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes all iterations.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is the integer value from the input (where 2 <= n <= 50); p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i; v is a list of n + 1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining n elements are the integers read from the input; i is n + 1.**
