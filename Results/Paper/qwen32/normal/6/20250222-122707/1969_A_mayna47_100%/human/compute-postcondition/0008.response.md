The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000;
- `n` is the integer value from the input (where 2 <= `n` <= 50);
- `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`;
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input;
- `i` is 1;
- `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`

For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the integer value from the input (where 2 <= `n` <= 50); `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input; `i` is 2; `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`**
