To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('1', end=' ')
    print(i)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. After each iteration, `i` increments by 1. The loop will execute `n` times in total.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we observe:
- After 1 iteration, `i` is 2.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is 3.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is 4.

Following this pattern, after all `n` iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n + 1` and then terminates.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the loop's upper limit.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes all iterations.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `i` is n + 1**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1`, while `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial values.
