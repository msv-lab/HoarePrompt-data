The code provided is `n = int(input())`, which means that `n` will be assigned the value of an integer input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000. However, the code snippet only affects `n` and does not change `t` or any other variables not mentioned.

Since `n` is being reassigned, we need to reflect this in the output state. The value of `n` will be whatever integer is input by the user, but it will still be within the range of 2 to 1000 as per the problem constraints.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3 as input by the user.**
