The `print(' ')` statement in the given code snippet prints a single space character, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `i`.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is defined as `t - 1` (which must be greater than 0), but this does not affect the print statement.
2. The variable `n` is unchanged, and its value does not affect the print statement.
3. The variable `i` is defined as `n + 1`, but this also does not affect the print statement.
4. The `print(' ')` statement explicitly prints a single space character.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is a single space.

Output: ** ** (a single space)**
