The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1'` followed by a space. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function specifies that a space should be printed at the end of the output string instead of the default newline character.

The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The variable `t` is defined as `t - 1` (which must be greater than 0), but it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `n` is defined as being at least 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
3. The variable `i` is defined as 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

Since none of these variables are used in the `print` statement, the output will simply be the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
