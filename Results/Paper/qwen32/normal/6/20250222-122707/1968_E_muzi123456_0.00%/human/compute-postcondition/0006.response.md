To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to understand the context and the variables involved. According to the initial state provided, we have the following:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\).

However, the variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state at all. This means that the value of `i` is not defined based on the information given. Therefore, the code snippet provided will result in a `NameError` because the variable `i` is being referenced before it is assigned a value.

Since the variable `i` is not defined, the code will not execute successfully, and there will be an error instead of a valid output.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
