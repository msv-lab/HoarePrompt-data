The given initial state describes the values and conditions of the variables `t`, `n`, and `i`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not use any of these variables. Instead, it prints the string `'1'` followed by a space, and it does not add a newline at the end due to the `end=' '` argument.

Here's the breakdown of the code execution:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` as its argument.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that after printing `'1'`, the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'1 '`.

Output: **1 **
