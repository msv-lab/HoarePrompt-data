The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `r`, and `mid` remain unchanged. The precondition that `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `find` is an integer that exists in the array, and `array[mid]` is less than `find` still holds true.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `find` is an integer (1 â‰¤ `find` â‰¤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `array[mid]` is less than `find`.**
