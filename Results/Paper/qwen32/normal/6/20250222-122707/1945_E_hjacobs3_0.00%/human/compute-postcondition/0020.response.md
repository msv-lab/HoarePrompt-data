Postcondition: **`l` is the smallest index such that all elements before `l` are less than `find`, and `r` is the largest index such that all elements after `r` are greater than or equal to `find`. If `find` exists in the array, `l` will be equal to `r + 1` and point to the position just after the last element less than `find`. If `find` does not exist in the array, `l` will be equal to `r + 1` and point to the position where `find` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.**
