The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `l` and `r` are not explicitly provided, but we know how they are updated based on the condition `array[mid] >= find`:

1. If `array[mid] >= find`, then `r` is updated to `(n - 1) // 2 - 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
2. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `((l + r) // 2) + 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `l` is still less than or equal to `r`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `l` and `r` from the previous iteration, we can infer that for the loop to continue, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, we need to set the state such that this condition holds.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`. `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.**
