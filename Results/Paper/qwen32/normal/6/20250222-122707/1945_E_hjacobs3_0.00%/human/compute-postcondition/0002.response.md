To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `l <= r` is satisfied. The variables `l` and `r` are directly involved in the loop condition.

Given:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the length of `array`

The loop condition `l <= r` will be true as long as `0 <= n - 1`. This inequality holds true for any positive integer `n` (since `n` is the length of a non-empty list, `n` must be at least 1).

Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (as it is the length of a permutation of integers), `r` will always be at least 0, making the condition `l <= r` always true.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute its first iteration.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
