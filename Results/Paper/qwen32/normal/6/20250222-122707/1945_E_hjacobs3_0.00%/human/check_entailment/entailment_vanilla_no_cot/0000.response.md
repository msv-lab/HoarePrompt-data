Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The problem specifies a particular binary search algorithm that should be used, but the provided code does not match the described algorithm. Specifically, the loop condition should be `while l < r` and the update rules should be `r = mid` and `l = mid` accordingly.

2. **Handling the Result**: The program checks if `l` equals the index of `find` in the array, but the binary search described in the problem does not guarantee that `l` will be the index of `find` if it exists. The goal is to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, which may require more sophisticated handling.

3. **Swapping Elements**: The problem allows for up to two swaps to arrange the array such that the binary search will result in `p_l` being equal to `x`. The provided program does not attempt to perform these swaps, and it only checks if the current `l` position is correct, which is not sufficient.

4. **Output Format**: The output format specified in the problem requires printing the number of swaps followed by the swaps themselves. The provided program does not handle this correctly and instead prints the result of `func_1` directly, which is not the expected format.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement the binary search as described, and if the result is not correct, determine the necessary swaps to make `p_l` equal to `x`. This may involve strategic placement of `x` in the array to ensure that the binary search terminates with `p_l` being `x`.
