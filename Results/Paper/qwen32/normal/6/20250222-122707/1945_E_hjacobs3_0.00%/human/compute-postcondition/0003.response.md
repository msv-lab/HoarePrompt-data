The code calculates the middle index `mid` of the current range defined by `l` and `r` using integer division. Given the initial state, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `mid` is calculated as `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`**.
