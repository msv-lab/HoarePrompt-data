Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is 0 and `r` is `mid - 1`. If `array[mid]` is less than `find`, then `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is `n - 1`.**
