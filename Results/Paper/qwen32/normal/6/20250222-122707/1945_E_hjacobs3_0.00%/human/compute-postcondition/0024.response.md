The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print(0)` statement. This statement will print the integer `0` regardless of the initial state described. The initial state provides information about the variables `l` and `r` and their relationship to the `find` value in an array, but this information is not used in the provided print statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the indices `l` and `r` in the context of a sorted array and a value `find`.
2. The print statement `print(0)` is independent of these variables and simply outputs the integer `0`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **0**
