Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer existing in the array. The function returns a list containing two string elements: the first element is the string representation of `l + 1` (where `l` is the index of `find` in the array), and the second element is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one.**
