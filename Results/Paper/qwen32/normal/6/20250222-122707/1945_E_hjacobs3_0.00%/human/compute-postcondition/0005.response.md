The code snippet `r = mid - 1` modifies the value of `r` by setting it to `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.**
