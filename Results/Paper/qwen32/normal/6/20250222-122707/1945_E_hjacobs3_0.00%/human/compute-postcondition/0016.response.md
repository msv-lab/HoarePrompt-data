The code snippet `r = mid - 1` modifies the value of the variable `r` by setting it to `mid - 1`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `mid`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Given that `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, after executing the code, `r` will be decremented by 1. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, and `mid` remain the same, and `l` is still valid as part of the precondition.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `r` is `mid - 1`.**
