Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] >= find`, then `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.**
