The code snippet `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` by setting it to `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, the new value of `l` is now `((l + r) // 2) + 1`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is `((l + r) // 2) + 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`**.
