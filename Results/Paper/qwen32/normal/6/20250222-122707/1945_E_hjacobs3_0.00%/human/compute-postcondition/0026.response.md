Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation and an integer `find` that exists in the array. It returns a list containing two string elements: the first is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one, and the second is also the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one. The function prints `1` if the calculated index `l` does not match the index of `find` in the array, otherwise it prints `0`.**
