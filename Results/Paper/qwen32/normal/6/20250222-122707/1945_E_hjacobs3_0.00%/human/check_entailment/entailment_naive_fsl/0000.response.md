Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are a few issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The loop condition `while l <= r` should be `while l < r` as per the problem description. Additionally, the logic to adjust `l` and `r` is not correct. The problem specifies that if `p_m <= x`, then `l = m`, otherwise `r = m`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The program attempts to perform a swap if the binary search does not find the element at the correct position. However, it does not actually perform the swap operation on the array before running the binary search. It only prints the swap indices if a swap is needed, but does not modify the array accordingly.

3. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` returns a list of strings to be printed, but the problem requires the program to print the number of operations and the swap indices directly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where the element is already at the correct position after the binary search.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
2 4
1 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
3 4
```

The program incorrectly identifies only one swap is needed, but the problem requires up to two swaps to correctly position the element for binary search.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly implement the binary search, perform the necessary swaps on the array, and print the correct output format.
