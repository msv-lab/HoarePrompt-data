### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by performing binary search on a permutation array with at most two swaps allowed to ensure that the element `x` can be found correctly using binary search.

Let's analyze the provided code and the logic behind it:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number `x` to be found.
   - It then reads the permutation array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function performs a binary search on the array to find the position where `x` should be.
   - If the position `l` (calculated by binary search) is not equal to the actual index of `x` in the array, it means the array is not sorted in a way that binary search would find `x` at position `l`.
   - It then suggests a single swap to bring `x` to the correct position.

3. **Logic and Correctness:**
   - The binary search logic implemented in `func_1` is incorrect for the problem's requirement. The problem specifies that the array must be rearranged such that after binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. This means the element at the index `l` after binary search should be `x`.
   - The provided code does not guarantee that after performing the suggested swap, the binary search will correctly place `x` at `p_l`.
   - The function does not consider the possibility of using two swaps, which is allowed by the problem statement.
   - The provided code does not handle the case where `x` is already in the correct position after binary search.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem's requirements. It does not ensure that after at most two swaps, binary search will correctly find `x` at `p_l`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
