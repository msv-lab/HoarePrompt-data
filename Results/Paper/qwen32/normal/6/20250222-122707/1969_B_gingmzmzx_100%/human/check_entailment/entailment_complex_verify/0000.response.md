### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly computes the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's).
- **Operation**: Cyclic shift a substring of length `r - l + 1` with a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- **Goal**: Find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted order.

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided does not directly simulate the cyclic shifts or calculate the cost of those shifts. Instead, it uses a different approach based on counting '0's and '1's. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Counting Zeros and Ones**:
   ```python
   zeroes = s.count(0)
   cnt = [0, 0]
   ans = 0
   for c in s:
       cnt[c] += 1
       if c == 0:
           ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
       else:
           ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
   ```

   - `zeroes` counts the total number of '0's in the string.
   - `cnt` keeps a running count of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - `ans` accumulates the cost based on the following logic:
     - If the current character is '0' and there have been '1's before it (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans`.
     - If the current character is '1', it adds the number of remaining '0's (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

2. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

   The accumulated `ans` is printed as the result for each test case.

#### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Logic Explanation**:
  - For each '0' encountered after at least one '1', the program adds 1 to `ans`. This accounts for the cost of moving the '0' past the '1's it has encountered.
  - For each '1' encountered, the program adds the number of remaining '0's (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This accounts for the cost of moving all remaining '0's past this '1'.

- **Example Test Case**:
  - **Input**: `10`
  - **Expected Output**: `2` (since we need to perform a cyclic shift on the whole string which has a cost of 2).
  - **Program Output**:
    - `zeroes = 1`
    - `cnt = [0, 0]`
    - First character is '1': `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
    - Second character is '0': `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Therefore, `ans = 1`, which is incorrect.

- **Another Example**:
  - **Input**: `11000`
  - **Expected Output**: `9` (as explained in the problem statement).
  - **Program Output**:
    - `zeroes = 3`
    - `cnt = [0, 0]`
    - First character is '1': `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
    - Second character is '1': `cnt = [0, 2]`, `ans = 0`
    - Third character is '0': `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
    - Fourth character is '0': `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 2`
    - Fifth character is '0': `cnt = [3, 2]`, `ans = 2`
    - Therefore, `ans = 2`, which is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic used in the program does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**.
