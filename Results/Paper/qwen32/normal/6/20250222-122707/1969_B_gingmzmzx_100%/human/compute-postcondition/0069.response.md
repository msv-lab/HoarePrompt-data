The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` increments the variable `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element.
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 0.
- `cnt` is `[1, 2]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, `[2, 1]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, or `[2, 2]` if `c` was 0 or 1 and `cnt` was `[1, 1]`.
- `c` is the next element in the list `s`.

The only variable that changes is `ans` based on the condition `cnt[1] > 0`. Since the exact values of `cnt` are specified, we can determine the effect on `ans`:

- If `cnt` is `[1, 2]` or `[2, 2]`, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `cnt` is `[2, 1]` or `[0, 2]`, `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `cnt` is `[2, 0]`, `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, so `ans` remains unchanged.

Given the possible values of `cnt`, `cnt[1]` is always greater than 0, so `ans` will always be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 0; `cnt` is `[1, 2]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, `[2, 1]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, or `[2, 2]` if `c` was 0 or 1 and `cnt` was `[1, 1]`; `c` is the next element in the list `s`; `ans` is incremented by 1.**
