The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop. The loop will execute `n` times, and the state of `_` does not change within the loop. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string
- `n` is greater than 0
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`
- `cnt` is [zeroes, len(s) - zeroes]
- `ans` is the final accumulated score based on the loop rules

Since the loop head only involves `_`, and the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, the only state we need to adjust is `n` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [zeroes, len(s) - zeroes], `ans` is the final accumulated score based on the loop rules**
