The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is a list `[0, 0]`, and `c` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, we must assume `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the context of counting binary digits (0s and 1s).

Since `c` can only be 0 or 1, the value at `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1. This means if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` will be incremented, and if `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` will be incremented. 

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0] with one of its elements incremented by 1, `ans` is 0.**
