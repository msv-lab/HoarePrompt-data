The code snippet `cnt = [0, 0]` resets the value of `cnt` to `[0, 0]`, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is the final accumulated score based on the loop rules.**
