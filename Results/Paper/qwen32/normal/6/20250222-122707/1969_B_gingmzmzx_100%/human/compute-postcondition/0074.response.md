Output State: **The loop will have executed `n` times, and for each execution, it will have processed a binary string `s`. The variable `ans` will hold the accumulated score for the current binary string `s` after processing all its digits according to the rules specified in the loop. The variables `t` and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations:
- The loop will have processed `n` binary strings.
- For each binary string, it calculates a score (`ans`) based on the number of '0's that have at least one '1' before them and the contribution of each '1' to the total number of '0's that come after it.
- The variables `t` and `n` will retain their initial values as they are not altered within the loop.
- The final `ans` for the last processed string will be printed, and no further changes will occur to the state of `t` or `n`.
