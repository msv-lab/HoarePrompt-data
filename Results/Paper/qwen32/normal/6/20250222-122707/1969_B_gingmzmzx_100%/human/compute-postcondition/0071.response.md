Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[1, 2]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, `[2, 1]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, or `[2, 2]` if `c` was 0 or 1 and `cnt` was `[1, 1]`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]` to it.**
