Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `c` is the next element in `s` after the previously processed element. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is updated to be either [3, 0], [2, 1], [1, 2], or [0, 3], and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0. If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is updated to be either [3, 0] if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was [2, 0], [2, 1] if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was [2, 0], [1, 2] if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was [0, 2], [0, 3] if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was [0, 2], [2, 1] if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was [1, 1], or [1, 2] if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was [1, 1], and `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
