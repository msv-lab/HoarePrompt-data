The code snippet `cnt = [0, 0]` resets the `cnt` list to `[0, 0]`, overriding its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is the total count of pairs (0, 1) and the contribution of each 1 to the total number of 0s that come after it in the previous list `s`.**
