The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. Given that `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `cnt[1]` will be 1 in one case and 0 in the other. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is 1, and will not change if `cnt[1]` is 0. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, else `ans` remains unchanged.**
