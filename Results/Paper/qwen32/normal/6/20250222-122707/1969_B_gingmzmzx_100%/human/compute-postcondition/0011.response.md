The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string and must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**
