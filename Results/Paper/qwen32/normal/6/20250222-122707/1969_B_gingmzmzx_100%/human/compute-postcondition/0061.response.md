Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]` with one of its elements incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1] > 0` else 0. Otherwise, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
