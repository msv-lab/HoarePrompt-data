You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the significant bits of the original x + 1, mx is the maximum value of i encountered during the loop.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers with at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, `ansv` is a list of integers starting from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where len(subseq_lens) is the length of the subseq_lens list)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers with at least `mx + 1` elements, `mx` is the length of `ansv` minus 1, `ansv` is a list of integers starting from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[mx]`, `i` is `mx`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `X` such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The function returns the result for each test case based on the value of `X`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
