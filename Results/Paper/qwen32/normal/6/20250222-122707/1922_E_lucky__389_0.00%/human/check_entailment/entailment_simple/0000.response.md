### Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic involves decomposing `X - 1` into a sum of powers of 2, which corresponds to the lengths of increasing subsequences that can be formed from the array.

Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Decomposition of `X - 1`:**
   - The program tries to break down `X - 1` into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the binary representation of `X - 1`. Each bit set in the binary representation of `X - 1` corresponds to a distinct length of increasing subsequences that need to be formed.

2. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The array is constructed based on the lengths of the increasing subsequences determined from the decomposition. The array elements are chosen such that they can form the required subsequences.
   - The list `subseq_lens` stores the exponents of the powers of 2 that sum up to `X - 1`. The array `ansv` is then constructed using these exponents.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the length of the array and the array itself.
   - The length of the array is `len(ansv)`, which is derived from the number of significant bits in the binary representation of `X - 1`.
   - The array `ansv` is printed, which should correspond to an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Construction of `ansv`:**
   - The construction of `ansv` is flawed. The list `ansv` is supposed to represent the values of the array that can form the required increasing subsequences.
   - The current construction of `ansv` only includes the exponents from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element. This does not guarantee that the array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where `X - 1` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `X = 3` (which means `X - 1 = 2`), the binary representation is `10`, and the program should output an array like `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]` to form exactly 3 increasing subsequences (`[], [0], [1]`).

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct in terms of the length and the elements of the array, but the construction of the array itself is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly construct the array to ensure that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
