Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0 if `i` was initially 0, otherwise `mx` is max(`mx`, `i`), and `i` is 1**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
