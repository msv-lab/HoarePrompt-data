Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The array can have a length of at most 200.
- If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.
- If multiple arrays are possible, any of them is acceptable.

### Key Observations:
1. **Increasing Subsequences**: The problem revolves around generating increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be calculated based on how many elements can be chosen in different ways to form increasing subsequences.
2. **Binary Representation**: The program seems to leverage binary representation to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences. It tries to decompose `X-1` into a sum of powers of 2, which can help in constructing the array.

### Program Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `X`.
- **Adjustment**: It subtracts 1 from `X` to simplify the counting process.
- **Binary Decomposition**: It attempts to decompose `X-1` into a sum of powers of 2. This is done by finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X+1` and subtracting it from `X`, then repeating until `X` becomes 0.
- **Array Construction**: The program constructs an array based on the lengths of the subsequences derived from the binary decomposition. It starts with a sequence of increasing integers `[0, 1, ..., mx-1]` and appends additional elements based on the lengths found.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incomplete Array Construction**: The program constructs the array based on the lengths of the subsequences but doesn't ensure that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is very large or when `X` cannot be represented by the binary decomposition method used.
3. **Output Format**: The program prints the array elements in a single line without a newline at the end, which might not conform to the problem's output requirements.

### Example Analysis:
Let's analyze the example provided:
- For `X=2`, the program should output an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. The output `[0]` is incorrect because `[0]` has 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`, but the program doesn't handle this correctly.
- For `X=5`, the output `[0 1 0]` is incorrect because it does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
- For `X=13`, the output `[2 2 3 4 2]` is incorrect for the same reason.
- For `X=37`, the output `[-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1]` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to construct the array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences and does not handle edge cases properly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
