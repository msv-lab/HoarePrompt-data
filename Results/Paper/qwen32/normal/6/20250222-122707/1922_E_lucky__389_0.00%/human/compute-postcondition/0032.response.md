The code appends the value of `i` to the list `subseq_lens`. The values of `t`, `X`, `x`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is max(`mx`, `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`), and `i` is `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**
