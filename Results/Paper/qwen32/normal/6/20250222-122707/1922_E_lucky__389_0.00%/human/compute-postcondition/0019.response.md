Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is the input value minus 1 and the input value must be at least 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0 if `i` was initially 0, otherwise `mx` is max(`mx`, `i`), and `i` is floor(log2(x + 1)). If `i` is 0, no changes are made to `x` or `mx`; otherwise, `x` is decreased by 1 and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`.**
