Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is the input value minus 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i)
        x -= 2 ** i - 1
        mx = max(mx, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is the input value minus 1 and the input value must be at least 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0 if `i` was initially 0, otherwise `mx` is max(`mx`, `i`), and `i` is floor(log2(x + 1)). If `i` is 0, no changes are made to `x` or `mx`; otherwise, `x` is decreased by 1 and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is greater than 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`, and `i` is `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`. If `i` is 0, the current value of `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2^(i)`, and `mx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value of `i`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1. If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without modifying `subseq_lens` or `x`. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` contains the value of `i`, `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`, and `x` is updated to `X - (2^(i + 1))`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
