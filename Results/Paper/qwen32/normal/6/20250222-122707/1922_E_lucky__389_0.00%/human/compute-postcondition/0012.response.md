To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it terminates.

The loop increments `i` as long as `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 0. The loop will terminate when `2 ** (i + 1)` exceeds `x + 1`.

Given the outputs after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `i` is 1, meaning `2 ** 2 <= x + 1` (or `4 <= x + 1`), so `x` must be at least 3.
- After 2 iterations: `i` is 2, meaning `2 ** 3 <= x + 1` (or `8 <= x + 1`), so `x` must be at least 7.
- After 3 iterations: `i` is 3, meaning `2 ** 4 <= x + 1` (or `16 <= x + 1`), so `x` must be at least 15.

The loop will continue to increment `i` until `2 ** (i + 1)` is greater than `x + 1`. The final value of `i` will be such that `2 ** (i + 1) > x + 1` and `2 ** i <= x + 1`.

To find the final value of `i`, we need to find the largest integer `i` such that `2 ** (i + 1) > x + 1`. This is equivalent to finding the floor of the base-2 logarithm of `x + 1`.

The loop will terminate when `i` reaches the value where `2 ** (i + 1)` is just greater than `x + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be `floor(log2(x + 1))`.

Let's denote the final value of `i` as `final_i`. The final state of the loop will be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `X` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `subseq_lens` remains an empty list.
- `mx` remains 0.
- `i` will be `final_i`, which is the largest integer such that `2 ** (final_i + 1) > x + 1`.

In natural language, the final state of the loop is that `i` will be the largest integer such that `2` raised to the power of `i + 1` is greater than `x + 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, x is the input value minus 1 and the input value must be at least 2, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, i is floor(log2(x + 1)).**
