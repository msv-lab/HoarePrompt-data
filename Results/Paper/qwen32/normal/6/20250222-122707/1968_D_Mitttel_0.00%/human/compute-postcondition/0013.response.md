Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms, the value of `index` has been updated to `5 + n`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
