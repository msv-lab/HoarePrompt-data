You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array a, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each element in p and a is a positive integer.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the last iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the last iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the last iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * t`, `t` is 0, and `results` is a list containing `t` results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the last valid iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the last valid iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the last valid iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the last valid iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last valid iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last valid iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * T` where `T` is the total number of valid iterations, `t` is `T`, and `results` is a list containing `T` results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array `a`, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`, where each element in `p` and `a` is a positive integer. The function returns the final positions of Bodya and Sasha after `k` moves based on the permutation `p`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
