The only variable in the loop head is `remainder_steps`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `remainder_steps` is 0, which means the loop will not execute as it is. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `remainder_steps` to be greater than 0.

State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`; `score` is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each `current_pos` visited up to the `k`-th step plus `full_cycles * cycle_score`; `current_pos` is the position after `k` steps; `steps` is `k`; `visited` is a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was visited; `cycle_start` is not equal to -1; `cycle_length` is greater than 0; `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each `cycle_pos` in the cycle; `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps within the cycle; `remaining_steps` is greater than 0; `full_cycles` is 0; `remainder_steps` is greater than 0**
