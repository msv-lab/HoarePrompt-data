The provided code snippet updates the `current_pos` variable by setting it to `p[current_pos - 1]`. This means the new `current_pos` will be the value at the index `current_pos - 1` in the list `p`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `current_pos`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`; `score` is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each `current_pos` visited up to the `k`-th step plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`; `steps` is `k`; `visited` is a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was visited; `cycle_start` is not equal to -1; `cycle_length` is greater than 0; `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each `cycle_pos` in the cycle; `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps within the cycle; `remaining_steps` is greater than 0; `full_cycles` is 0; `remainder_steps` is `remainder_steps - 1`**.
