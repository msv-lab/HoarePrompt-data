n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, PB and PS are integers such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n, p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive) and represents a permutation, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
