The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a permutation `p` and an array `a` of length `n`, starting positions `PB` and `PS` for Bodya and Sasha, and a duration `k` for the game. It processes each test case using the `func_1` function and prints the result for each case, which likely represents the final positions or some outcome of Bodya and Sasha after `k` moves based on the permutation `p`.
