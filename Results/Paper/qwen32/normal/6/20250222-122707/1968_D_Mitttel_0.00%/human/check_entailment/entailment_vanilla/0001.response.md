Reasoning:  
The given program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles input reading, parsing, and output generation. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It then calls `func_1` with these values and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function determines the winner of the game by comparing the scores of Bodya and Sasha. It calls `calculate_score` for each player's starting position and compares the scores to determine the winner.

3. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position. It follows the rules of the game, adding the value of `a` at the current position to the score on each turn and moving to the position indicated by the permutation `p` unless the player decides to stay. The function handles cycles in the permutation by detecting when a position has been visited before and calculating the score for the remaining steps, taking into account the cycle length and score.

The logic in `calculate_score` is crucial for handling the large number of turns `k` efficiently. By detecting cycles, the function avoids unnecessary computations for repeated positions, which is important given the constraints (`k` can be up to \(10^9\)).

The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including input parsing, score calculation, and cycle detection. It also correctly outputs the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
