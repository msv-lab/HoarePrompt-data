The code snippet `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `index` is initially `5 + 2n + 4 + n`, which simplifies to `9 + 3n`. After executing `index += n`, the new value of `index` becomes `9 + 3n + n`, which simplifies to `9 + 4n`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `9 + 4n`, `t` is `t - 1` (and must be greater than 0), and `results` is a list containing `result`, where `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.
