Postcondition: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`. If `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, then `score` is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each `current_pos` visited up to the `k`-th step plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` for each of the `remainder_steps`; `current_pos` is the position after `remainder_steps` iterations; `steps` is `k`; `visited` is a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was visited; `cycle_length` is greater than 0; `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each `cycle_pos` in the cycle; `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps within the cycle; `remaining_steps` is 0; `full_cycles` is 0. If `cycle_start` is -1, then no changes are made to `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps`, and `full_cycles`.**
