The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` was decremented by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, before the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 more than its current value (which is greater than 0).

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `9 + 4n`, `t` is `t + 1` (and must be greater than 0), and `results` is a list containing the updated `result`, where `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`; `results` now includes the new `result` appended to it.**
