The code snippet provided calculates the remainder of `remaining_steps` divided by `cycle_length` and assigns this value to `remainder_steps`. Since `remaining_steps` is 0, the result of the operation `remaining_steps % cycle_length` will also be 0. 

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`; `score` is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each `current_pos` visited up to the `k`-th step; `current_pos` is the position after `k` steps; `steps` is `k`; `visited` is a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was visited; `cycle_start` is not equal to -1; `cycle_length` is greater than 0; `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each `cycle_pos` in the cycle; `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps within the cycle; `remaining_steps` is 0; `full_cycles` is 0; `remainder_steps` is 0.**
