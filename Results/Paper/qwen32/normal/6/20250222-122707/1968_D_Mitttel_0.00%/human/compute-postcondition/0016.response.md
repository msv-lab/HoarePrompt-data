To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`. Since the implementation details of `func_1` are not provided, we can only infer that it will take the input parameters and potentially return a value that gets assigned to `result`. The function could modify the input parameters, but typically functions do not modify immutable types (like integers) in Python unless they are part of a mutable structure (like a list). We will assume that `func_1` does not modify the input parameters and only returns a value.

Given this, the variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `index`, and `t` remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of the `result` variable, which holds the return value of `func_1`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.
