Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed for it to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Global Variable `k`**: The variable `k` is used in `calculate_score` but it is not defined within the function. It should be passed as a parameter to `calculate_score`.

2. **Indexing**: The program uses 1-based indexing for permutation `p` and array `a` in the problem statement, but the code is using 0-based indexing. This is correct in the code, but it should be ensured that all parts of the code consistently handle this.

3. **Cycle Detection**: The code correctly detects cycles and calculates scores based on cycles, but the issue with `k` needs to be resolved.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

The main change is passing `k` as an argument to `calculate_score` to ensure it is correctly used in the function. This should resolve the issues with the program.
