Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array a, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each element in p and a is a positive integer. `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `index`, which has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
