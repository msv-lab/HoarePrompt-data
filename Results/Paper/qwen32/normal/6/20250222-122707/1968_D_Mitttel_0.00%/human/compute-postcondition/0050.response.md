Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array `a`, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`, where each element in `p` and `a` is a positive integer. The function returns the final positions of Bodya and Sasha after `k` moves based on the permutation `p`.**
