The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `num`. Since the loop iterates in reverse from `len(num) - 1` to `0`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current index being processed, and since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to decrease `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

The state of `num` does not change as it is not modified in the loop head.

Given that `num` has at least one element, and `i` was the current index, the next value of `i` should be `i - 1`, provided that `i - 1` is still within the bounds of the list (i.e., `i - 1` should be greater than or equal to `0`).

Since the loop condition is `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element, `counter` is 1 if the current element `num[i]` is '0', otherwise `counter` remains 0 and `num[i]` is not equal to '0', `i` is `i - 1`**.

However, to be more specific, if `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate, so we need to ensure `i` is still within the valid range.

Let's assume `i` was not `0` at the end of the previous iteration. Then:

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element, `counter` is 1 if the current element `num[i]` is '0', otherwise `counter` remains 0 and `num[i]` is not equal to '0', `i` is `i - 1`**.

If `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate, so there would be no next iteration. But based on the provided information and the need to adjust for the next iteration, we assume `i` was not `0`.

So the final state is:

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element, `counter` is 1 if the current element `num[i]` is '0', otherwise `counter` remains 0 and `num[i]` is not equal to '0', `i` is `i - 1`**.
