To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given `for` loop statement:

```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the indices of the `num` list in reverse order. For the loop to execute, the `num` list must have at least one element. The loop variable `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1` and decrements until it reaches -1 (exclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a list of test cases.
- `counter` is 0.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`. Since `i` is determined by the length of `num`, we need to ensure that `num` has at least one element to allow the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

- `num` must be a list with at least one element.
- `counter` remains 0 (as it is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution).

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element, `counter` is 0**
