Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`; `i` is the last character in the string `s` to be processed. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`. If `newstr` is different from `s`, no additional changes occur to `s`, `a`, `i`, or `isreverse`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, no additional changes occur to `s`, `a`, `i`, or `isreverse`. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, no changes occur to `s`, `a`, or `i`.**
