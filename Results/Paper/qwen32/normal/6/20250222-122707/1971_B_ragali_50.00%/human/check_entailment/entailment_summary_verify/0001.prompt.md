You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of length at most 10. For each string, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' and then prints a modified version of the string based on specific conditions. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: 
    - The number of test cases, `t`.
    - For each test case, a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**:
    - For each test case, print "YES" and a rearranged string `r` that is not equal to `s` if such a rearrangement is possible.
    - Otherwise, print "NO".

3. **Constraints**:
    - The length of `s` is at most 10.
    - If multiple valid rearrangements exist, any one of them is acceptable.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
    - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters**:
    - The program converts the string `s` into a set `a` to find the unique characters.
    - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are multiple unique characters in the string, and a rearrangement is possible.

3. **Generating a New String**:
    - If multiple unique characters exist, the program attempts to generate a new string `newstr` by splitting `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
    - If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, it prints "YES" and `newstr`.
    - If `newstr` is equal to `s`, it checks if the reverse of `s` (`isreverse`) is not equal to `s`. If true, it prints "YES" and `isreverse`.
    - If both `newstr` and `isreverse` are equal to `s`, it falls back to a third attempt by rearranging the string in a different way (`s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]`). This third case is redundant since `newstr` and this rearrangement are the same.

4. **Handling Single Unique Character**:
    - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and no rearrangement is possible. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The third rearrangement attempt (`s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2]`) is redundant and does not provide a new string different from `s` or `newstr`.
- The program does not handle strings of length 1 or 2 correctly in all cases. For example, if `s` is "co", the program should output "YES" and "oc", which it does, but for "d", it correctly outputs "NO". However, for strings like "co", a more robust approach would be to simply swap the characters if the length is 2.

### Conclusion:
Despite the redundant rearrangement attempt, the program seems to handle the given examples correctly. However, it can be improved for clarity and robustness.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program works as expected for the given problem constraints and examples, although there is room for improvement in handling certain edge cases more efficiently.
