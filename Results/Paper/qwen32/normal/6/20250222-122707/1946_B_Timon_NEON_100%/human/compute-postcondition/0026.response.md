The code appends a new segment to `segments_variants` by combining `max_segment` with the list containing `i - 1`. The other variables (`arr`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, `i`) are not modified by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` contains `max_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty, `i` is incremented by 1.**
