Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`: if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` becomes `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`; if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` or remains unchanged, and `max_segment[0]` is adjusted accordingly. `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `max_sum` remains `-1`. `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty.**
