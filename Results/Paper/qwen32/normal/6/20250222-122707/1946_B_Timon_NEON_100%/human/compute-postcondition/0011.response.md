Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` is `-1`, and the current element `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `max_segment` has been updated to be equal to `new_segment`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
