Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is `-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`: if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` becomes `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`; if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` or remains unchanged, and `max_segment[0]` is adjusted accordingly. `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `max_sum` remains `-1`. `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. `max_segment` is updated such that `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. `segments_variants` is updated to contain either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` was greater than `new_segment[0]` before the update and `arr[i]` is less than 0, or `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `max_sum` remains `-1`. `new_segment` is updated to `[new_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was not empty; otherwise, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, or an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `new_segment` was `True` and `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment[0]` is reset to `[]`. Otherwise, if `new_segment` was `True`, `new_segment[0]` is also increased by `arr[i]`. If `new_segment` was `False` and `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. `segments_variants` includes a new segment which is either `max_segment` followed by `[i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` depending on the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
