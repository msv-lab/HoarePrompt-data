Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer; `max_segment` is updated such that `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`; `segments_variants` is updated to include a new segment which is `max_segment` followed by `[i - 1]`; `max_sum` remains `-1`; `new_segment` is updated accordingly; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the `segments_variants` list now includes a new segment, which is the current `max_segment` list appended with the value `i - 1`. All other variables retain their previous states, except for `i`, which has been incremented by 1.
