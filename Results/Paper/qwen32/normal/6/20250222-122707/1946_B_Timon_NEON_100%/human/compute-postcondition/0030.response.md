The code snippet provided resets `new_segment` to an empty list. This change affects the variable `new_segment` only, while the other variables (`arr`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i`) remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` contains `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `max_sum` remains `-1`. `new_segment` is now an empty list. `i` is incremented by 1.**
