Let's analyze the given Python code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation consists of selecting any contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(number)`**:
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is correctly implemented and useful for ensuring the final result is within the required range.

2. **Function `func_2(arr)`**:
   - This function seems to attempt to find the maximum sum subarray in `arr` and return it along with its indices.
   - The logic here is flawed. The function tries to maintain a list of segments and their sums, but it does not correctly handle the case where negative numbers are encountered or where the maximum segment should be chosen.
   - The function does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm or any other standard method for finding the maximum subarray sum.

3. **Function `func_3(number, quantity)`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum after `quantity` operations, but it is not implemented.

### Correctness

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum after `k` operations. Here are the main issues:
- `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum subarray sum.
- `func_3` is not implemented and does not perform any operations.

### Correct Implementation Idea

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Compute the maximum subarray sum of the initial array using Kadane's algorithm.
2. If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can keep adding this sum to the array `k` times.
3. If the maximum subarray sum is negative, adding it will not increase the sum, so we should not add it.
4. The final answer should be the sum of the original array plus the maximum subarray sum added `k` times, all modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided code, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
