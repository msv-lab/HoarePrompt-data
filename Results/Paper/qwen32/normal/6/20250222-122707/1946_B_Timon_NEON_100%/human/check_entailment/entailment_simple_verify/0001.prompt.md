You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
The task is to perform `k` operations on an array `a` of `n` integers. In each operation, you select a contiguous subarray of `a` and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be given modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Provided Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(number)`
This function simply returns the input number modulo `10^9 + 7`. It is correctly implemented for applying the modulo operation.

#### Function 2: `func_2(arr)`
This function is intended to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum (similar to Kadane's algorithm) and return the segment details (sum, start index, end index). However, there are a few issues with this implementation:
- The logic for maintaining `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. The `max_segment` should be reset correctly, and the logic for appending segments to `segments_variants` is incorrect.
- The function does not handle all edge cases, such as when all elements are negative, or when the array is empty.
- The function does not return the correct maximum segment sum.

#### Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`
This function is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. However, the function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It simply initializes `answer` to `0` and does not return anything.

### Correctness Analysis

Given the issues identified in `func_2` and the incomplete implementation of `func_3`, the program cannot correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. Here are the key points:
- `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum contiguous subarray sum.
- `func_3` does not perform any operations and does not compute the final answer.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Compute the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
2. If the maximum subarray sum is positive, repeatedly add it to the array `k` times.
3. If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best strategy is to add zeros (by selecting empty subarrays) to the array, which means the array sum remains the same as the original sum.

Given the current state of the provided program, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
