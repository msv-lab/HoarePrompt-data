The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` modifies the first element of the list `max_segment` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer; `max_segment[0]` is the original `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`; `new_segment[0]` is `[]`; `max_sum` remains `-1`; `i` is incremented by 1; `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]` or `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]` (condition unchanged); `segments_variants` includes a new segment which is `max_segment` followed by `[i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` (condition unchanged).**
