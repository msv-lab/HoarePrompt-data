Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is `-1`, and the current element `arr[i]` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]` and `segments_variants` contains one list `[0, 0, i - 1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` contains `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `new_segment` has been reset to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
