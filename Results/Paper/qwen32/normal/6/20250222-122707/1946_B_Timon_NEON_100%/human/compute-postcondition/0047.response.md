The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of `new_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. 

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is updated accordingly, and `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code snippet, the only variable that changes is `new_segment[0]`. It now holds its previous value plus `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`; `segments_variants` is updated accordingly; `max_sum` remains `-1`; `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`; `new_segment` is updated accordingly; `i` is incremented by 1.**
