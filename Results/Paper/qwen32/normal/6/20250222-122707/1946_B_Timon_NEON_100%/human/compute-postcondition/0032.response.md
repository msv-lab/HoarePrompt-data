The code snippet provided increments the first element of `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `max_segment`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]` with its first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty, `i` is incremented by 1.**
