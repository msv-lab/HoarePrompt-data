The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `i` for the next iteration of the loop to execute. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer.
- `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`.
- `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0.
- `max_sum` remains `-1`.
- `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty.
- `i` is the current index in the loop.

Since the loop iterates over the range of `len(arr)`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value such that the loop condition `i < len(arr)` was true. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty, `i` is incremented by 1**
