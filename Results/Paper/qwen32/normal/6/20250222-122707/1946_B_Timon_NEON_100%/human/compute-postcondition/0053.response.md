To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve based on the loop logic. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `arr`: List of integers.
   - `new_segment`: Empty list.
   - `max_segment`: `[0, 0]`.
   - `segments_variants`: Empty list.
   - `max_sum`: `-1`.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using the index `i`.
   - If `new_segment` is not empty:
     - If `arr[i]` is less than 0:
       - Compare `max_segment[0]` with `new_segment[0]`.
       - Append the larger segment (plus the index `i-1`) to `segments_variants`.
       - Update `max_segment` if `new_segment[0]` is larger.
       - Reset `new_segment` to an empty list and adjust `max_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]`.
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0:
       - Add `arr[i]` to both `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]`.
   - If `new_segment` is empty:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0:
       - Initialize `new_segment` with `[arr[i], i]`.
     - Add `arr[i]` to `max_segment[0]`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After all iterations, `max_segment` will contain the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray found so far and the starting index of this subarray.
   - `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered as potential maximum segments during the iterations.
   - `max_sum` remains `-1` as it is not updated within the loop.
   - `new_segment` will be empty if the last element in `arr` was negative, otherwise, it will contain the last segment being considered.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `arr = [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2]` and go through the loop:

- **Iteration 1 (i=0)**:
  - `arr[0] = 1` (>= 0), `new_segment` becomes `[1, 0]`, `max_segment` becomes `[1, 0]`.
- **Iteration 2 (i=1)**:
  - `arr[1] = -2` (< 0), `segments_variants` becomes `[[1, 0, 0]]`, `max_segment` remains `[1, 0]`, `new_segment` becomes `[]`.
- **Iteration 3 (i=2)**:
  - `arr[2] = 3` (>= 0), `new_segment` becomes `[3, 2]`, `max_segment` becomes `[4, 0]`.
- **Iteration 4 (i=3)**:
  - `arr[3] = 5` (>= 0), `new_segment` becomes `[8, 2]`, `max_segment` becomes `[9, 0]`.
- **Iteration 5 (i=4)**:
  - `arr[4] = -1` (< 0), `segments_variants` becomes `[[1, 0, 0], [8, 2, 3]]`, `max_segment` remains `[9, 0]`, `new_segment` becomes `[]`.
- **Iteration 6 (i=5)**:
  - `arr[5] = 2` (>= 0), `new_segment` becomes `[2, 5]`, `max_segment` becomes `[11, 0]`.

### Final State:
- `arr`: `[1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2]`
- `new_segment`: `[2, 5]`
- `max_segment`: `[11, 0]`
- `segments_variants`: `[[1, 0, 0], [8, 2, 3]]`
- `max_sum`: `-1`

Output State: **arr: [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2], new_segment: [2, 5], max_segment: [11, 0], segments_variants: [[1, 0, 0], [8, 2, 3]], max_sum: -1.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is 11 starting at index 0, and the segments considered as potential maximums are `[1, 0, 0]` and `[8, 2, 3]`. The `new_segment` at the end is `[2, 5]` because the last element in `arr` was positive. The `max_sum` remains `-1` as it was not updated during the loop.
