Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer; `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]` or `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]` (condition unchanged); `segments_variants` includes a new segment which is `max_segment` followed by `[i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` (condition unchanged); `new_segment` is `[]`; `max_sum` remains `-1`; `i` is incremented by 1 (condition unchanged).**

In simple terms: The variable `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. All other variables (`arr`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i`) remain in their previous states except that `i` is increased by 1. The condition determining whether `max_segment` or `new_segment` is updated is not changed.
