Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with `new_segment[0]` updated by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]` (if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` or remains unchanged, and `max_segment[0]` is adjusted accordingly; if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`), `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0, and `max_sum` remains `-1`.**
