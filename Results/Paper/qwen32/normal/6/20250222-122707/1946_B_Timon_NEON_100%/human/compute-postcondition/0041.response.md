The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. The new segment is created by adding the current value of `i - 1` to the `new_segment` list. This means that the `segments_variants` list now includes this new segment.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated such that `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` includes the new segment `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is updated accordingly, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the `segments_variants` list now has a new entry which is the `new_segment` list with the index `i - 1` added to it. All other variables retain their described states.
