The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is created by concatenating `new_segment` with a list containing the length of `arr` minus 1. Given the initial state, `new_segment` is `[2, 5]` and the length of `arr` is 6, so `len(arr) - 1` equals 5. Therefore, the new list to be appended is `[2, 5, 5]`.

Output State: **arr: [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2], new_segment: [2, 5], max_segment: [11, 0], segments_variants: [[1, 0, 0], [8, 2, 3], [11, 0, 5], [2, 5, 5]], max_sum: -1.**

In natural language: The `segments_variants` list has been updated to include a new segment `[2, 5, 5]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
