The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is the concatenation of `max_segment` and `[i - 1]`. This means `segments_variants` will now contain a new list as its last element, where this list is formed by adding `i - 1` to the end of `max_segment`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one list `[0, 0, i - 1]`, `max_sum` is `-1`, the current element `arr[i]` is less than 0, and `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`.**
