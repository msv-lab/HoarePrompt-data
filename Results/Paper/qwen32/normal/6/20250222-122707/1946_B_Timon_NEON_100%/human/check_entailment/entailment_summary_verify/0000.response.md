### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the given program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number. It's a straightforward utility function.
   - **Evaluation**: Correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum contiguous subarray in the array `arr` and return it along with its start and end indices.
   - **Analysis**:
     - The function seems to be a variation of Kadane's algorithm.
     - It correctly identifies the maximum sum subarray and handles negative numbers to some extent.
     - However, there are issues:
       - It does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is empty or has only one element.
       - It does not handle cases where all elements are negative correctly.
       - The logic for resetting `new_segment` and `max_segment` is not robust.
   - **Evaluation**: Partially correct but needs improvement.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations.
   - **Analysis**:
     - The function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to perform the operations or calculate the sum.
     - It is supposed to take the length of the array and the number of operations as parameters and return the computed sum.
     - The provided function summary does not indicate any logic for performing the operations, which is a critical part of solving the problem.
   - **Evaluation**: Incorrect and incomplete.

#### Function Summary Recap
- **Function `func_3`**: The summary indicates that the function computes the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, but the provided code does not include this logic.

#### Original Assessment Recap
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the code does not implement the logic to perform the operations and compute the maximum sum after `k` operations.
- It also points out that `func_2` has issues with handling edge cases and negative numbers.
- The assessment concludes that the code is incorrect.

#### Final Evaluation
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate. The code does not fully implement the required logic to solve the problem, particularly the operations described in the problem statement. The incomplete `func_3` and the issues in `func_2` contribute to the code being incorrect.

### Final: **False**
