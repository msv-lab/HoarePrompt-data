To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the code, and the annotated version.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number.
   - The function is used to ensure the final answer is within the required range.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum contiguous subarray in the array `arr` using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm.
   - The function seems to be correctly identifying the maximum sum subarray and its end index, but there are issues with how it handles negative numbers and resetting segments.
   - The function's logic for handling negative numbers and resetting `new_segment` and `max_segment` is flawed, as noted in the original assessment.
   - The function returns the maximum sum subarray along with its start and end indices, but the implementation is not robust enough to handle all edge cases.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem as described.

4. **Main Code**:
   - The main logic is to find the maximum sum subarray using `func_2`, and then compute the final sum based on the maximum sum subarray and the number of operations `k`.
   - The formula used for the final sum is `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`, which seems to be an attempt to maximize the sum by repeatedly adding the maximum sum subarray.
   - However, this formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for inserting the sum of subarrays in the optimal way.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations provide insight into the state of the program at different points.
- The annotations show that `func_2` is returning the correct maximum sum subarray for the given example, but the logic is not robust for all cases.
- The main logic for computing the final sum is flawed, as it does not correctly simulate the `k` operations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided code does not implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations as described in the problem statement. The main issues are:
1. The logic in `func_2` for handling negative numbers and resetting segments is flawed.
2. The main logic for computing the final sum is incorrect and does not simulate the `k` operations properly.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
