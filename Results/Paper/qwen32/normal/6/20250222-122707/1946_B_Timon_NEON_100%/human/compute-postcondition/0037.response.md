Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer; `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`, where `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`; `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0; `max_sum` remains `-1`; `new_segment` is either `[arr[i], i]` if `new_segment` was empty and `arr[i]` is non-negative; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `arr[i]` is non-negative; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of the first element in `max_segment` has been increased by the value of `arr[i]`. The other variables retain their previous states unless `arr[i]` was non-negative, in which case `new_segment` is updated accordingly.
