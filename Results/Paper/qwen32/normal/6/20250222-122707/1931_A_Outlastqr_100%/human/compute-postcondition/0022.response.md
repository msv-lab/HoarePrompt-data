The code snippet `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` modifies the `word` variable by appending the string `'a'` followed by the character at the index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and then appending `'z'`. 

Given that `alphabet` is the string of lowercase English letters, `alphabet[n - 28]` will be the character at the position `n - 28` in this string. Therefore, `word` will become `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.**
