The code snippet assigns the string `'aay'` to the variable `word`. This change affects the `word` variable, which was initially an empty string. The values of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is `'aay'`.**
