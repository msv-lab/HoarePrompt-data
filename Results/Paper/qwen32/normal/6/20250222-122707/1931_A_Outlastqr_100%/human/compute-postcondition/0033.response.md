The code snippet appends a string to the `word` variable, which is initially empty. The string to be appended is constructed as 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'. Given that `alphabet` contains the lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `alphabet[n - 28]` will be the letter at the position `n - 28` in the alphabet. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `n - 28` must be between 0 and 25 (inclusive) for `alphabet[n - 28]` to be a valid letter. Therefore, `n` must be between 28 and 53 (inclusive).

The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `i` is described as `i + 2` in the initial state, but since `i` is not used in the code snippet, its value remains `i + 2`. The value of `n` remains the same as it is only used to index into the `alphabet` string. The value of `alphabet` also remains unchanged.

The `word` variable, which was initially an empty string, is now 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'. For example, if `n` is 29, then `alphabet[n - 28]` is 'b', and `word` becomes 'abz'. If `n` is 52, then `alphabet[n - 28]` is 'y', and `word` becomes 'ayz'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 2`, `word` is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'**.
