The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 78 and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The printed string is determined by specific rules: if `n` > 52, the string is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`; if `n` is 27, the string is `'aay'`; if 28 <= `n` <= 52, the string is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`; if `n` is less than or equal to 26, the string is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
