The code splits the input string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list to the variable `lst`. The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.**
