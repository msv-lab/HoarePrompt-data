You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is equal to the number of test cases executed, `ans_f` is a list containing the accumulated sum of the minimum values from the first two elements of `lst` for each test case, `n` is the input integer for the last test case, `l` is the input string for the last test case, `lst` is a list with 2 or fewer elements for the last test case, and `i` is `n * 2` for the last test case if the loop executed all iterations without breaking early.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: All elements in `ans_f` are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` indicating the number of pairs of integers, and a list of 2n integers. For each test case, the function evaluates the pairs and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to these pairs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
