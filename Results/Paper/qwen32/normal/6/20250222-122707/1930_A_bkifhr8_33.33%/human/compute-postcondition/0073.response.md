The code snippet `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` updates the value of `ans` by adding the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of the list `lst` to it. 

Given the initial state, `lst` is a list of substrings from the input string `l` split by spaces and has exactly 2 elements. Therefore, `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` are the integer representations of these two substrings. The `min` function will return the smaller of these two integer values, which is then added to `ans`.

Since `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers from `lst`. The values of `t`, `ans_f`, `n`, `l`, `lst`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces and has exactly 2 elements, `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2.**
