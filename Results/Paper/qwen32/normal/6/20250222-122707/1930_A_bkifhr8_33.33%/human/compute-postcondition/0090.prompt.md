Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is 0, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is either a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with its first and third elements removed or a list with exactly 2 elements, and `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2. If `lst` does not have exactly 2 elements, the first and third elements are removed from `lst`. If `lst` has exactly 2 elements, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst` plus the same minimum value again, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is either the list after removing the element at index 2 if its length was not 2, or a list with exactly 2 elements, and `i` is `n * 2 + 1`. If `lst`'s length was not 2, the loop or if statement breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is double the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, and `i` is 0. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` is a list with either 1 or 2 elements after removing the element at index 0. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
