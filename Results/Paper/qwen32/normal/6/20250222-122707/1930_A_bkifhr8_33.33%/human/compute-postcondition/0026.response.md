The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. Given that `lst` is a list of substrings from the input string `l` with the first element removed, and assuming `lst` has at least three elements, the element at index 2 will be removed.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first element removed and the third element (index 2) removed, `i` is 5, `ans` is the sum of its previous value (assumed 0) and the minimum of the first two integers in the original `lst`.**
