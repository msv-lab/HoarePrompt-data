The code snippet `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` into a list of substrings wherever there is a space. This means `lst` will now hold the words or substrings from `l` as its elements.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2.
- `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice.
- `ans` is 0.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `l` is the new input string.
- `lst` has 2 or fewer elements.
- `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2.

After the execution of `lst = l.split(' ')`:
- `lst` is updated to be a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

The Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is 0, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2.**
