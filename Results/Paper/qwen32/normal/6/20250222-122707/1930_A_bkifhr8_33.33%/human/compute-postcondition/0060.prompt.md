Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is 0. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, the loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, `lst` has the first and third elements removed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is twice the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and `i` is 1. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` has the first and third elements removed. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and `i` is 2. If `len(lst)` is not equal to 2, `ans` is three times the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and `lst` has its first and third elements removed. If `len(lst)` is equal to 2, `ans` is its previous value plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
