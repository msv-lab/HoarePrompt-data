Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is twice the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `t`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, `l`, `lst`, and `i` remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
