Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and the length of `lst` is exactly 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
