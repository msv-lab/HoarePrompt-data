Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `n` remains the same integer representing the number of nodes in the tree. The variable `t` remains as 1, indicating there is one starting node for the round. The tree, represented by `n-1` edges, is fully constructed with each node (from 1 to n) having its adjacent nodes stored in the `defaultdict` `lst`. The variable `x` is the total number of edges (which is `n-1`), and `y` holds the value of the last integer read from the input, which is part of the last edge input. The `lst` defaultdict now contains the complete adjacency list for the entire tree, reflecting the connections between all nodes.
