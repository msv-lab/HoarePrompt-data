The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. Therefore, `y` will now hold the value of the last element of `lst[x]` before it was removed. The list `lst[x]` will be modified to no longer include this element.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is the starting node `u_1`
- `y` is the last node visited before `lst[x]` became empty
- `lst[x]` must be a non-empty list
- `s` is True

After the code execution:
- `y` will be the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped.
- `lst[x]` will have one less element than before, specifically the last element will be removed.
- `x` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the starting node `u_1`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `lst[x]` is a list with one less element than before, `s` is True.**
