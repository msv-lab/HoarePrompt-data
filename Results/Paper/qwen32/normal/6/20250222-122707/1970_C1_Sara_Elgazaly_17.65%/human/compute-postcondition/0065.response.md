Postcondition: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, and `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `lst[y]` is an empty list, the state remains as described except for the condition on `lst[y]`.**
