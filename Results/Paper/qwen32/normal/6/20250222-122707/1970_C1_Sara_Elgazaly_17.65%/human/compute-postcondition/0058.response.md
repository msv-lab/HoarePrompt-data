Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `lst[x]` is a list with one less element than before, `s` is True, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list.**

In simple terms: The value of `x` is now the same as the value of `y`, which is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped. The other variables remain unchanged.
