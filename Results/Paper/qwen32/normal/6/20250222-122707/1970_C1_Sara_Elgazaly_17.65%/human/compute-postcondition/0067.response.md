The code `y = lst[x].pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. Since `lst[x]` must not be empty, there is at least one element to pop. The variable `x` is not changed by this operation, and `s` remains True. The value of `y` is updated to the last element of `lst[x]` that was popped.

Given the initial state, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, and `y` is the second last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped. After executing the code, `y` is now the last element of `lst[x]` that was popped, and the list `lst[x]` has one less element than before.

Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, and `s` is True.**
