The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. Since `_` does not represent any state that we need to adjust, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration, except for the loop control variable which is implicitly managed by the `range` function.

Given that the loop runs `x - 1` times, at the start of each iteration, the loop control variable is implicitly set to the next integer in the sequence generated by `range(x - 1)`. Since we are not modifying `_` directly, we only need to acknowledge that the loop will continue as long as the condition `x - 1` iterations is not met.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 3, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` containing `b` and `lst[b]` containing `a` and now `lst[b]` includes `a` as an additional element.**
