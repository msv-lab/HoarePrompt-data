Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes representing the entire tree structure, `s` is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x] != []:
    while lst[x]:
        y = lst[x].pop()
        if lst[y] != []:
            x = y
            break
    s = not s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last node visited before `x` became a leaf, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where the path from the starting node to the leaf node has all intermediate nodes' adjacency lists reduced, and `s` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is the starting node `u_1`, `y` is the last node visited before `lst[x]` became empty, `lst[x]` is an empty list, `s` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` that was popped in the last iteration, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` that was popped in the last iteration, `lst[x]` is an empty list, and `s` is False.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
