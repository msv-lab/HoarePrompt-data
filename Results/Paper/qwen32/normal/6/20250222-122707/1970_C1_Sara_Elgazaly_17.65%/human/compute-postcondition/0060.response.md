Postcondition: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `lst[x]` is a list with one less element than before, `s` is True, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list if the if condition is met. If `lst[y]` is an empty list, the else part does not execute, and the state remains as described except for the condition on `lst[y]`.**
