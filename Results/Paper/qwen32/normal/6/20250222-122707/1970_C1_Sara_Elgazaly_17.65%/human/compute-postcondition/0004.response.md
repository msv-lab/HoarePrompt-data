The code snippet `lst[a].append(b)` modifies the defaultdict `lst` by appending the value `b` to the list associated with the key `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 2, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` containing `b`, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input`.**

In simpler terms, the list associated with key `a` in the defaultdict `lst` now includes the value `b`. All other variables retain their initial values.
