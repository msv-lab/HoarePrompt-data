The provided code `y = lst[x].pop()` will remove and return the last element of the list `lst[x]` and assign it to the variable `y`. Given the initial state, `y` was already the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped. After the execution of the code, `y` will hold the value that was the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, and `lst[x]` will have one less element.

Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, `s` is True, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list if the if condition is met. If `lst[y]` is an empty list, the else part does not execute, and the state remains as described except for the condition on `lst[y]`.**

In simpler terms: The last element of `lst[x]` is removed and assigned to `y`, reducing the length of `lst[x]` by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
