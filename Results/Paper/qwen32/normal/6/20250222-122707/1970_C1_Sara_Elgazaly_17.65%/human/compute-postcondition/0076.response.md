Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` edges representing the tree structure, and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node. The function returns the length of the longest path starting from the node `u_1` to any other node in the tree, given that the tree has exactly two leaves.**
