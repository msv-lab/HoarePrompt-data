Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly as specified in the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
