Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is greater than 3; `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now specific integers provided by the user, each between 0 and 9 inclusive.
