Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three integers and checks the conditions for "STAIR", "PEAK", and "NONE". The conditions are checked using the appropriate comparison operators, and the correct string is printed based on the conditions. The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, which matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
