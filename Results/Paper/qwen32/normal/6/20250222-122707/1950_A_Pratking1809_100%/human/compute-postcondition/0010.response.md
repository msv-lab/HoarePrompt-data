Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is greater than 0; it is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. If `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.**
