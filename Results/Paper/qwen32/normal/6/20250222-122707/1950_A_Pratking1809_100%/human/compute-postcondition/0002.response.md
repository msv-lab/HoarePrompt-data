The code snippet provided takes three integer inputs and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` is not affected, and `q` is mentioned to be greater than 0, but it is not used in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated based on the input, while `t` and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` must be greater than 0.**
