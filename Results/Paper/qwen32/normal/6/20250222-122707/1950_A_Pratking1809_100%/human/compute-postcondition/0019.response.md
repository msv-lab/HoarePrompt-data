The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `q`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `q` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is greater than 3; `i` is 3**
