The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the current element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now include the element `lit[i]` as its last element. The values of other variables remain unchanged, except for `a`, which is updated to include the new element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list that now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `b` is a list (either empty or not empty), `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list before appending or the last element of `a` before appending, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
