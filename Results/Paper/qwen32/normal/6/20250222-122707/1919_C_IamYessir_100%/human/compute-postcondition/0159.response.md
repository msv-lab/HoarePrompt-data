The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This changes the list `b` by adding a new element to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless `b` was previously empty and now contains one element, which would affect the value of `y`.

If `b` was previously empty, `y` was `float('inf')`. After appending `lit[i]` to `b`, `y` should be updated to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]` in this case. If `b` was not empty, `y` remains the last element of `b` before the append operation.

The variable `s` (the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element) may also change depending on the value of `lit[i]` relative to the last element of `b` before the append operation. If `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of `b` before the append operation, `s` should be incremented by 1. If `lit[i]` is not greater, `s` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is a list (either empty or not empty) with `lit[i]` appended to it, `cp` is 0, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b`, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, and `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty or the last element of `b` after the append operation if `b` was not empty. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. The current value of `lit[i]` satisfies `y >= lit[i] > x`.**
