The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `cp`, `lit`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, but the code snippet itself does not change `i` again.

Since `a.append(lit[i])` modifies the list `a` by adding a new element, the list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end. If `a` was empty before this operation, it will now contain one element, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list that now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` was empty before and now `lit[i]` if `a` was not empty, `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**
