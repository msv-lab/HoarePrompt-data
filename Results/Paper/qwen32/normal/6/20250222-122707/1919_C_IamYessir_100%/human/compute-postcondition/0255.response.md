The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `len(b) - 1` if `a` was not initially empty, and `-1` if `a` was initially empty. However, the value of `i` is irrelevant to the specific element being appended as long as `i` is a valid index in `lit`. 

Since `b` is a list and we are appending an element to it, the length of `b` will increase by 1. The value of `y`, which is the last element of `b`, will now be the element that was just appended, i.e., `lit[i]`.

The other variables (`a`, `s`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list with one more element, `lit[i]`, appended; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`.**
