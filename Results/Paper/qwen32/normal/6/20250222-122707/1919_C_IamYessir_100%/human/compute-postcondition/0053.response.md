Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**
