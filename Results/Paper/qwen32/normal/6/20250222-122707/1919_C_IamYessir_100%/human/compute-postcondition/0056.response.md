The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. The value of `a` is now updated to include this new element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` was an empty list before this operation, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit`, `b` is a list, `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**
