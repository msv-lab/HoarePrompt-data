Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers distributed based on the conditions, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` > `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
