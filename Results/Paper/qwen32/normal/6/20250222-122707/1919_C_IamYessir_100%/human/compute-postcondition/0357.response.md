Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints the count of times an element in two derived lists `a` and `b` is greater than the previous element. The derived lists are populated based on specific conditions related to the input list.**
