The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This operation modifies the list `b`, but does not affect the values of `a`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `x`, or `y` directly.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions.
- `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is greater than `i`.
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.

After executing the code snippet, the list `b` will have an additional element, `lit[i]`, appended to it. Therefore, `b` is now `b + [lit[i]]`. The value of `y` will be updated to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is `b + [lit[i]]`; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`.**
