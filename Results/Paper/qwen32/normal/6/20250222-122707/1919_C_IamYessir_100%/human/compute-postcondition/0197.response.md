The code appends the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `b`. Therefore, the list `b` will now have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of the list `b`. `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
