Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list that now includes the element `lit[i]` (previously `a` was either empty or not empty), `b` is a list (either empty or not empty), `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is the last element of `a` (previously `x` was either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list or the last element of `a` if `a` was not empty), and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. Furthermore, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`. The current value of `lit[i]` satisfies `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`.**

In natural language: The list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]`. The value of `x` has been updated to the last element of `a`, which is `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
