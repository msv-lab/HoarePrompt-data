The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now contain one more element, which is `lit[i]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the list `b` was either empty or contained some elements. After appending `lit[i]`, `b` will no longer be empty, and `y` will be updated to the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list containing at least one more element `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` or `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, `y` is `lit[i]`, `x` is less than `y` and `x` is not equal to `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`.**
