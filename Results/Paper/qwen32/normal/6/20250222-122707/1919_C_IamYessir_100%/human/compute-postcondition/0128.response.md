The given code snippet assigns the value of the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The initial state indicates that `a` is not an empty list, so `a[-1]` will always be a valid operation.

Since `a` is not an empty list, `x` will take the value of the last element of `a`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is not an empty list, `b` is [], `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is the last element of `a`.**
