The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, this will change the list `a` by adding the element `lit[i]` to it.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`a` is a list that now includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `b` is a list (either empty or not); `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `x` is not equal to `y`; `x` is less than `y`; `lit[i]` is greater than `y`; and `x` is less than `lit[i]`.**
