Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and `x` was initially `float('inf')`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is not greater than `y` and `x` is not initially `float('inf')`, `x` remains the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and `x` is not initially `float('inf')`, `x` remains the last element of `a` unless `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, `a` is not an empty list and `lit[i]` has been appended to `a`.**

To simplify:
Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` may or may not have `lit[i]` appended; `s` counts how many times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is still greater than `i`; `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, it is appended to `b`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and `x` was initially `float('inf')`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` if `a` is not empty.**
