Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` was an empty list before this operation, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. `b` is a list, `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, no changes are made to `a`, `x`, `b`, or `y`.**
