Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i] > y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`, then `b` includes `lit[i]` from the previous value of `i` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If neither condition is met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`. `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts and their conditions.
