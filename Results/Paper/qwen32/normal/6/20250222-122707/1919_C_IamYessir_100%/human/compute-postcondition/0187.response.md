Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x == y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains unchanged. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `y ≥ lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and neither `lit[i] > y` nor `y ≥ lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` remains unchanged. If `x < y` and `a` is not empty, `x` is set to the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is `float('inf')`. If `x < y` and `b` is not empty, `y` is set to the last element of `b`; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x` is not less than `y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`.**
