Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` is updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i] > y`, and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > x`, then `b` has `lit[i]` appended, `s` is incremented by 1, and `y` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x >= lit[i] > y`, then `lit[i]` is added to `a`, `b` remains unchanged, and `y` is set to `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if not. In all cases, `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`.**
