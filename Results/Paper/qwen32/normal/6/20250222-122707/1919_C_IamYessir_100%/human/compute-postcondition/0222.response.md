The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The initial state does not mention `s`, so we can infer that `s` must have been defined before this code snippet and holds some integer value. After the execution of `s += 1`, the value of `s` will be its previous value plus one. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `s` is `s + 1`.**
