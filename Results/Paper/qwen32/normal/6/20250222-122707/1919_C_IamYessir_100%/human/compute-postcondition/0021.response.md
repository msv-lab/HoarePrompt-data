The code appends the current value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This affects the list `b` by adding a new element. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the line of code. 

Given that `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, and `x` is the last element of `a` (if `a` is not empty), this new element in `b` does not affect the conditions regarding `x` and `y` directly, but it does change the state of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list that now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
