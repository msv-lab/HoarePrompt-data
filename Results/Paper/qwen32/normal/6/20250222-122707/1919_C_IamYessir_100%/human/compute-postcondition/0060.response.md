The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This operation modifies the list `a` by adding one more element to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is incremented by 1
- If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`.
- If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.

After executing the code snippet, `a` now includes the element `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` now includes `lit[i]`, `x` is set to the last element of `lit` (or positive infinity if `a` was initially empty), `y` is set to the last element of `b` (or positive infinity if `b` is empty).**
