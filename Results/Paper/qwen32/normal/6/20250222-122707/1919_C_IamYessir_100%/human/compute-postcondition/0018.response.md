The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This operation modifies the list `b` by adding a new element to it.

Given the initial state, `b` is a list that may or may not be empty, and `lit` is a list of integers. After executing the code, `b` will have one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

The other variables such as `t`, `n`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `b` is a list with the additional element `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
