The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cp` to 0. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the value of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0.**
