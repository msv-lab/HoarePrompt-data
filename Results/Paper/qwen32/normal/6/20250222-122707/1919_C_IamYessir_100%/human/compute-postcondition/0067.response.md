Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x < y`, the following cases apply: If `x >= lit[i]`, `a` contains the element `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` was empty before the operation, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `lit` before this operation, and `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `x < lit[i]`, `y >= lit[i]`, and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If none of the above conditions are met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`. `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x >= y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
