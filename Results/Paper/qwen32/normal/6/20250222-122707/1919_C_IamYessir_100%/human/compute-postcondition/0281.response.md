Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list (either empty or not); `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1` if the if part was taken, or `len(b) - 1` if the else part was taken; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if the if part was taken, or `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]` if the if part was taken, or `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` if the else part was taken; `x` is not equal to `y`. If `x < y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `i` is decremented by 1. If `x >= y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`.**
