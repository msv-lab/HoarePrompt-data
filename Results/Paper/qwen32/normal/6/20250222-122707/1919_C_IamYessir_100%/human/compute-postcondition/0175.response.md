The code snippet appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will now contain one more element than before, specifically the element at index `i` from `lit`.

Since `a` has been modified by appending a new element, the value of `x` will now be the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), because `x` is set to the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list with the `i`-th element of `lit` appended, `b` is a list that is modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`.**
