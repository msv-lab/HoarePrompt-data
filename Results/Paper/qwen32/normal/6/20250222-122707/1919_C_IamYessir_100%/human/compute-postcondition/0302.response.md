Postcondition: **`a` is a list that includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `lit[i] > y`. Otherwise, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list. `b` has `lit[i]` appended if `y >= lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged. `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element. `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`. `n` is greater than `i`. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `cp` is 0. `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty and `y >= lit[i] > x`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before any potential appending.**
