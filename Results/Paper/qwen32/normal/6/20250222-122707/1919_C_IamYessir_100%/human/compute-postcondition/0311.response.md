Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')`.**

In simple terms, the variable `y` is now set to `float('inf')`, and all other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
