The code assigns a new value to the variable `x`, setting it to `float('inf')`. This means `x` is now set to positive infinity. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, the length of `a` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')`.**
