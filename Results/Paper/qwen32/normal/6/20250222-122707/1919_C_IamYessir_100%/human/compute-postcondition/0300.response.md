The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This affects the list `b` and potentially the variable `y` if `b` was not empty before the operation. The other variables remain unchanged unless `b` was empty, in which case `y` is updated to the newly appended element.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions.
- `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
- `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`.
- `n` is greater than `i`.
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cp` is 0.
- `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.

After executing the code `b.append(lit[i])`:
- `b` now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end.
- If `b` was previously empty, `y` is now `lit[i]`.
- If `b` was not empty, `y` remains the last element of `b` before the append operation, which means `y` is still `lit[i-1]` if `b` had elements before.
- The other variables (`a`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` has `lit[i]` appended; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before appending `lit[i]`.**
