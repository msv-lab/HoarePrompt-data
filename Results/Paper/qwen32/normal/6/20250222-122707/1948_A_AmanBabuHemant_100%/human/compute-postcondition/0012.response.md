Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is the integer value provided by the input and `n` is even, `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, then the length of `s` is indeed less than 200. Otherwise, the length of `s` is 200 or more.**
