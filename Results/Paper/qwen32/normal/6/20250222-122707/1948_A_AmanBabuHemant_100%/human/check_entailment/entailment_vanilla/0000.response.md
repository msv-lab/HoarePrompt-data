Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to create a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in this string. A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example:
- In the string "AAABAACC", the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. This means 'A' at position 1 is special because it's equal to its right neighbor 'A', 'A' at position 3 is special because it's equal to its right neighbor 'A' but different from its left neighbor 'B', and so on.

### Key Observations

1. **Special Characters in Patterns:**
   - To create a special character, we need a pattern where a character is equal to one of its neighbors but not both. For example, in the pattern "AAB", the middle 'A' is special because it's equal to the 'A' on its left but different from the 'B' on its right.

2. **Counting Special Characters:**
   - In the pattern "AAB", there are 2 special characters: the middle 'A' and the 'B'.
   - Therefore, in the pattern "AAB" repeated `k` times, there will be `2k` special characters.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - To have exactly `n` special characters, `n` must be even because each "AAB" pattern contributes 2 special characters.
   - If `n` is odd, it's impossible to form a string with exactly `n` special characters using the pattern "AAB".

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
```

1. **Handling Odd `n`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd (`n % 2 != 0`), it's impossible to create a string with exactly `n` special characters, so it prints "NO".

2. **Handling Even `n`:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - It then checks if the length of this string is less than 200, which is always true for `n <= 50` because the maximum length of the string is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, well below 200.
   - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both cases:
- It correctly identifies when it's impossible to form a string with exactly `n` special characters (when `n` is odd).
- It correctly constructs and prints a valid string when `n` is even.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
