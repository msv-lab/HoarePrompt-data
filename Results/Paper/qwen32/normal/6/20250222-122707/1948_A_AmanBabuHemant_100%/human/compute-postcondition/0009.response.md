Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` is an integer value provided by the input, and `n` is even.
- `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `s`:**
   - `s` is constructed by repeating the string `'AAB'` a specific number of times.
   - The number of times `'AAB'` is repeated is `n // 2`.
   - Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will always be an integer.

2. **Form of the output string `s`:**
   - If `n` is 2, `s` will be `'AAB'` repeated once, resulting in `'AAB'`.
   - If `n` is 4, `s` will be `'AAB'` repeated twice, resulting in `'AABAAB'`.
   - If `n` is 6, `s` will be `'AAB'` repeated three times, resulting in `'AABAABAAB'`.
   - And so on...

### General Form:
- For any even `n`, the string `s` will be `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The exact string printed will depend on the value of `n`.

### Example:
- If `n` is 4, the output will be `'AABAAB'`.
- If `n` is 6, the output will be `'AABAABAAB'`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact string. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Output:
The `print(s)` statement will print the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **AAB repeated n // 2 times (where n is the even integer input)**
