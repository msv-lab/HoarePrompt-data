Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the problem requirements as described. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading the integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: If `n` is odd, the program correctly outputs 'NO' because it's not possible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times. The substring 'AAB' has 2 special characters ('A' at index 1 and 'B' at index 2 if 'AAB' is considered starting from index 0). Thus, repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times will result in a string with exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. Since the maximum `n` is 50, the maximum length of `s` would be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the 200-character limit. Therefore, the length check is redundant but does not affect correctness.

5. **Output**: The program outputs 'YES' followed by the constructed string `s` for even `n` and 'NO' for odd `n`.

Given this analysis, the program meets all the requirements of the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
