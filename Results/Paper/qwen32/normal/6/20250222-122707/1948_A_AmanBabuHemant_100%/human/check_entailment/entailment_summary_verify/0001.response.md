Let's analyze the given problem, the provided code, and the function summary systematically to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC", the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

### Key Observations

1. **Special Characters in Patterns:**
   - A pattern like "AAB" has 2 special characters: the middle 'A' (equal to the left 'A' but different from the right 'B') and the 'B' (different from the left 'A' but equal to the right 'A').
   - Therefore, repeating "AAB" `k` times will result in `2k` special characters.

2. **Counting Special Characters:**
   - To have exactly `n` special characters, `n` must be even because each "AAB" pattern contributes 2 special characters.
   - If `n` is odd, it is impossible to form a string with exactly `n` special characters using the pattern "AAB".

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times.
   - The length of the resulting string is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than 200 for `n <= 50` (since `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`).

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
```

1. **Handling Odd `n`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd (`n % 2 != 0`), it is impossible to create a string with exactly `n` special characters, so it prints "NO".

2. **Handling Even `n`:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - It then checks if the length of this string is less than 200, which is always true for `n <= 50` because the maximum length of the string is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, well below 200.
   - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both cases:
- It correctly identifies when it is impossible to form a string with exactly `n` special characters (when `n` is odd).
- It correctly constructs and prints a valid string when `n` is even.

### Function Summary Validation

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the code:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`.
- If `n` is odd, it prints "NO".
- If `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times and checks if the length is less than 200.
- If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis and the function summary, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the given constraints and requirements.

Final: **True**
