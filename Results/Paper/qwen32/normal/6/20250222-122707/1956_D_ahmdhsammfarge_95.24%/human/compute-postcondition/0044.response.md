Postcondition: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `i`, `l` is updated to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, and `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`.**
