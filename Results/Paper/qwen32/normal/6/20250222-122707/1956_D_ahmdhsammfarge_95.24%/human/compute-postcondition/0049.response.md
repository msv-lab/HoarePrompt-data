Postcondition: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`. If `sm > over_sum`, then `r` is updated to the value of `i` and `l` is updated to the value of `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `over_sum` retain their original values.**
