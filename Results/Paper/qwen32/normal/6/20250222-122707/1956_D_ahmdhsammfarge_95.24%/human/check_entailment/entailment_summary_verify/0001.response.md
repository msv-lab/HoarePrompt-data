### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly replacing subarrays with their MEX (minimum excluded value). The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the set.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - **Purpose**: Find the optimal subarray `[i:j]` to replace with its MEX to maximize the sum.
   - **Implementation**: The function iterates over all possible subarrays `[i:j]` and calculates the new sum if the subarray is replaced by its MEX value. The formula used is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.
   - **Issue**: The formula `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + MEX(lst[i:j+1]) * (j - i + 1)`, where `MEX(lst[i:j+1])` is the MEX of the subarray.

2. **Function 2: `func_2`**
   - **Purpose**: Generate a sequence of operations to replace a subarray `[r:l]` with its MEX value.
   - **Implementation**: The function is recursive and appends operations to the list `ops`. However, the logic is unclear and does not seem to generate the required operations correctly.
   - **Issue**: The recursive calls and the operations appended do not clearly correspond to the operations needed to replace the subarray with its MEX value.

3. **Function 3: `func_3`**
   - **Purpose**: Perform the replacement of the subarray `[r:l]` with its MEX value, update the list, and generate the corresponding operations.
   - **Implementation**: The function appends operations without ensuring that the MEX value is correctly calculated or applied.
   - **Issue**: The operations appended are not guaranteed to correctly reflect the MEX replacement, and the logic for replacing the subarray is flawed.

#### Function Summary:
- **Function 3**: The summary states that the function modifies the sublist from index `r` to `l` by setting all elements to the length `n` of that sublist and appends specific operations. However, this does not align with the correct MEX replacement logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the new sum, generating operations, and replacing subarrays with their MEX values is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
