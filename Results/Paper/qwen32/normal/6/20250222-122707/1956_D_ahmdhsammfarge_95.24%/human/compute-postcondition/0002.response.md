The code snippet appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and the condition that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0 is still valid after the operation. The only change is that `ops` now includes the new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` as its last element.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers, with the additional element `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**
