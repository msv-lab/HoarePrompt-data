To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop progresses and how the variables `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` are updated based on the conditions provided.

Here is the loop code for reference:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm
```

Given the initial state:
- `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 1 element.
- `r` is 0.
- `l` is 0.
- `over_sum` is the sum of the elements in `lst`.

Let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `over_sum` is initially the sum of all elements in `lst`.

2. **First Iteration (j = 1)**:
   - `sm` is calculated as `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[2:]) + (1 - 0 + 1) ** 2`, which simplifies to `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`.
   - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `r` and `l` are updated to `0` and `1` respectively, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.

3. **Second Iteration (j = 2)**:
   - `sm` is calculated as `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[3:]) + (2 - 0 + 1) ** 2`, which simplifies to `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`.
   - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `r` and `l` are updated to `0` and `2` respectively, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.

4. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each `j` from 3 to `len(lst) - 1`, the same process is followed.
   - `sm` is calculated as `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - 0 + 1) ** 2`, which simplifies to `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1) ** 2`.
   - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `r` and `l` are updated to `0` and `j` respectively, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.

The loop continues until `j` reaches `len(lst) - 1`.

### Final Output State:
- `r` will be `0` because `i` is always `0` in the loop.
- `l` will be the value of `j` that maximizes `sm`.
- `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1) ** 2` for all valid `j`.

In natural language:
The output state after the loop finishes executing is that `r` remains `0`, `l` is the index `j` that maximizes the sum of the elements after `j` plus the square of `j + 1`, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of this calculated sum.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is the index `j` that maximizes `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1) ** 2`, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of this calculated sum.**
