Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r` and `l`, which are integers representing a range within the list `lst`, and `lst`, which is a list of integers. The function modifies the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) by setting all elements in this range to the length `n` of the range (`n = l - r + 1`). The function then returns the modified list `lst`.**
