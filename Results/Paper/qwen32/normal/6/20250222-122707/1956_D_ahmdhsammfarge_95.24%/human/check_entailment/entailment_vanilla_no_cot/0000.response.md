Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find the best subarray to replace to maximize the sum, but it incorrectly calculates the sum by squaring the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which does not reflect the actual MEX operation that the problem describes. The MEX operation replaces the subarray with the smallest non-negative integer not present in it, not the length of the subarray squared.

2. **Recursive Function `func_2`**: The function `func_2` is supposed to generate operations to set all elements in the range `[r, l]` to the MEX value, but it incorrectly calls itself recursively and generates operations that do not necessarily achieve the goal of maximizing the sum.

3. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX value for any subarray. The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, which is not computed anywhere in the program.

4. **Inefficient and Incorrect Operations**: The operations generated by the program do not necessarily lead to the maximum sum, and the logic for generating operations is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
- Compute the MEX value for different subarrays.
- Replace subarrays with their MEX value to maximize the sum.
- Keep track of the operations performed.

A correct solution would involve a different approach, possibly using dynamic programming or a greedy strategy, to efficiently find the optimal subarrays to replace.
