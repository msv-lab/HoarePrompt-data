The code snippet provided assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Therefore, `over_sum` will now hold the value that `sm` held before the assignment.

Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `i` is `l + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `l + 2 <= len(lst)`**

In natural language: The value of `over_sum` has been updated to match the value of `sm`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
