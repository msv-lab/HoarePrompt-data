The code calculates the value of `sm` based on the given expression and assigns it to the variable `sm`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet. The variable `j` is also not defined in the snippet, so its value is unknown, but it is used in the calculation of `sm`.

Output State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**.
