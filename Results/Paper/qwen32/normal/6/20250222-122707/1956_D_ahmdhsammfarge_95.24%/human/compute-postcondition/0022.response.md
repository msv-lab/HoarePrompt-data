Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` must be an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**

Explanation: The value of `sm` is calculated based on the given expression, using the current values of `lst`, `i`, and `j`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
