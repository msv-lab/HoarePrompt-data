### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Overview:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly selecting a subarray, computing its MEX (minimum excluded non-negative integer), and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX. We need to output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The input is read and parsed into a list `lst` of integers.
   - `ops` is initialized as an empty list to store the operations.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop continues until `r` equals `l`, where `r` and `l` are indices returned by `func_1`.
   - `func_1` computes the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2`.
   - `func_3` is called with these indices, modifies the list `lst`, and appends operations to `ops`.

3. **Handling Zeros:**
   - After the main loop, the code tries to find zeros in the list and replaces them with 1, appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.

4. **Output:**
   - The sum of the modified list `lst` and the number of operations are printed.
   - The operations are printed in the required format.

#### Functions Analysis:

1. **`func_1(lst)`:**
   - This function calculates the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2`.
   - The purpose is to find the subarray whose replacement with its MEX would maximize the overall sum.

2. **`func_2(r, l, ops)`:**
   - This function appears to be designed to append operations to `ops` in a recursive manner.
   - However, it is not used in the main loop, and its purpose is unclear in the context of the problem.

3. **`func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`:**
   - This function performs the actual replacement of the subarray from index `r` to `l` with the MEX of that subarray.
   - It appends the corresponding operations to `ops`.
   - The function also includes a recursive call to `func_2`, which is not necessary for the problem's solution.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **`func_2` is not needed:**
   - The recursive calls in `func_2` do not contribute to the solution and can be removed.

2. **Handling Zeros:**
   - The code attempts to find zeros and replace them with 1, but this is not necessary because the MEX operation will naturally handle zeros.
   - This part of the code can be removed or modified to ensure correctness.

3. **Correctness of `func_1` and `func_3`:**
   - `func_1` correctly identifies the subarray to replace.
   - `func_3` correctly performs the replacement and appends operations.

### Conclusion:

The code has some unnecessary parts and can be simplified, but the core logic seems to be correct. The main loop and the functions `func_1` and `func_3` appear to be correctly implemented for the problem.

**Correctness: True**

However, the code can be optimized and cleaned up to remove unnecessary parts. Here is a cleaned-up version of the code:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    mex_value = 0
    while mex_value in subarray:
        mex_value += 1
    return mex_value

def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = i, j
                over_sum = sm
    return r, l

def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    mex_value = mex(lst[r:l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    lst[r:l + 1] = [mex_value] * (l - r + 1)
    return lst

input()
lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
ops = []
(r, l) = func_1(lst)
while r != l:
    lst = func_3(r, l, lst, ops)
    (r, l) = func_1(lst)
print(sum(lst), len(ops))
for r in ops:
    print(*r)
```

This cleaned-up version removes the unnecessary `func_2` and the zero-handling part, focusing only on the essential operations.
