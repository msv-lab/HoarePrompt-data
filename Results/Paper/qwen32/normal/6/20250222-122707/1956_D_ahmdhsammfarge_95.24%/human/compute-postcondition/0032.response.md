The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(lst)` and `j` starts from `i + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `r` is 0
- `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`
- `i` is `l + 1`
- `j` is incremented by 1
- `sm` is calculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`

If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then:
- `r` is updated to `i`
- `l` is updated to `j`
- `i` is updated to `l + 1`
- `j` is incremented by 1
- `over_sum` is updated to `sm`

Otherwise, `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` retain their original values.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, ensuring that `j` is still less than `len(lst)`.

State: **`r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`** 

Since only `j` can be adjusted in the loop head, we increment `j` by 1:
State: **`r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1 again, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**

To be more precise, if `j` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `i + 2`:
State: **`r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**

However, since `sm` is recalculated at the start of each iteration, we don't need to specify its value in the state. Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`**
