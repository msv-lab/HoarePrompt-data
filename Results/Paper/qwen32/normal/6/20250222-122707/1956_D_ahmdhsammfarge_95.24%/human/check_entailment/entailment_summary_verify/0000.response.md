### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly selecting a segment `[l, r]` and replacing all elements in that segment with the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the segment. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Function Summaries:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Purpose: Find the best segment `[l, r]` to maximize the sum by replacing it with its MEX.
   - Implementation: The function iterates through all possible segments `[i, j]` and calculates a new sum based on the length of the segment squared. This is incorrect because it does not compute the MEX value for the segment.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Purpose: Recursively performs operations related to the segment `[r, l]`.
   - Implementation: The function appends operations to the list `ops` but does not correctly implement the logic to replace the segment with the MEX value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Purpose: Replace the segment `[r, l]` with the MEX value and update the array and operations list.
   - Implementation: The function appends specific operations and modifies the array by setting all elements in the segment to the length of the segment, which is not the MEX value.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
  - The code does not compute the MEX value for any segment. Instead, it uses the length of the segment to replace its elements, which is not the correct approach.
  
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1` calculates a sum based on the length of the segment squared, which is not related to the MEX value or the actual sum of the array after replacement.
  
- **Inadequate Operation Handling**:
  - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` append operations without correctly implementing the MEX operation.

#### Counterexample:
Let's consider the provided counterexample:

**Input:**
```
3
1 3 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13 0
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided code does not produce the correct output because it does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array as described in the problem statement. The code does not compute the MEX value, incorrectly calculates sums, and inadequately handles operations.

**Final: False**
