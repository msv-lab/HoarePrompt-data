The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range it depends on, which is `i + 1` and `len(lst)`. According to the loop statement, `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `len(lst)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The state of `i` should remain the same because it is not modified within the loop head. The other variables (`r`, `sm`, `l`, and `lst`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with more than 1 element; `i` is 0; `r` is 0; `j` is 2; `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `l` is 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.**
