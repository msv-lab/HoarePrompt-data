Correctness: **False**

The provided program only checks if the second-to-last character in the second row is a '<'. If it is, it incorrectly concludes that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). However, the robot can potentially reach (2, n) through various paths, and the logic of the program is too simplistic to capture all possible scenarios. The program does not simulate the robot's movements or consider the entire grid configuration. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
