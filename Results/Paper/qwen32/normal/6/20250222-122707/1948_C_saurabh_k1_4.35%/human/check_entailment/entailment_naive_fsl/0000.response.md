Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only checks if the second last character of the second row is '<'. If it is, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n), otherwise it can. However, this logic is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the problem description. The robot's movement is more complex and depends on the sequence of arrows in both rows and the ability to transition between rows.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
4
>>><
>><<
```

According to the program, since the second last character of the second row is '<', it will print "No". However, the robot can actually reach the cell (2, 4) with the following path: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4). Therefore, the correct output should be "Yes".

This shows that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
