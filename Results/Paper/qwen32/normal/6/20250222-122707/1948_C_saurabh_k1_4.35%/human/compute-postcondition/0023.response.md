To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the following happens:
1. An integer `n` is read, representing the length of the strings `a` and `b`.
2. Two strings `a` and `b` are read, each consisting of `n` characters that are either '<' or '>'.
3. The code checks if the second-to-last character of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 2]`) is '<'.
   - If it is, the code prints "No".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` change with each iteration of the loop:
- `t` is a counter that decreases by 1 with each iteration.
- `n` changes to the next input integer.
- `a` and `b` change to the next pair of input strings.

However, after all iterations, the only variable that retains its original value from the initial state is `t`, which becomes 0 since the loop runs `t` times.

The output state after all iterations will be determined by the outputs of each iteration of the loop, which are either "No" or "Yes" based on the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for all `t` test cases, we can only describe the final state of the loop counter `t` and the fact that the outputs for each test case have been printed.

Output State: **t is 0, and the outputs for each of the t test cases have been printed ("No" or "Yes" based on the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'`).**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop counter `t` will be 0, and the program will have printed "No" or "Yes" for each of the `t` test cases.
