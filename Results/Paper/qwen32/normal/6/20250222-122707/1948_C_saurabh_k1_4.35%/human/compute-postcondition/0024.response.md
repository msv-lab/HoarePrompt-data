Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function returns "YES" if it is possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that each pair is in the same row or one is directly above the other in the grid, and "NO" otherwise.**
