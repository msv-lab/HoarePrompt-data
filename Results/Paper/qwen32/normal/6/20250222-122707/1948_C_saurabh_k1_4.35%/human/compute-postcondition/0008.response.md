Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of `n`; `b` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer. If the second last element of `b` is the string `'<'`, then the condition of the if part is met; otherwise, the second-to-last element of `b` is not the string `'<'`.**
