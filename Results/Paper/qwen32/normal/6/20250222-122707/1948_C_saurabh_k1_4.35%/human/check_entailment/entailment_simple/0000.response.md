Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The logic implemented in the function does not accurately determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The condition `if b[n - 2] == '<':` only checks the direction of the arrow in the second-to-last cell of the second row. However, the robot can potentially reach the cell (2, n) through various paths depending on the arrows in all cells, not just the second-to-last cell of the second row. The program needs to simulate the robot's movements according to the rules provided to correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

Correctness: **False**
