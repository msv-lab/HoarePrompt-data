The given task involves an initial state where several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) are defined. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('Yes')`, which prints the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of these variables.

To break it down:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of `n`.
- `b` is a list of strings representing the digits of a new input integer, with the condition that the second-to-last element of `b` is not the string `'<'`.

Despite these variables being defined, the `print` statement does not use any of them. It directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
