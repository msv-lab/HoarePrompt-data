To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop continues to execute as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Each time the loop executes, it increments `l` and `st` by 1. The loop terminates when either `l` is no longer less than `r` or the elements at `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]` are not equal.

Given the initial state and the states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute as long as the elements in the list `a` are equal consecutively starting from index 0.

The final state of the loop will be when `l` is no longer less than `r` or `a[l] != a[l + 1]`. At this point, `l` will be the first index where the consecutive elements are not equal, and `st` will be the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0.

Let's denote the point where the loop terminates as the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` (or `k` is `r - 1` if all elements are equal).

Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `l` will be `k` (the first index where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `r` if all elements are equal).
- `st` will be `k` (the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0).
- `r` and `end` will remain unchanged as `n - 1` and `0`, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0; `end` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the loop will stop when it encounters the first pair of non-consecutive equal elements or when it reaches the end of the list. The variable `l` will point to the first such index, and `st` will reflect how many elements were consecutive and equal starting from the beginning.
