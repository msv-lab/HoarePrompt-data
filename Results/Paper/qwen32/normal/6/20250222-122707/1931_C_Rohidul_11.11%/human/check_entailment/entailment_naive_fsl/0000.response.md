Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for making all elements of the array equal with the minimum number of burles. Let's consider a few test cases that demonstrate the issue:

### Test Case 1:
**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
**Explanation:**
We can make all elements equal by changing the middle element (index 1) to either 1 or 2. This requires 1 burle.

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```
The program incorrectly calculates the answer as 2, which is not optimal.

### Test Case 2:
**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:**
We can make all elements equal to 1 by changing the middle two elements (indices 1 and 2) to 1. This requires 2 burles.

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```
The program incorrectly calculates the answer as 3, which is not optimal.

### Test Case 3:
**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:**
We can make all elements equal to 1 by changing the middle three elements (indices 1, 2, and 3) to 1. This requires 3 burles.

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```
The program incorrectly calculates the answer as 4, which is not optimal.

### Test Case 4:
**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:**
We can make all elements equal to 1 by changing the middle three elements (indices 1, 2, and 3) to 1. Alternatively, we can change the first and last three elements to 2. Both require 2 burles.

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```
The program incorrectly calculates the answer as 3, which is not optimal.

### Test Case 5:
**Input:**
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
4
```
**Explanation:**
We can make all elements equal to 1 by changing the middle four elements (indices 1, 2, 3, and 4) to 1. This requires 4 burles.

**Actual Output:**
```
5
```
The program incorrectly calculates the answer as 5, which is not optimal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where the optimal operation involves changing a middle segment of the array to make all elements equal. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not consider the optimal segment to change. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
