The code snippet decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially `n - 1`. After the operation, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `l` remains `n - 2`.
- `r` becomes `n - 2`.
- `end` remains 2.
- `ans` remains determined by initial conditions.
- `st` remains the count of consecutive equal elements from the start.
- `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]` remains true.

Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `end` is 2, `ans` is determined by initial conditions, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start, `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`**
