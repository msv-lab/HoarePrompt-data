Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and there are at least two different elements in the list; `l` is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 2` if all elements are equal; `r` is `n - 3`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0; `end` is 2**

In natural language: The value of `end` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
