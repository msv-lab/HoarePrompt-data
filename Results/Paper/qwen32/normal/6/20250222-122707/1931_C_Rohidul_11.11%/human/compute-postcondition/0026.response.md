The code snippet assigns the value of `r - l - 1` to the variable `ans`. Given the initial state, `r` and `l` are initially set to the same value, which is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 1` if all elements are equal. Therefore, `r - l - 1` will be `-1` if `l` and `r` are the same, or it will be the difference between `r` and `l` minus one if they are different.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the first and last elements are equal; `l` is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list; `ans` is `r - l - 1`.**
