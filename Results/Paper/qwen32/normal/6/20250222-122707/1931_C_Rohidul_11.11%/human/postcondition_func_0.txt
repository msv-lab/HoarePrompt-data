The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents the length of the longest subarray in `a` that does not include the first and last elements if they are the same, or the entire array minus one element if all elements are distinct and the first and last elements are different, or the length of the array minus the number of consecutive duplicate elements at the start and end otherwise.
