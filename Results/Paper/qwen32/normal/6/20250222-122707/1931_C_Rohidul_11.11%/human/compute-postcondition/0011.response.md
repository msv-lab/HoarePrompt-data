The variables in the loop head are `l`, `r`, and the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust these variables accordingly.

1. **`l < r`**: This condition must be true for the loop to execute. At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `r` must be at least 1. For `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than 2 (since `l` is 2).

2. **`a[l] == a[l + 1]`**: This condition must also be true. At the end of the previous iteration, `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`, which means `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`. For the loop to execute again, `a[l]` (which is `a[2]` since `l` is 2) must be equal to `a[l + 1]` (which is `a[3]`). Therefore, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the loop head conditions.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be at least 3; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`, and `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 2; `st` is 2; `end` is 0**
