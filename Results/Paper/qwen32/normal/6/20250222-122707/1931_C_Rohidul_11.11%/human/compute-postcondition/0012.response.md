The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `l` is 2, so after the increment, `l` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be at least 3; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`, and `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`; `l` is 3; `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 2; `st` is 2; `end` is 0**
