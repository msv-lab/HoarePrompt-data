To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variables `r` and `l` as they are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition.

The loop condition is:
```
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```
This means the loop will execute if:
1. `r` is greater than `l`.
2. The element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `l` is `n - 1` if all elements are equal, otherwise the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `end` is 0.
- `ans` is determined by initial conditions.
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- If all elements are equal, `l` will be `n - 1`, and `r` is also `n - 1`. In this case, `r > l` is false because `r` is not greater than `l`. Therefore, the loop will not execute.
- If not all elements are equal, `l` will be the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`. For the loop to execute, `r` must be greater than `l` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`. Since `r` is `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `n - 1 > l` and `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`.

To make sure the loop executes, we need to adjust `l` so that `l < r` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`. Given `r` is `n - 1`, we can set `l` to `n - 2` if `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`. If `a[n - 1] != a[n - 2]`, we need to ensure that `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]` by adjusting the array elements, but since we can only adjust `l` and `r`, we need to ensure that `l` is set such that `l < r` and the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `l` is less than `r` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`. Given `r` is `n - 1`, we can set `l` to `n - 2`.

State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 1`, `end` is 0, `ans` is determined by initial conditions, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start**.

However, to ensure `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, we need to clarify that `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`. Since we can't directly adjust the array elements, we assume the array is such that this condition holds.

State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 1`, `end` is 0, `ans` is determined by initial conditions, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start, and `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`**.
