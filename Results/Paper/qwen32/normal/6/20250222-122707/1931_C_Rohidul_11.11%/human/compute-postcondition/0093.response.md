The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. Given the initial state, `end` is initially 2, so after the operation, `end` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `ans`, `st`, and the condition `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `end` is 3, `ans` is determined by initial conditions, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start, `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`**.
