The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `l` and `n - 1` to `r`. The values of `end`, `ans`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `end` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is -1 if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
