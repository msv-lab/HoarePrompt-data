The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `l` is 1, after the increment, `l` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` and `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0**.
