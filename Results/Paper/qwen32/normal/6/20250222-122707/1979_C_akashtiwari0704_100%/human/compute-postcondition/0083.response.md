Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list where each element is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`**

Natural language: The value of `g` has been updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
