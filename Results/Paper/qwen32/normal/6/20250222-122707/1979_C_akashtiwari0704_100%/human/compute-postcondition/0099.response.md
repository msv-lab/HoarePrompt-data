The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `bets - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `bets`.

State: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `bets - 1` is `prod // a[bets - 1]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[bets - 1])`, `i` is `bets`**
