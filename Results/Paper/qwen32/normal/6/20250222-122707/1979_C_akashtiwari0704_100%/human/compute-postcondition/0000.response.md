Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` where 2 <= `k_i` <= 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, while all other conditions and variables remain as specified in the initial state.
