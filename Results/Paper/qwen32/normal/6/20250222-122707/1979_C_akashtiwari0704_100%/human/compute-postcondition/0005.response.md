The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of the list `l`. Since the length of the list `l` does not change during the loop, we only need to adjust the variable `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the index of the last element processed in the list `l`. For the loop to execute another iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `l`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**
