To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change during its execution.

The loop iterates `n - 1` times, comparing each element of the list `num` with the next one. The loop will terminate early if it finds any two consecutive elements that are not equal, setting `f` to 0 and breaking out of the loop. If all elements are equal, `f` will remain 1 after the loop completes.

Given the provided initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state depends on whether all elements in `num` are equal or not:

1. **If all elements in `num` are equal**:
   - The loop will complete all `n - 1` iterations without breaking.
   - `f` will remain 1.
   - `j` will be `n - 2` after the last iteration.
   - `r` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, so it will be `r_initial + (n - 1)`, where `r_initial` is the value of `r` before the loop starts.

2. **If not all elements in `num` are equal**:
   - The loop will break as soon as it finds two consecutive elements that are not equal.
   - `f` will be set to 0.
   - `j` will be the index of the first pair of unequal elements.
   - `r` will be `r_initial + (j + 1)`, where `r_initial` is the value of `r` before the loop starts.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `num`, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the final state of the variables not affected by the loop (like `n`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, and `cn`) will remain unchanged.

### Final Output State
- **If all elements in `num` are equal**:
  Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is the input integer; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is the reversed list of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `r` is the initial value of `r` plus `n - 1`.**

- **If not all elements in `num` are equal**:
  Output State: **`f` is 0; `n` is the input integer; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is the reversed list of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the index of the first pair of unequal elements plus 1.**

Since the problem does not specify the exact input list `num`, we cannot determine with certainty whether all elements are equal or not. However, the format for the final output state is provided as follows:

Output State: **`f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `n` is the input integer; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is the reversed list of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop.**
