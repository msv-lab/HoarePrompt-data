To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Let's break down the provided state and the loop:

- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `f` is 1
  - `n` is 2 (or greater)
  - `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`
  - `symb1` is the first element of `num`
  - `symb2` is the last element of `num`
  - If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2; otherwise, `cn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
  - `ck` remains 1 in both cases.

- **Loop statement:**
  ```
  for i in range(n - 1):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

In the loop, `i` is the loop variable and `n` is the upper limit of the loop range. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

**At the end of the previous iteration:**
- `i` was some value, and the loop is about to start the next iteration.
- Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` again to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

**Adjustments:**
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the loop's upper limit.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `f` remains 1 (unchanged).
- `n` remains 2 (or greater) (unchanged).
- `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`, and `ck` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`f` is 1; `n` is 2 (or greater); `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Given that `i` was 0 in the first iteration (as it starts from 0 in `range(n - 1)`), after the first iteration, `i` would be 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

State: **`f` is 1; `n` is 2 (or greater); `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `i` is 1**.
