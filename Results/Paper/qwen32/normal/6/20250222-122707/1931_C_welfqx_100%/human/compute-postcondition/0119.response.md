The code snippet provided increments the variable `ck` by 1. Since the initial state does not mention the value of `ck`, we can only infer that `ck` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is greater than 5; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ii` is 5; `ck` is incremented by 1**.
