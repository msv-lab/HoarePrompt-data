To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind the variables `ck`, `cn`, and `n`.

### Initial State:
1. **`ck`**: This is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` up to `onum[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found.
2. **`cn`**: This variable is updated based on the value of `symb1` and `symb2`. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the previous value of `cn` plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged.
3. **`n`**: This is the length of the list `onum`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - max(cn, ck))
```

### Explanation:
- **`max(cn, ck)`**: This function returns the maximum value between `cn` and `ck`.
- **`n - max(cn, ck)`**: This expression calculates the difference between the length of the list `onum` and the maximum value between `cn` and `ck`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `ck`**: 
   - `ck` counts the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `onum` until either the list ends or an inequality is found.
   
2. **Determine `cn`**: 
   - `cn` is updated only if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`. If they are equal, `cn` is incremented by the value of `ck` from the previous iteration. If they are not equal, `cn` remains the same as the previous value.
   
3. **Calculate `max(cn, ck)`**: 
   - This will be the larger of the two values, `cn` and `ck`.
   
4. **Calculate `n - max(cn, ck)`**: 
   - This is the final value that will be printed. It represents the length of the list `onum` minus the maximum count of consecutive equal elements found during the process.

### Output:
Given the information, the output of the print statement will be the length of the list `onum` minus the maximum count of consecutive equal elements found (`cn` or `ck`).

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where n is the length of the list `onum`, cn is the updated count based on consecutive equal elements, and ck is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element)**
