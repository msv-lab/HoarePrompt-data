The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means the variable `n` is assigned the integer value of the user's input. None of the other variables (`ck`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`, `r`) are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` up to `onum[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the previous value of `cn` plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged, `r` is the current value of `r` plus 1; `n` is an input integer.**
