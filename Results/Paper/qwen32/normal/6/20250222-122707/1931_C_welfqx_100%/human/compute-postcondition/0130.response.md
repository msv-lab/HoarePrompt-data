The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `num`. This means that the initial values of `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `cn` will be updated based on the new list `num`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `num` is reassigned to the list of integers from the input.
- `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, so it will be updated to the reversed version of the new `num`.
- `symb1` is the first element of `num`, so it will be updated to the first element of the new `num`.
- `symb2` is the last element of `num`, so it will be updated to the last element of the new `num`.
- `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, so it will be recalculated based on the new `num`.
- `r` is not affected by this line of code.
- `f`, `n`, `ck` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is the reversed list of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
