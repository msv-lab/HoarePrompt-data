To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and its conditions. The loop iterates over the range `n-1` and checks if consecutive elements in the list `num` are equal. If they are equal, `cn` is incremented; otherwise, the loop breaks.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **After 1 iteration**: The loop checks if `num[0] == num[1]`. If true, `cn` becomes 2; otherwise, the loop breaks.
2. **After 2 iterations**: The loop checks if `num[1] == num[2]`. If true, `cn` becomes 3; otherwise, the loop breaks.
3. **After 3 iterations**: The loop checks if `num[2] == num[3]`. If true, `cn` becomes 4; otherwise, the loop breaks.

The loop will continue to iterate and increment `cn` as long as consecutive elements are equal. The loop will break if at any point `num[i] != num[i + 1]`.

The loop runs `n-1` times, so the maximum number of iterations is `n-1`. The final state of `cn` will be the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the list `num` has at least 4 consecutive equal elements (since the loop executed 3 times). Therefore, the loop will continue to iterate until it finds a pair of consecutive elements that are not equal or until it completes all `n-1` iterations.

If `num` has `k` consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, then `cn` will be `k` after the loop completes. If `num` has fewer than `n-1` consecutive equal elements, the loop will break early, and `cn` will be the number of consecutive equal elements found.

Since the problem does not specify the exact contents of `num`, we can only provide a general output state based on the loop's behavior:

- `f` remains 1.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `num` remains the list of integers from the input.
- `onum` remains the reversed copy of `num`.
- `symb1` remains the first element of `num`.
- `symb2` remains the last element of `num`.
- `ck` remains 1.
- `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop.
- `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.

Assuming `num` has `n-1` consecutive equal elements, the loop will complete all `n-1` iterations, and `cn` will be `n`.

Therefore, the output state after all executions of the loop is:

Output State: **f is 1; n is the input integer; num is a list of integers from the input; onum is a reversed copy of num; symb1 is the first element of num; symb2 is the last element of num; ck is 1; cn is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num; r is the initial value of r plus (n - 1).**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `f`, `n`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `ck` remain unchanged. The variable `cn` will be the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, and `r` will be incremented by the number of iterations completed by the loop.
