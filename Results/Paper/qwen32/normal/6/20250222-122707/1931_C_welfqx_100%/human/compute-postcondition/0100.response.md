The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of the variable `cn` by 1. However, the initial state does not mention the variable `cn`, so we assume it was defined and had some value before this code snippet was executed. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `cn`, we can only state that `cn` is now one more than its previous value. All other variables (`f`, `n`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is 2 (or greater); `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `i` is 1; `cn` is increased by 1.**
