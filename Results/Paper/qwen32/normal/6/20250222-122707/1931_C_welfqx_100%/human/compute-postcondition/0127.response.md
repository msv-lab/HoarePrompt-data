The only variable in the loop head is `r`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `r` and the range `t`. If `r` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` has not been specified directly, but we know it must have taken on a value that allowed the loop to execute up to that point. For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `t`.

State: **`f` is 1; `n` is the same; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is `n`; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is increased by `n`; `r` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`**.

To be more precise in the state representation:
State: **`f` is 1; `n` is the same; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is `n`; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is increased by `n`; `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.
