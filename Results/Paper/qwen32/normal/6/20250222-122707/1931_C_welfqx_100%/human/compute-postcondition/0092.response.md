The code assigns the first element of `onum` to the variable `symb2`. Given that `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb2` will be the last element of `num`. The other variables (`f`, `n`, `cn`, `ck`, and `symb1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is either 1 or `f` is 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`.**
