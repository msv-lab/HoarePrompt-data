Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `f` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is the reversed list of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`; `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `f` is 0 if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, otherwise `f` remains 1. `n` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is the reversed list of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `j` is 0. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `f` is 0 if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged. `n` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is the reversed list of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `j` is 1. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `f` is 0 if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged. `n` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is the reversed list of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `j` is 2. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
