Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. The logic implemented does not account for the optimal way to use the allowed operation to make all elements of the array equal with the least cost. The program only checks for consecutive elements that are the same and calculates the cost based on the longest sequence of identical elements from the start or the end of the array, but it does not consider more complex scenarios where a single operation might be used to make the entire array equal more efficiently.

For example, consider the test case:

```
5
1 3 3 3 1
```

The program would output `3` because it might calculate the longest sequence of identical elements as `3` (from the second to the fourth position) and then subtract this from `n` (which is `5`), resulting in `2`. However, the correct answer should be `1` because you can choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 3` (or `x = 1`), which would make the entire array equal to `3` (or `1`) with a cost of `5 - 1 + 1 = 5`, but since we can only use the operation once, the optimal solution is to choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 3` (or `x = 1`) with a cost of `5 - 4 + 1 = 2` (or `5 - 4 + 1 = 2`), but the optimal solution is actually `1` by choosing `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 3` (or `x = 1`).

Thus, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
