The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no variables being modified in the given code snippet, the values of `f` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1 if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `n` is either 1 or `f` is 1.**
