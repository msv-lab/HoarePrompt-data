Output State: **`temp` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. `n`, `m`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged. `ans` is now equal to `temp`. `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is a string value returned by `func_1().split()`.**

In simple terms, the set `temp` remains the same, and `ans` is now equal to `temp`. The variable `r` has been converted to an integer from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` holds the second value returned by `func_1().split()` as a string. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
