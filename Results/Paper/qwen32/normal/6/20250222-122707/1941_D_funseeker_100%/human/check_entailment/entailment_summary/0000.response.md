### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a line of input from the standard input and returns it after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to read input values.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the first line of input using `func_1` and converts it to an integer. This integer represents the number of test cases (`t`). This is consistent with the problem's requirement to read the number of test cases.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads a line of input using `func_1`, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to read the number of players, number of throws, and the starting player.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function performs the core logic of the problem. For each test case, it:
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` based on the direction of the throw (`c`):
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the set `ans`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to the set `ans`.
   - If the set `ans` contains `0`, it removes `0` and adds `n` instead, ensuring that player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and their numbers in increasing order.

### Verification:

- The function `func_4` correctly handles the logic for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, as well as the unknown direction case (`?`).
- The modulo operation ensures that the player numbers wrap around correctly within the circle.
- The final handling of `0` ensures that player numbers are correctly represented in the range `[1, n]`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
