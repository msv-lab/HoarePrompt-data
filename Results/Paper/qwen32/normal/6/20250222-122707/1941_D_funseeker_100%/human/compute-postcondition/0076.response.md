To determine the output of the `print(len(ans))` statement, we need to understand the transformation applied to the `ans` set based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ans` Set**: This set initially contains unique values computed from the expressions `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` set, based on the `c` values from each iteration.
2. **Exclusions and Modifications**:
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it is excluded, and `n` is added to the set.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, the set remains unchanged.
3. **Variables**:
   - `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged.
   - `c` is the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.

### Calculation of `len(ans)`:
Given the transformations described, the length of `ans` will depend on whether `0` was in the set before the transformation:
- **If `0` was in `ans`**:
  - `0` is removed.
  - `n` is added.
  - The length of `ans` remains the same because one element is removed and another is added.
- **If `0` was not in `ans`**:
  - The set remains unchanged.
  - The length of `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the length of `ans` after the transformation is the same as its length before the transformation.

### Conclusion:
Since the transformation does not change the number of elements in the set `ans`, the length of `ans` remains the same.

### Output:
Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set `ans` after the transformation)**

However, without knowing the exact initial state of `ans`, we can't provide a specific numerical value. The most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set `ans` after the transformation)**
