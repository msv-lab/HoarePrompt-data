Postcondition: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, plus the element `(q + r) % n`. `ans` is `{b, c}`, and `q` is `b`. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set.**
