To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the `temp` set is populated based on the value of `c` and the elements in `ans`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `temp` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is an empty set.
   - `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `n`, `m`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `q` in `ans`.
   - For each `q`, depending on the value of `c`, the following operations are performed:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.

3. **Output State after Each Iteration**:
   - **1st Iteration**: 
     - If `c` is '1', `temp` contains `(q - r) % n`.
     - If `c` is '?', `temp` contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
     - If `c` is '0', `temp` remains empty.
   - **2nd Iteration**: 
     - Similar to the 1st iteration, but for the next element `q` in `ans`.
   - **3rd Iteration**: 
     - Similar to the 1st iteration, but for the next element `q` in `ans`.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - After all iterations, `temp` will contain all the computed values based on the elements in `ans` and the value of `c`.
   - If `c` is '0', `temp` will remain empty because no elements are added.
   - If `c` is '1', `temp` will contain `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.
   - If `c` is '?', `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.

Given these points, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `temp` will contain all the computed values based on the elements in `ans` and the value of `c`.
- `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`.

Output State: **`temp` contains `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the value of `c`. `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged.**
