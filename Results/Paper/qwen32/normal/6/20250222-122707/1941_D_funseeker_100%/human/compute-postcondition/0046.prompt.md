Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `ans` is an empty set, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`. `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x`. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, plus the element `(q + r) % n`. `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x`, and `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that has not been processed yet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, plus the element `(q + r) % n`. `ans` is `{b, c}`, and `q` is `b`. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
