The code adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp` for each `q` in `x`. The variable `ans` is not affected by this line of code. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. The set `temp` now contains all the previously computed values plus the new values from `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x`.**
