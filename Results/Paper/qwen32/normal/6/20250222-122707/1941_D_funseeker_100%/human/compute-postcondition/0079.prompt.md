You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= n. r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and c is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` is a set of all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` set, based on the `c` values from each iteration; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged; `c` is the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `ans` is a set of all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` set, based on the `c` values from each iteration. If `0` was in `ans`, it is excluded and `n` is added to the set. If `0` was not in `ans`, the set remains unchanged. `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged; `c` is the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set `ans` after the transformation)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted unique values of the `ans` set, where `ans` is computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the `ans` set, and if `0` was in the set, it is excluded, and `n` is added
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_4` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c`. Here, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `r` is an integer between 1 and `n - 1`, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
