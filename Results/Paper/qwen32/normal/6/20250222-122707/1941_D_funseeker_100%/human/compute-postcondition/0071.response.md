To understand the final state of the loop, let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is the first return value of `func_3()`.
   - `m` is the second return value of `func_3()`.
   - `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`.
   - `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1.
   - `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.
   - `ans` is initialized to `x`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `m` times.
   - In each iteration, `r` and `c` are updated from `func_1().split()`.
   - `temp` is a set that accumulates results of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, based on the value of `c`.
   - `ans` is updated to `temp` at the end of each iteration.

3. **Output State after All Iterations**:
   - After `m` iterations, `ans` will contain all unique values computed from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` set, based on the values of `r` and `c` from each iteration.
   - `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `c` will be the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.

In natural language, the final output state is that `ans` will be a set of all unique values computed by adding or subtracting the `r` values (from each iteration) to/from the elements of `ans` (from the previous iteration), modulo `n`, based on the `c` values ('0', '1', or '?') from each iteration. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and the final `r`) remain the same as they were initially, except `c` which will be the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.

Output State: **`ans` is a set of all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` set, based on the `c` values from each iteration; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged; `c` is the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.**
