The code snippet reassigns `temp` to be an empty set. This change affects the value of `temp` but does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `c`, `ans`, or `r`. Since `ans` was previously set to the value of `temp`, `ans` is also now an empty set.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty set; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged; `ans` is an empty set; `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`.**
