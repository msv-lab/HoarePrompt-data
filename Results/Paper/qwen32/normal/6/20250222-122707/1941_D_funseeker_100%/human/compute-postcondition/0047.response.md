Output State: **`temp` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. `ans` is now equal to `temp`.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` is now equal to the set `temp`, which contains all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.
