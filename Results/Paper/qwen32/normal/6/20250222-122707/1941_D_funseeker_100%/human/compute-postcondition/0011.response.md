The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. Given that `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` initially contains the element `(q + r) % n`. After executing the code, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and can be either '0' or '?', `ans` is `x`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**

In simpler terms, the set `temp` now includes two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
