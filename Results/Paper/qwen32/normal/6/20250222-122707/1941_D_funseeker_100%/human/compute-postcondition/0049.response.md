The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1().split()` to `r` and `c`. This means that `func_1()` is called, and its return value is expected to be a string that, when split, provides two values. The first value from the split result is assigned to `r`, and the second value is assigned to `c`.

Since the initial state does not specify the return value of `func_1()`, we can only describe the output state in terms of the new values assigned to `r` and `c`.

Output State: **`temp` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. `n`, `m`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged. `ans` is now equal to `temp`. `r` and `c` are assigned the values returned by `func_1().split()`.**
