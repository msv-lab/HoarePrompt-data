You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
    vprod = [den // r for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input. It calculates a cumulative value `den` by applying a function `func_1` cumulatively to the elements of `vals`. It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `den` by each element in `vals`. The function subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If the resulting `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute bets on `n` outcomes such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- Each outcome has a multiplier `k_i`.
- If the `i-th` outcome wins, you receive `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the bet on that outcome.
- The total bet `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n` must be strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following steps:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers stored in `den`.
   - It then computes `vprod` as a list where each element is `den // r` for each multiplier `r` in `vals`.
   - It calculates `den` as `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod` as the bets.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the program is correct by checking if the conditions are met.

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
- **Bets Calculation**: The values in `vprod` are calculated as `den // k_i`. This ensures that `k_i * vprod[i] = den` for each `i`.
- **Total Bet Calculation**: The total bet is `sum(vprod)`, which is equal to `den - den = 0` initially, but since `den` is the LCM, `sum(vprod)` is less than `den` because `den` is subtracted by `sum(vprod)`.
- **Condition Check**: The condition `den <= 0` checks if the total bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome. If `den` is positive, it means the total bet is less than `den`, and `den` is equal to `k_i * vprod[i]` for each `i`.

However, there is a flaw in the program. The program calculates `den` as `den - sum(vprod)`, which should be a positive value for the solution to be valid. If `den` becomes non-positive, it incorrectly concludes that no valid distribution is possible. But the correct condition should ensure that `sum(vprod) < den / k_i` for each `i`.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly handle the condition that the total bet should be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The program incorrectly calculates the total bet and the condition check is flawed.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
