### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Summary:**
- We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that if any one of the outcomes wins, the amount received (multiplied by the respective multiplier `k_i`) is strictly greater than the total amount bet.
- If no such distribution is possible, we should return `-1`.

**Code Analysis:**

The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's what each function does:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - This is used to find a common denominator for the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - Computes a cumulative LCM of all the multipliers in `vals` and stores it in `den`.
   - Computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`. This essentially divides the common denominator by each multiplier.
   - It then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`.
   - If the resulting `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`, which represent the bets on each outcome.

**Correctness Analysis:**

Let's verify if the logic in `func_2()` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome:

- The LCM (`den`) ensures that every multiplier `k_i` divides `den`. This means that for each outcome, `den // k_i` is an integer.
- The list `vprod` represents the bets on each outcome. The sum of these bets is `den - den = 0` if the calculation in the code is correct.
- However, the code actually computes `den` as the LCM and then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from it. If `den` is greater than the sum of `vprod`, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Let's consider the logic of the bets:
- For each outcome `i`, the bet `vprod[i]` is `den // k_i`.
- The total bet is the sum of `vprod`, which is `den - den = 0` if the code logic holds.
- The received amount for any winning outcome `i` is `k_i * vprod[i] = k_i * (den // k_i) = den`.

Since `den` is the LCM of all `k_i`, it is the smallest number that is divisible by all `k_i`. Therefore, `den` is greater than the sum of `vprod` if there is a valid distribution, ensuring that the received amount for any winning outcome is strictly greater than the total bet.

Thus, the logic in the code correctly determines if a valid distribution exists and outputs the bets if it does.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
