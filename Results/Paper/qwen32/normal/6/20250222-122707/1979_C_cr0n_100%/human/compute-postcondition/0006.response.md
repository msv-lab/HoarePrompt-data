Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `den` is the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the next element in `vals` after the first iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`. The other variables, `N`, `vals`, and `x`, remain unchanged.
