You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, and vals is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome, where 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each k_i in vals.
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, vals is a list of integers, and den is the value returned by applying func_1 cumulatively to all elements in vals starting with den = vals[0].
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers, `den` is the value returned by applying `func_1` cumulatively to all elements in `vals` starting with `den = vals[0]` minus the sum of `vprod`, and `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`. Additionally, `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: den // vals[0] den // vals[1] den // vals[2] ... den // vals[N-1] (where den is the cumulative result of applying func_1 to all elements in vals starting with den = vals[0] and then subtracting the sum of vprod, and vprod is a list of den // r for each r in vals)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `N`, an integer representing the number of outcomes, and `vals`, a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome, where 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each k_i in vals. The function returns nothing.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
