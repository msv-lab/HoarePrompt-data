Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `k` remains 0 if it was 0 initially. `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if `a[l]` was originally equal to 0, otherwise `a[l]` retains its original value. Each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 (except `a[l]` which may be 0). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `l` retains its original value. `r` retains its original value. `sunks` is incremented by 1. `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `k` was not 0, no changes are made to `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, or `sunks` except for the potential increment to `sunks`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sunks` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their original values.
