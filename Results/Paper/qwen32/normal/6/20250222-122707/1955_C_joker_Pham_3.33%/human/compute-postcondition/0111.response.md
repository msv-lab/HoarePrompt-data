The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `l`, `r`, or `sunks`. It only terminates the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. Since there is no change in the values of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the indication that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
