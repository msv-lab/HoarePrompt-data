The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Other variables (`n`, `l`, `k`, `a[r]`, `a[l]`, and `sunks`) are not directly affected by this statement. Therefore, the value of `r` is reduced by 1, while the conditions and values of other variables remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r` - 1. If `l` equals `r` - 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r - 1]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sunks`. `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`. `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`. `sunks` is incremented by 1. `r` is `r - 1`.**
