Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2` and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`. `l` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is increased by 1. All other variables (`n`, `r`, `sunks`, `k`, and the elements of `a`) maintain their previously described states and values.
