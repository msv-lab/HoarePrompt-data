Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` remains an integer within the specified range, and the relationship between `l` and `r` (where `l` is less than or equal to `r`) is preserved. The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
