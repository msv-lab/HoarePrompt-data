Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` >= `a[l] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `l` is incremented by 1. If `k` < `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
