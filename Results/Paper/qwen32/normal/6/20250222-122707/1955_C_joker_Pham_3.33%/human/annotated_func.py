    return sunks
    #The program returns the count of fully sunk elements, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list `a`, an integer `k` representing a threshold value, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes the list `a` to determine how many elements can be "fully sunk" based on the threshold `k`. An element is considered "fully sunk" if it can be reduced to zero by subtracting twice its value (or a value close to it) from `k`, along with possibly reducing other elements. The function returns the count of such fully sunk elements.
