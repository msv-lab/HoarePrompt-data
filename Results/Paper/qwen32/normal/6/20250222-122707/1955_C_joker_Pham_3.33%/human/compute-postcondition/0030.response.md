Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` and `r` are integers, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is set to 2 if `l` equals `r`, otherwise `sunks` is set to 1. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` does not equal `k`, `sunks` is set to 1 if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, otherwise `sunks` remains 0. In all cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l` is not equal to `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
