The value of `r` is decremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `sunks` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is `k - 2 * a[l]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if it was originally equal to 0, otherwise it retains its original value, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`; `l` retains its original value; `r` is `r - 1`; `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
