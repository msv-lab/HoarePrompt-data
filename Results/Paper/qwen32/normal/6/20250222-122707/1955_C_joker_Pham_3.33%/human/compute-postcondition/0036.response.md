Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` remains 0 if it was 0 initially, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers, and `sunks` remains 0 if `k` was 0 initially, otherwise `sunks` retains its original value. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`.**
