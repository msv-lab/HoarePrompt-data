Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`; `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`; `a[r]`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values. If `a[l]` is 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. `sunks` is incremented by 1; `r` is decreased by 1. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `a[r]`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still decreased by `a[r] * 2`, and `a[l]` is still decreased by `a[r]`. If `a[l]` becomes 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1. The loop continues to the next iteration without any further changes to the variables unless the loop condition is met again.
