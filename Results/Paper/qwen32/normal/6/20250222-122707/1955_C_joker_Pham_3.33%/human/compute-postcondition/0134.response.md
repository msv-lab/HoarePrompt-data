Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`; `k`, which is an integer representing a threshold value; and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers. The function returns the count of elements in the list `a` that are fully sunk, where an element is considered fully sunk if it meets a certain condition related to the threshold `k`.**
