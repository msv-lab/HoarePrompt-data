The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
