The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. This change affects the value of `l` directly. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `sunks`) remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 and `k` has been decreased by `a[l] * 2`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- `l` and `r` are integers, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`
- Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`
- If `a[r]` is 0, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1
- If `a[r]` is not 0, then `a[r]` remains `a[r] - a[l]`
- `sunks` is incremented by 1

After executing `l += 1`, the value of `l` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `l` is `l + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 and `k` has been decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is an integer, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1**
