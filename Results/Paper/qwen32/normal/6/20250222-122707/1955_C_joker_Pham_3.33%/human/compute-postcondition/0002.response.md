The `while` loop condition is `l <= r`. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the condition must be true right before the loop starts. Given the initial states:

- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Initially, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `n - 1` will always be at least 0 when `n` is at least 1. Therefore, the condition `l <= r` will always be true for valid values of `n`.

No adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `r` because the condition `l <= r` is inherently satisfied given the constraints on `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0**
