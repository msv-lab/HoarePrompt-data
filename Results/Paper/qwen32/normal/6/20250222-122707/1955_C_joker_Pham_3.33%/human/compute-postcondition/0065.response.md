The code snippet `a[r] -= a[l]` modifies the value of `a[r]` by subtracting the value of `a[l]` from it. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` are provided in the initial state, but only `a[r]` is directly affected by this operation. 

The value of `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`. The values of `a[l]`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged unless the condition for `sunks` to increment is met, which is not specified in the given snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is `k - 2 * a[l]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if it was originally equal to 0, otherwise it retains its original value, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`; `l` retains its original value; `r` retains its original value; `sunks` remains unchanged unless the condition for its increment is met.**
