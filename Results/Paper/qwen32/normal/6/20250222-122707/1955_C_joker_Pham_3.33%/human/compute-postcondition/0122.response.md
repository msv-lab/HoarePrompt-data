Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1. `k` and `a[r]` remain unchanged. `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` and `sunks` are updated accordingly, while `k` and `a[r]` stay the same. If `a[l]` is not 0, `l` and `sunks` remain unchanged, but `a[l]` is still updated to `a[l] - a[r]`.
