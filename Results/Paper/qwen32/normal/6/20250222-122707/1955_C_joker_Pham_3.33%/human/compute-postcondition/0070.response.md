Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is `k - 2 * a[l]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if it was originally equal to 0, otherwise it retains its original value, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`; `l` is `l + 1`; if `a[r]` was 0, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1, otherwise `r` retains its original value and `sunks` remains unchanged; `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values or states as described in the initial state, except for `l` which has been updated.
