Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`; `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`; `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values; `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sunks` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their original values and conditions.
