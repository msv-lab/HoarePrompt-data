Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The game described can be analyzed using the concept of winning and losing positions in combinatorial game theory. Here's the key insight:

- If both players have the same number of coins, the first player (Alice) can always mirror the moves of the second player (Bob) and force Bob into a losing position. Hence, Bob wins when `a == b`.
- If Alice starts with 1 coin, she cannot make any meaningful move and will lose regardless of Bob's actions. Hence, Alice wins when `a == 1` and `b > 1`.
- If Bob starts with 1 coin, he can always force Alice into a losing position by not swapping until Alice is forced to take the last coin. Hence, Bob wins when `b == 1` and `a > 1`.
- If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making sure that after her turn, the number of coins in both wallets are even. Hence, Bob wins when `a` is odd.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by making sure that after his turn, the number of coins in both wallets are odd. Hence, Alice wins when `a` is even and `b` is odd.
- If `a` is even and `b` is even, the player who starts (Alice) can always mirror the moves of the other player and force the other player into a losing position. Hence, Bob wins when both `a` and `b` are even and `a > b`.
- If `a` is even and `b` is even, and `a < b`, then Bob can always mirror the moves of Alice and force Alice into a losing position. Hence, Alice wins when both `a` and `b` are even and `a < b`.

However, the provided program does not fully capture all these nuances and contains incorrect logic. Specifically, the conditions:
- `elif a > b: print('Bob')`
- `else: print('Alice')`

are incorrect because they do not consider the parity of `a` and `b` when both are even.

Let's correct the logic:

- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a == 1`, Alice wins.
- If `b == 1`, Bob wins.
- If `a` is odd, Bob wins.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice wins.
- If both `a` and `b` are even, the player who starts (Alice) can always mirror the moves of the other player and force the other player into a losing position. Hence, the player with the smaller number of coins loses. If `a < b`, Alice wins; if `a > b`, Bob wins.

The correct logic should be:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a < b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

Given the above analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the cases where both `a` and `b` are even.

Correctness: **False**
