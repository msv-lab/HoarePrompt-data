The provided initial state includes several variables: `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement will simply output the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Bob**
