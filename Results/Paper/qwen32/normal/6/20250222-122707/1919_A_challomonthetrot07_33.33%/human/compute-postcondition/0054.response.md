Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is odd, the specific actions within the if block are performed. Otherwise, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`, `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` retain their values as described, with `i` incremented by 1.**
