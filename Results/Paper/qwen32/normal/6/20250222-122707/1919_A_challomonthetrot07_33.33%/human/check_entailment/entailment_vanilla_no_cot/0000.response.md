To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic used to determine the winner based on the given problem description.

The game rules and the optimal play strategy are as follows:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
- Each player must take one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

The key insight to solve this problem is to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets:
- If both wallets have the same number of coins (`a == b`), the second player (Bob) wins because the first player (Alice) will always be forced into a losing position.
- If Alice has exactly one coin (`a == 1`), she will lose because she has to take one coin, leaving both wallets empty, and Bob wins.
- If Bob has exactly one coin (`b == 1`), Alice can swap and force Bob into the position of having one coin, so Alice wins.
- If Alice has an odd number of coins (`a % 2 == 1`), she can always force Bob into a position where he has an even number of coins, and Bob will eventually lose.
- If Alice has an even number of coins (`a % 2 == 0`) and Bob has an odd number of coins (`b % 2 == 1`), Alice can force Bob into a losing position.
- If Alice has more coins than Bob (`a > b`), and neither of the previous conditions are met, Bob can force Alice into a losing position.
- Otherwise, Alice can force Bob into a losing position.

Let's review the given code:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

The code logic does not match the optimal strategy described above:
- The condition `elif a == 1: print('Alice')` is incorrect. If `a == 1`, Alice will lose, so it should be `print('Bob')`.
- The condition `elif b == 1: print('Bob')` is incorrect. If `b == 1`, Bob will lose, so it should be `print('Alice')`.
- The condition `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Bob')` is incorrect. If `a % 2 == 1`, Alice can force Bob into a losing position, so it should be `print('Alice')`.
- The condition `elif a > b: print('Bob')` is incorrect. If `a > b` and neither of the previous conditions are met, Bob can force Alice into a losing position, but this condition should be placed after checking other conditions.

Given the incorrect logic, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
