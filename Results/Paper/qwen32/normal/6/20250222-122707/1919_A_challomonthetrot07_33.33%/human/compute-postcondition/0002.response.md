The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The value of `T`, which represents the number of test cases, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
