You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

    T = int(input())

    #State: The loop has executed `T` times, with `i` equal to `T`. The values of `a` and `b` reflect the last test case processed. The variable `T` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It determines the winner based on specific conditions and prints either "Alice", "Bob", or implicitly "Bob" in cases not explicitly covered by the conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The game described can be analyzed using the concept of winning and losing positions in combinatorial game theory. Here's the key insight:

- If both players have the same number of coins, the first player (Alice) can always mirror the moves of the second player (Bob) and force Bob into a losing position. Hence, Bob wins when `a == b`.
- If Alice starts with 1 coin, she cannot make any meaningful move and will lose regardless of Bob's actions. Hence, Alice wins when `a == 1` and `b > 1`.
- If Bob starts with 1 coin, he can always force Alice into a losing position by not swapping until Alice is forced to take the last coin. Hence, Bob wins when `b == 1` and `a > 1`.
- If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making sure that after her turn, the number of coins in both wallets are even. Hence, Bob wins when `a` is odd.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by making sure that after his turn, the number of coins in both wallets are odd. Hence, Alice wins when `a` is even and `b` is odd.
- If `a` is even and `b` is even, the player who starts (Alice) can always mirror the moves of the other player and force the other player into a losing position. Hence, Bob wins when both `a` and `b` are even and `a > b`.
- If `a` is even and `b` is even, and `a < b`, then Bob can always mirror the moves of Alice and force Alice into a losing position. Hence, Alice wins when both `a` and `b` are even and `a < b`.

However, the provided program does not fully capture all these nuances and contains incorrect logic. Specifically, the conditions:
- `elif a > b: print('Bob')`
- `else: print('Alice')`

are incorrect because they do not consider the parity of `a` and `b` when both are even.

Let's correct the logic:

- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a == 1`, Alice wins.
- If `b == 1`, Bob wins.
- If `a` is odd, Bob wins.
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice wins.
- If both `a` and `b` are even, the player who starts (Alice) can always mirror the moves of the other player and force the other player into a losing position. Hence, the player with the smaller number of coins loses. If `a < b`, Alice wins; if `a > b`, Bob wins.

The correct logic should be:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a < b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

Given the above analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the cases where both `a` and `b` are even.

Correctness: **False**
