Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` was originally 1, its value remains 1. Otherwise, `a` retains its value and its parity (odd or even) remains unchanged. If `b` was originally 1, its value remains 1. Otherwise, `b` retains its value and its parity remains unchanged. Additionally, if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` remains greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
