Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- The current value of `b` is set to 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Bob'`. The values of `T`, `a`, and `b` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because the statement is hardcoded to print the string `'Bob'`.

### Output:
Output: **Bob**
