The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `T`. If `i` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus one.

Given that `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, and `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `T`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus one.** 

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
