You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5
    
    11 9
    
    83 91
    
    1032 9307
    
    839204 7281
    
    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It determines the winner based on specific conditions and prints either "Alice", "Bob", or implicitly "Bob" in cases not explicitly covered by the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis:
The program is supposed to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets and optimal play. Here's the provided code:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or not.
- A player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **Equal Coins (a == b):** If both have the same number of coins, Bob wins because Alice will always be the one to make the last move.
2. **Alice has 1 coin (a == 1):** Alice will lose because she can only remove the coin and then Bob wins.
3. **Bob has 1 coin (b == 1):** Bob will lose because he can only remove the coin and then Alice wins.
4. **Odd Coins (a % 2 == 1):** If Alice has an odd number of coins, Bob wins because Alice can only leave an even number of coins for Bob, and Bob can always mirror Alice's moves.
5. **Even and Odd Coins (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1):** If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice wins because she can force Bob into an odd number of coins, and Bob will eventually lose.
6. **More Coins (a > b):** If Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob wins because Alice can always mirror Bob's moves or force Bob into a losing position.
7. **Fewer Coins (else):** If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, Alice wins because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves or force Alice into a losing position.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with some edge cases and see if it works as expected:

1. **Test Case 1: a = 1, b = 1**
   - Expected Output: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

2. **Test Case 2: a = 1, b = 4**
   - Expected Output: Alice
   - Program Output: Alice

3. **Test Case 3: a = 5, b = 3**
   - Expected Output: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

4. **Test Case 4: a = 4, b = 5**
   - Expected Output: Alice
   - Program Output: Alice

5. **Test Case 5: a = 11, b = 9**
   - Expected Output: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

6. **Test Case 6: a = 83, b = 91**
   - Expected Output: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

7. **Test Case 7: a = 1032, b = 9307**
   - Expected Output: Alice
   - Program Output: Alice

8. **Test Case 8: a = 839204, b = 7281**
   - Expected Output: Alice
   - Program Output: Alice

9. **Test Case 9: a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000**
   - Expected Output: Bob
   - Program Output: Bob

10. **Test Case 10: a = 53110, b = 2024**
    - Expected Output: Bob
    - Program Output: Bob

### Conclusion:
After testing the program with various cases, it seems to correctly determine the winner based on the given rules and examples. The logic in the code appears to cover all the necessary edge cases and scenarios mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all the given scenarios and edge cases as per the problem description. It considers the number of coins in both wallets, whether they are equal, whether one of them is 1, and whether the number of coins is odd or even. The logic ensures that the optimal moves are considered for both players.
