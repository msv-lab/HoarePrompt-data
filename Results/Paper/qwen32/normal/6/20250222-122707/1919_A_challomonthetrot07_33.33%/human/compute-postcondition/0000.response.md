Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000. The function receives two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) for each test case, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.**

Natural Language: The variable `T` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The conditions for the integers `a` and `b` for each test case remain unchanged.
