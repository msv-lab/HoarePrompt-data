The given code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Bob'. The initial state provides information about the variables `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Information**:
   - `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('Bob')` statement is executed.
   - This statement simply outputs the string 'Bob' to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Bob**
