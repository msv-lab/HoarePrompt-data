### Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, but it does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Let's analyze the logic in the code:

1. **Case 1:** `if a == b: print('Bob')` - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same, the code correctly states that Bob wins. This is because, in this scenario, Alice will always be the one to make the last move, leading to her inability to make a move when both wallets are empty.
   
2. **Case 2:** `elif a == 1: print('Alice')` - If Alice has only one coin, she can swap with Bob and then remove her coin, forcing Bob to face the same situation, leading to Bob's loss. This is correct.
   
3. **Case 3:** `elif b == 1: print('Bob')` - If Bob has only one coin, Alice can remove her coin first, then Bob will be left with one coin and will lose. This is correct.
   
4. **Case 4:** `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Bob')` - If the number of coins Alice has is odd, the code states that Bob wins. However, this is not always correct. The winner depends on the parity of both `a` and `b`. For example, if both `a` and `b` are odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
   
5. **Case 5:** `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1: print('Alice')` - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, the code states that Alice wins. This is not always correct. The strategy depends on the specific values of `a` and `b` and not just their parity.
   
6. **Case 6:** `elif a > b: print('Bob')` - If `a` is greater than `b`, the code states that Bob wins. This is not always correct. The winner depends on the optimal strategy, not just the relative number of coins.
   
7. **Case 7:** `else: print('Alice')` - If none of the above conditions are met, the code defaults to Alice winning. This is also not always correct.

The correct strategy involves a more nuanced analysis of the game state. Specifically, the game can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers or Nimbers from combinatorial game theory. However, a simpler approach involves recognizing that if both `a` and `b` are even, Alice can always force a win by mirroring Bob's moves. If both are odd, Bob can force a win by mirroring Alice's moves. If one is even and the other is odd, the player with the even number of coins can force a win.

### Correctness:
Given the incorrect handling of the game's logic based on the parity and relative values of `a` and `b`, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
