Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element with at least 2 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `False` if the current element `nums[i]` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `cw` remains `True` and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**
