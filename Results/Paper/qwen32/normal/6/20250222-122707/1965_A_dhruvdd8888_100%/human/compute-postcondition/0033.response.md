Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element with at least 2 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is the same as `cw`, `cw` is `not nw` if `nums[i]` is 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`, and `i` is `i - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `nw` is updated to be the same as `cw`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
