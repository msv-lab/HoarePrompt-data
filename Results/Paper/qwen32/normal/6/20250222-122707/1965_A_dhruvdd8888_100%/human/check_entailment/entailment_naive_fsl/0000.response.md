Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Random Function Call**: The line `rrr = randint(8888, 88888)` does not serve any purpose in the context of the problem and can be removed.

2. **Function `func_1` Call**: The function `func_1` is called inside a loop, but it is not defined before its usage. Additionally, the function `func_1` is supposed to handle the logic for each test case, but it is not correctly structured to do so.

3. **Handling Input**: The input is read and processed incorrectly. The line `nums = set(input().split())` reads the input as a set of strings, which is not suitable for further numerical operations. The set also removes duplicate values, which is incorrect for this problem since the number of stones in each pile matters individually.

4. **Sorting and List Manipulation**: The code sorts the unique values of the piles and then attempts to manipulate these values, but this approach is incorrect for determining the winner. The key to solving this problem is to understand the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes), which determines the winner in such impartial games.

5. **Winning Condition**: The logic for determining the winner is incorrect. The code uses a loop to determine the winner based on the values in the list, but this logic does not correctly implement the game theory concept of Nim-sum.

A correct approach would involve calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def determine_winner():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

determine_winner()
```

This corrected program reads the input correctly, calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes, and determines the winner based on the Nim-sum.
