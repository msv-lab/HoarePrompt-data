Let's analyze the loop to determine the final output state.

The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list, modifying each element and updating `ls` (which stands for "last sum") in each iteration.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ls` is initialized to 0.
   - `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `nums` using the index `i`.
   - In each iteration:
     - `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] - ls`.
     - `ls` is updated to `ls + nums[i]`.

Let's see how this affects the elements of `nums`:

- **First Iteration (i=0):**
  - `nums[0]` is updated to `nums[0] - 0` (since `ls` is initially 0).
  - `ls` is updated to `0 + nums[0]` (which is the original value of `nums[0]`).

- **Second Iteration (i=1):**
  - `nums[1]` is updated to `nums[1] - nums[0]`.
  - `ls` is updated to `nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0]` (which simplifies to `nums[1]`).

- **Third Iteration (i=2):**
  - `nums[2]` is updated to `nums[2] - (nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0])` (which simplifies to `nums[2] - nums[1]`).
  - `ls` is updated to `(nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0]) + nums[2] - nums[1]` (which simplifies to `nums[2]`).

Following this pattern, in the `i-th` iteration:
- `nums[i]` is updated to `nums[i] - (sum of all previous nums[j] for j < i)`.
- `ls` is updated to the sum of all previous `nums[j]` for `j <= i`.

By the end of the loop, each element `nums[i]` will be the difference between the original `nums[i]` and the sum of all previous elements in the list. This effectively transforms `nums` into a list of differences between consecutive elements, starting from the original first element.

The final value of `ls` will be the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `nums` is transformed into a list where each element is the difference between the original element and the sum of all previous elements.
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list.**
