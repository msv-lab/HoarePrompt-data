The given code snippet only sets the variable `cw` to `True`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element with at least 2 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True` if `cw` is `True`, `nw` is `False` if `cw` is `False`, `cw` is `True`, and `i` is `i - 2`.**
