Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the input integer representing the length of the array `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the input. If `n` is equal to 2, then the current value of `n` is 2. Otherwise, there is no change to `n` or `a`. `max` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the original `max`; `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `temp` is a sorted list containing `a[4]`, `a[5]`, and `a[6]`; `max` is the maximum of its original value and the second element of `temp`; `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
