Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input; `i` is 2; `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`; `max` is updated to be the second element of the sorted list `temp` if the second element of `temp` (before sorting) was greater than the original `max`; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
