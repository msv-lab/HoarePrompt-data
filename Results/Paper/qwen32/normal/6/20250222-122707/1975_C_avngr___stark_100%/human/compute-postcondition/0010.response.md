The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` assigns a slice of the list `a` to the variable `temp`. The slice starts at index `i` and includes up to the next 3 elements (up to but not including the element at index `i + 3`). The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `max` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is not defined in the provided initial state, so we cannot determine the exact elements of `temp` without knowing the value of `i`. However, we can describe the state after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `max` is 0; `temp` is a slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements.**
