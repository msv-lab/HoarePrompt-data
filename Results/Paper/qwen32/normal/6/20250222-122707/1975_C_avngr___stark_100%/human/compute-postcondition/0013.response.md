The value of `max` is updated to be the second element of the list `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max` (which is 0), `max` will now hold this new value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `max` is the second element of `temp`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements; the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`.**
