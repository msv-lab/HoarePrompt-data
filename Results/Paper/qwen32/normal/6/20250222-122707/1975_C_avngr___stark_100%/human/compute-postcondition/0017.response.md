The code snippet sorts the list `temp`. This sorting affects the order of elements within `temp`, but it does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, or `i`. The only change is in the ordering of the elements within `temp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements; `max` is updated if the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
