The code sorts the list `temp` which contains the first three elements of the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `max` remain unchanged. The list `temp` will now be in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 0, `max` is 0, `temp` is the sorted list containing the first three elements of `a`.**
