Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and is at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `max` is the second element of `temp`, and `temp` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index 2 and including the next two elements.**

In simple terms, the value of `max` is now updated to be the second element of the sorted sublist `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
