Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` consists of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array `a`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(min(a))
        continue
    max = 0
    for i in range(n - 2):
        temp = a[i:i + 3]
        temp.sort()
        if temp[1] > max:
            max = temp[1]
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is `n-2`, `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and is at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is `n-3`, and `max` is the maximum value of the second elements of all sorted sublists of three consecutive elements in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
