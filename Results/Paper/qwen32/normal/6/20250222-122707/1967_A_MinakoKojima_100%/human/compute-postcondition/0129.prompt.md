Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are as per the new input, `a` is the newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the first element of `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, `k`, `ans`, and `res` are updated based on the condition `k >= dif * (i + 1)`. Specifically, if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, and `res` is updated to `n - 2`. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, `ans` remains the first element of `a`, and `res` remains `n - 1` unless `i` is 0, in which case the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2` indicating that `a[i + 1]` is equal to `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is not 0 and `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `dif` is not 0 and `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `k` becomes 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is not 0, `ans` is updated based on the value of `k` relative to `dif * (i + 1)`, and `k` and `res` are adjusted accordingly. If `k` was not 0 and `i` was not 0, `res` is further adjusted by `k % (i + 1)` and `k` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
