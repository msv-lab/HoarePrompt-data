The code snippet `ans += k // n` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `n` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `ans_list` contains all previous values of `ans` plus the final value of `ans`, `ans` is the final accumulated value, `res` is the final adjusted value, `k` is not 0, `n` is unchanged, and `a` is unchanged, the output state will have `ans` updated to its new value, while other variables retain their initial state.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains all previous values of `ans` plus the final value of `ans`; `ans` is the final accumulated value plus `k // n`; `res` is the final adjusted value; `k` is not 0; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged.**
