Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, a is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, ans_list contains the previous value of ans appended to it, dif is a[i + 1] - a[i] and is not 0. If k is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and ans remains the first element of a. Otherwise, k, ans, and res are updated based on the condition k >= dif * (i + 1). If k >= dif * (i + 1), k is updated to k - dif * (i + 1), ans is updated to the first element of a plus dif, and res is updated to n - 2. If k < dif * (i + 1), k is set to 0, ans remains the first element of a, and res remains n - 1 if i is not 0. If i is 0, res remains n - 1 and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
