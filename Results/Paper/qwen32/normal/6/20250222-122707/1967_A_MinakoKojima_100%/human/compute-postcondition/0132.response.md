The code snippet `res += k % n` updates the value of `res` by adding the remainder of `k` divided by `n` to it. The values of `ans` and `k` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `k` is not 0 still holds.

Output State: **`ans` is the final computed sum plus `k // n`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed (or 0 if all completed) plus `k % n`, and `k` is not 0.**
