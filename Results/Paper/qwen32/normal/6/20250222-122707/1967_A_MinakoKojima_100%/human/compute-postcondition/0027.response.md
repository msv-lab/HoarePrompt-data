Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and `dif` is not equal to 0, `i` remains 0. If `k` is 0, then `k` remains 0, `ans` is the smallest element in the list `a`, and `res` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain as per the initial conditions described in the precondition.**
