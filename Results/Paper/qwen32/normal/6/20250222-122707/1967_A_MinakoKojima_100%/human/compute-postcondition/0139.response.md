The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer, storing the result in a new list `a`. This operation does not affect the variables `ans_list`, `ans`, `res`, `k`, or `n`.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed minus 1, and `k` is 0 if exhausted; `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
