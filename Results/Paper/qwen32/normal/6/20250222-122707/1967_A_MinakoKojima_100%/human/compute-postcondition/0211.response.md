Given the initial state, we know that `ans_list` is a list that contains at least three elements, and `a` is defined as the third element in `ans_list`. Since the exact elements of `ans_list` are not provided, we cannot determine the explicit value of `a`. However, based on the information provided, we can describe the value of `a` as the third element of `ans_list`.

The print statement will output the value of `a`, which is the third element of `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is the third element of ans_list)**
