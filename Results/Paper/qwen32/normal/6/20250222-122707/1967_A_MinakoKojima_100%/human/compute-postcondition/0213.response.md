Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of distinct types of cards, and an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) representing the number of coins. It also accepts a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), where `a_i` represents the number of cards of type `i` initially available. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given parameters.**
