Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, a is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, ans_list contains the previous value of ans appended to it, dif is a[i + 1] - a[i] and is not 0, k is 0, ans is the first element of a, and if i is not 0, res is n - 1; if i is 0, res is n - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
