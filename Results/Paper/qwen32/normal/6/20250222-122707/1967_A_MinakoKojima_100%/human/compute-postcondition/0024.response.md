Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and `dif` is not equal to 0, `i` remains 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is the smallest element in the list `a` plus `dif`, `k` is reduced by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `ans` is the smallest element in the list `a`, and `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (i + 1)` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
