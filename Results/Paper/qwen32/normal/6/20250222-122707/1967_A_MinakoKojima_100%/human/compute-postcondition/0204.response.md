Output State: **`ans_list` contains all previous values of `ans` plus the final value of `ans` and the newly appended value of `ans`; `ans` is updated to `ans + res + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`; `k` is 0 or not 0; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `res` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `ans` to `ans_list`, so `ans_list` now includes all its previous values plus the latest value of `ans`. The value of `ans` itself is updated in the initial state description, and no other variables are changed by this specific line of code.
