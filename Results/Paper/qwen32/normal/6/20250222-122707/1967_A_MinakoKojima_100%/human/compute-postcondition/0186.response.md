Output State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by `dif`. `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`.**

In natural language: The value of `i` remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains the same input integer, which is at least 2. The value of `dif` is still the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. The variable `res` is decreased by 1 if `dif` is 0. The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `dif`. The variable `k` is decreased by the value of `dif * (i + 1)`.
