Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1; `ans` is `ans + dif`; `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`**.

In simple terms, the value of `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from it. All other variables retain their previous states and values as described.
