Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the new `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. The current value of `hd` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the value of `hd` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `a1 - a2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `hd` is greater than 0 still holds, but it is now greater than or equal to 0.
