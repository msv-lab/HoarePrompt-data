You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we have two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n`.
- `s1` represents the initial state of the boxes (1 for a cat, 0 for empty).
- `s2` represents the desired final state of the boxes.
- We need to determine the minimum number of operations to change `s1` to `s2`.
- Operations allowed:
  - Place a cat in an empty box.
  - Remove a cat from a box.
  - Move a cat from one box to another.

### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the number of '1's in both `s1` and `s2` and computes the difference `hd` (number of cats in `s1` minus number of cats in `s2`). It then calculates the absolute difference `res` between the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. The program iterates through the boxes and adjusts `res` based on whether the current box needs to be changed.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling the Difference in Counts (`hd`)**:
   - The program correctly calculates the difference in the number of cats between the initial and final states.
   - It uses this difference to determine the number of operations needed to balance the number of cats.

2. **Iterating and Adjusting `res`**:
   - The program iterates through the boxes and checks if the current box needs to be changed.
   - If `hd` is positive, it means there are more cats in the initial state than in the final state. It decrements `hd` and continues to the next box.
   - If `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, it means there's a cat in the box that needs to be moved or removed, so it increments `res`.

### Test Cases:
Let's check the program against the provided examples:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - `s1 = "10010"`, `s2 = "00001"`
   - `hd = 2 - 1 = 1`, `res = 1`
   - Iterate through boxes:
     - `i = 0`: `hd > 0`, decrement `hd` to 0.
     - `i = 1`: No change.
     - `i = 2`: No change.
     - `i = 3`: `s1[3] == '1'` and `s2[3] == '0'`, increment `res` to 2.
     - `i = 4`: No change.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `s1 = "1"`, `s2 = "1"`
   - `hd = 1 - 1 = 0`, `res = 0`
   - Iterate through boxes:
     - `i = 0`: No change.
   - Output: `0` (Correct).

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `s1 = "000"`, `s2 = "111"`
   - `hd = 0 - 3 = -3`, `res = 3`
   - Iterate through boxes:
     - `i = 0`: `s1[0] == '0'` and `s2[0] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
     - `i = 1`: `s1[1] == '0'` and `s2[1] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
     - `i = 2`: `s1[2] == '0'` and `s2[2] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
   - Output: `3` (Correct).

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - `s1 = "0101"`, `s2 = "1010"`
   - `hd = 2 - 2 = 0`, `res = 0`
   - Iterate through boxes:
     - `i = 0`: `s1[0] == '0'` and `s2[0] == '1'`, increment `res` to 1.
     - `i = 1`: `s1[1] == '1'` and `s2[1] == '0'`, increment `res` to 2.
     - `i = 2`: No change.
     - `i = 3`: `s1[3] == '1'` and `s2[3] == '0'`, increment `res` to 3.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - `s1 = "100"`, `s2 = "101"`
   - `hd = 1 - 2 = -1`, `res = 1`
   - Iterate through boxes:
     - `i = 0`: No change.
     - `i = 1`: `s1[1] == '0'` and `s2[1] == '0'`, `res` remains 1.
     - `i = 2`: `s1[2] == '0'` and `s2[2] == '1'`, `res` remains 1.
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - `s1 = "10011001"`, `s2 = "11111110"`
   - `hd = 4 - 7 = -3`, `res = 3`
   - Iterate through boxes:
     - `i = 0`: No change.
     - `i = 1`: `s1[1] == '0'` and `s2[1] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
     - `i = 2`: `s1[2] == '0'` and `s2[2] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
     - `i = 3`: `s1[3] == '1'` and `s2[3] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
     - `i = 4`: `s1[4] == '1'` and `s2[4] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
     - `i = 5`: `s1[5] == '0'` and `s2[5] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
     - `i = 6`: `s1[6] == '0'` and `s2[6] == '1'`, `res` remains 3.
     - `i = 7`: `s1[7] == '1'` and `s2[7] == '0'`, increment `res` to 4.
   - Output: `4` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly handle all the provided test cases and the logic seems sound. The program calculates the number of operations needed to balance the number of cats and then adjusts based on the specific boxes that need to be changed.

Correctness: **True**.
