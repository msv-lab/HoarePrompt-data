The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not affect the logic inside the loop, it doesn't need to be adjusted in terms of its value. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was such that the loop executed. To execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `max(0, a1 - a2 - n)`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + count of positions i where `s1[i] == '1' and `s2[i] == '0' and `hd` is not greater than 0.**
