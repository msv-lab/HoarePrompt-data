The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was initially greater than 0, then `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2`; otherwise, `hd` is `-1`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`; otherwise, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. `i` is 2**
