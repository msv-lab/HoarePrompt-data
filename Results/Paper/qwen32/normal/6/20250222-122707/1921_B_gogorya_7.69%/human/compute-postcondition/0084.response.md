Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was originally greater than 0, then `hd` is `hd - 2`, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`, otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `hd` is decremented by 1. If `hd` was originally greater than 0, it is now `hd - 2` because it was already decremented once in the initial state description. Otherwise, `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
