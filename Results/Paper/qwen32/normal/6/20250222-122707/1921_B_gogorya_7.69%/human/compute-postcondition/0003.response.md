`input()` is called and the result is assigned to `s1`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the string input.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the string input.**
