The code snippet `a1 = s1.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s1` and assigns this count to the variable `a1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`.**
