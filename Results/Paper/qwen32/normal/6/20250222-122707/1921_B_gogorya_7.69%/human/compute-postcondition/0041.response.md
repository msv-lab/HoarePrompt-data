The value of `hd` is decremented by 1. Given that `hd` was initially greater than 0, after this operation, `hd` will still be non-negative. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`**.
