Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two strings `s` and `f` of equal length `n`, where `s` and `f` consist only of '0' and '1'. The function returns a value for each test case based on the comparison of strings `s` and `f`.**
