### Reasoning:

The provided program seems to follow the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` (length of the permutation, duration of the game, starting positions of Bodya and Sasha).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of the permutation and array by subtracting 1 from each element. This is because Python uses 0-based indexing, but the problem statement uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` with `k` turns.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current cumulative score), and `vis` (visited positions).
   - It then iterates while the position `s` has not been visited and `k` turns are remaining.
   - In each iteration, it marks the position `s` as visited, updates `mx` with the maximum of the current `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`, adds `a[s]` to `cur`, decrements `k` by 1, and moves to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores `A` and `B` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, the program compares them:
     - If `A == B`, it prints "Draw".
     - If `A > B`, it prints "Bodya".
     - If `A < B`, it prints "Sasha".

### Issues in the Program:
The program has a logical flaw in the calculation of the score. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score by assuming the player always moves to the next position in the permutation until `k` turns are used or a cycle is detected. However, in the game, the player can choose to stay at the current position, which might lead to a higher score.

### Correctness:
Given the logical flaw in the program, it does not correctly determine the maximum score a player can achieve by considering all possible moves (stay or move).

**Correctness: False**

The program should be modified to consider all possible moves (stay or move) at each turn to accurately determine the maximum score for each player.
