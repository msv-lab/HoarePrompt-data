The value of `s` is updated to `p[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[p[S - 1]]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`, `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1 and at index `s` where it is 1.**
