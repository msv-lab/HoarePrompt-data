You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), p is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, s is a list of 4 integers [t, n, P_B, P_S] where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), and k is the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: `vis` is a list of n integers where positions corresponding to the visited indices are 1, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` values accumulated, `s` is the last visited position, and `k` is 0 if all turns were used or the remaining turns if a cycle was detected.
    return mx
    #The program returns mx, which is the maximum value of cur + k * a[s] encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `p` representing a permutation, a list of four integers `s` containing test case details, and an integer `k` representing the number of turns. It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns mx, which is the maximum value of cur + k * a[s] encountered.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
