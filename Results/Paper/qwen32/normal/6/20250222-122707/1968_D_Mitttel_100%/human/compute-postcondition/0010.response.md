To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `not vis[s]` (i.e., the element at index `s` in the `vis` list is 0).
2. `k > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of n integers.
- `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation.
- `s` is `p[P_S - 1]`.
- `k` is `k - 1`.
- `mx` is `max(0, cur + k * a[s])`.
- `cur` is `a[s]`.
- `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. `not vis[s]`: Since `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1, `vis[s]` will be 0 unless `s == P_B - 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `s` is not equal to `P_B - 1`.

2. `k > 0`: Since `k` is `k - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the above conditions, we need to adjust `s` and `k`:
- `s` should not be equal to `P_B - 1`.
- `k` should be greater than 0.

Since `s` is derived from `p[P_S - 1]`, we can adjust `P_S` to ensure `s` is not equal to `P_B - 1`. We can also adjust `k` to be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[P_S - 1]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `mx` is `max(0, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1**.
