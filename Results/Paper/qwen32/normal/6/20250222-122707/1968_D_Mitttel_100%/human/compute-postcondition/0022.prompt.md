Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a list of 4 integers [t, n, P_B, P_S] where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), and k is the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of n zeros.
Code of the loop:
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    vis[s] = 1
    mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
    cur += a[s]
    k -= 1
    s = p[s]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is `p[P_S - 1]`, `k` is `k - 1`, `mx` is max(0, cur + k * a[s]), `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of n integers, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[p[S - 1]]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`, `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1 and at index `s` where it is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[s]`, `k` is `k - 1` (must be greater than 0), `mx` is `max(mx, a[s] * (2 + k))`, `cur` is `4 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is `1` and at index `s` where it is `1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
