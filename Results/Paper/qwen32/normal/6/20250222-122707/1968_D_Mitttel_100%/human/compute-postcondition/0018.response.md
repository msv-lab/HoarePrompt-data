The given Python code snippet updates the value of `mx` based on the current value of `mx`, `cur`, `k`, and `a[s]`. The variables `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `cur`, `vis`, and `mx` are all given in the initial state. The code does not alter the values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `cur`, or `vis`, it only updates `mx`.

Given:
- `mx` is initially `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`
- `cur` is `2 * a[s]`

The new value of `mx` will be the maximum of its current value and the expression `cur + k * a[s]`.

Since `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, the expression `cur + k * a[s]` becomes `2 * a[s] + k * a[s]`, which simplifies to `a[s] * (2 + k)`.

Therefore, the new value of `mx` will be `max(mx, a[s] * (2 + k))`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[p[S - 1]]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `mx` is `max(mx, a[s] * (2 + k))`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is `1` and at index `s` where it is `1`.**
