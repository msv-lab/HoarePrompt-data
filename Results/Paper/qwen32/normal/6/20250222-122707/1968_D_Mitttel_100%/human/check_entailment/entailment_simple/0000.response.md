### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given rules. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based (since Python uses zero-based indexing).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(a, p, s, k)` calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` with `k` turns.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - Inside a while loop, it updates the current score `cur` by adding `a[s]` and checks if the current position `s` has been visited before.
   - If `k` turns are used up or a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited), the loop terminates.
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx` encountered.

4. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It then compares these scores to determine the winner.

### Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The program correctly detects cycles in the permutation using the `vis` list. Once a cycle is detected, it stops further exploration and returns the maximum score encountered so far.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the score for each player by summing the values in `a` as they move through the permutation.
  - The maximum score `mx` for each player is calculated as `cur + k * a[s]` where `cur` is the accumulated score and `k` is the remaining turns. This formula ensures that if a cycle is detected, the player can stay in the cycle and keep adding the value of `a[s]` for the remaining turns.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) by detecting cycles and using the remaining turns efficiently.
  - It also correctly handles cases where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same or different.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided rules and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
