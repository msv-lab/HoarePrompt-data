Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that would lead to incorrect results:

1. **Index Adjustment**: The program adjusts the indices of the permutation and array by subtracting 1, which is correct for converting 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing. However, the same adjustment is applied to the scores in the array `a`, which is incorrect. The scores should remain unchanged as they are not indices.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting from a given position `s` and playing for `k` turns. The logic inside the function seems to assume that the player can stay in the same position for the remaining turns after entering a cycle, which is not necessarily optimal. The player might choose to move to different positions within the cycle to maximize the score.

3. **Cycle Detection and Scoring**: The function `func_1` does not handle cycles correctly. Once a cycle is detected, the player can stay in the cycle and maximize the score by choosing the best position within the cycle. The current implementation does not account for this properly.

4. **Cycle Scoring**: When a cycle is detected, the function should calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by staying in the cycle for the remaining turns. This involves finding the maximum score within the cycle and determining the optimal number of full cycles to complete and the best position to end in for the remaining turns.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:

- Not adjust the scores in the array `a`.
- Properly detect cycles and calculate the maximum score that can be achieved within the cycle.
- Consider the optimal strategy for staying in or moving within cycles to maximize the score.

Given these points, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.
