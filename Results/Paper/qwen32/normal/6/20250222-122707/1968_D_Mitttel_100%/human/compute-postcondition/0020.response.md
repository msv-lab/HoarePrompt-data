The value of `k` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation, `s` is `p[p[S - 1]]` where `P_S - 1` is not equal to `P_B - 1`, `k` is `k - 1` (must be greater than 0), `mx` is `max(mx, a[s] * (2 + k))`, `cur` is `4 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is `1` and at index `s` where it is `1`.**
