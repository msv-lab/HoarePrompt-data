You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string. n is an integer initialized to 0, and ans is an integer initialized to 0. The function iterates over the list s to calculate a value based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is the original binary list, `n` is the count of consecutive 1s at the end of the list (or 0 if the last element is 0), and `ans` is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list `s`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `s` of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string. It calculates a value based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0 and returns this calculated value.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
