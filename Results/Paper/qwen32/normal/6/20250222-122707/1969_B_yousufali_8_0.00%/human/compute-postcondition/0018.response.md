The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` are not directly modified by this line of code, so they retain their previous states. 

Given the initial state, `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and `s` must have at least 1 element. The value of `i` is `i + 1` from a previous operation, and if `s[i]` was 1, then `n` is `n + 1` from a previous operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element; `i` is `i + 1`; if `s[i]` was 1, then `n` is `n + 1`; `ans` is `ans + n + 1`.**
