To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it modifies the variables `n` and `ans` based on the values in the list `s`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `s` is a binary list (contains only 0s and 1s).
   - `n` is initialized to 0.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `s`.
   - If the current element `s[i]` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1.
   - If the current element `s[i]` is 0 and `n` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`.

Let's understand what happens as the loop runs through all elements of `s`:

- **Counting 1s**: `n` keeps a count of the number of consecutive 1s encountered.
- **Adding to `ans`**: When a 0 is encountered and `n` is not 0, it means there were `n` consecutive 1s before this 0. The value `n + 1` is added to `ans` to account for all possible substrings of 1s ending at this 0. After adding, `n` is reset to 0 because the sequence of 1s has been broken.

After the loop finishes, `n` will be 0 if the last element of `s` is 0, or it will be the count of consecutive 1s if the last element of `s` is 1. However, in either case, `ans` will have accumulated the correct value based on the described logic.

**Final Output State**:
- `s` remains the same as the input list of integers.
- `n` will be 0 if the last element of `s` is 0, or it will be the count of consecutive 1s if the last element of `s` is 1.
- `ans` will be the sum of all `n + 1` values added whenever a 0 is encountered and `n` is not 0.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`s` is the original binary list, `n` is the count of consecutive 1s at the end of the list (or 0 if the last element is 0), and `ans` is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list.**
