Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is incorrectly reading the input. It should read a binary string, not a list of integers. The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` will fail for binary strings because `input().split()` will split the string by spaces, which does not apply here. It should be `s = input().strip()` to read the entire line as a string.

2. **Logic for Calculation**: The logic used in `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost is incorrect. The function is trying to count the number of 1s before each 0 and adding the cost based on that, but this does not account for the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts as described in the problem.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem, one needs to determine the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the binary string in non-descending order. A correct approach would be to count the number of '1's before each '0' and calculate the cost based on the positions of these characters, but the provided logic is not doing this correctly.

The program needs to be revised to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost as per the problem statement.
