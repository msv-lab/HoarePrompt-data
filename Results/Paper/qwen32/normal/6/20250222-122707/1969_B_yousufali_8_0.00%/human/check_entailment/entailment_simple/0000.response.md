Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to solve the problem of determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost but instead calculates a different value.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to sort the binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s).
   - The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.
   - The task is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted order.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - `func_1` reads a binary string, counts the number of 1s encountered before each 0, and calculates a value `ans` based on this count.
   - The value `ans` is calculated as the sum of `(n + 1)` for each 0 encountered, where `n` is the number of 1s before that 0.
   - The program prints `ans` for each test case.

3. **Correctness of the Implementation:**
   - The value `ans` calculated by `func_1` does not represent the minimum cost to sort the string. It simply counts the number of 1s before each 0 and adds 1 to each count, which is not related to the cost of cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of sorting the string involves calculating the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all 1s to the end of the string, which is a more complex task than just counting 1s before 0s.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `101011`, the correct minimum cost to sort the string is 5, but `func_1` would output a different value.
   - The provided example outputs do not match the expected minimum cost for sorting the strings.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
