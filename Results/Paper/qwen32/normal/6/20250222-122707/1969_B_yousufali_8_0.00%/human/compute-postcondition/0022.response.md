To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the variables and how they are related to the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s`: This is the original binary list.
- `n`: This is the count of consecutive 1s at the end of the list (or 0 if the last element is 0).
- `ans`: This is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list.

### Analysis:
- `s` is a binary list, meaning it contains only 0s and 1s.
- `n` keeps track of the number of consecutive 1s at the end of the list.
- `ans` is a variable that accumulates the count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list.

### Calculation of `ans`:
To calculate `ans`, we need to iterate through the list `s` and count the substrings of 1s that end at each 0. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how `ans` is calculated:

1. Initialize `n` to 0 (count of consecutive 1s).
2. Initialize `ans` to 0 (total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0).
3. Iterate through each element in the list `s`:
   - If the element is 1, increment `n` by 1.
   - If the element is 0, add `n` to `ans` and reset `n` to 0.
4. After the loop, `ans` will contain the total count of substrings of 1s that end at each 0 encountered in the list.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `s = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`
- Iteration:
  - `s[0] = 1`, `n = 1`
  - `s[1] = 1`, `n = 2`
  - `s[2] = 0`, `ans = 2`, `n = 0`
  - `s[3] = 1`, `n = 1`
  - `s[4] = 1`, `n = 2`
  - `s[5] = 1`, `n = 3`
  - `s[6] = 0`, `ans = 2 + 3 = 5`, `n = 0`

In this example, `ans` would be 5.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the total count of substrings of 1s that end at each 0 encountered in the list `s`.
Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list `s`)**
