The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given the initial state, `res` was either 0 or 1 based on the condition of the current element `a[i]`. Since `i` is `len(a) + 1`, it is out of bounds for the list `a`, and the condition about `a[i]` does not apply. Therefore, we only need to consider the increment of `res`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the length of `a` after removing all trailing zeros where 1 <= `n` <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, the first element is not 0 if `a` is not empty; `res` is either 1 or 2; `i` is `len(a) + 1`.**
