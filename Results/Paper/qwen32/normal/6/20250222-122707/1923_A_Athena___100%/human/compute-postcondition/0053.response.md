The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that `0 <= t - 1 <= 999`, which implies `1 <= t <= 1000`. This indicates that `i` was `t - 1` in the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list with at least one element; if the current element `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1; otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
