Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` = 0; `n` is undefined; `a` is undefined; `res` is undefined.**

In natural language, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly with each iteration. The variables `n`, `a`, and `res` are not defined outside of the loop's scope and do not retain their values after each iteration. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, these variables do not have a defined state.
