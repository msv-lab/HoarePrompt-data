Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The current implementation simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the optimal way to move the chips to form a contiguous block.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 0 0 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The chips are at positions 1 and 4.
- To form a single block, we can move the chip at position 4 to position 3.
- This requires 1 operation.

**Actual Output of the Provided Code:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The code counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is 2 (positions 2 and 3).
- However, moving the chip at position 4 to position 3 is optimal and requires only 1 operation.

The code does not consider the optimal way to move the chips to minimize the number of operations. It only counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which is not always the correct approach.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
