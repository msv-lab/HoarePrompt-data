Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is `[]`; `res` is 0**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `a` is empty because the loop repeatedly removes the last element of `a` as long as it is zero. The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
