Output State: **`t` is \(t-2\) such that \(0 \leq t-2 \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is `bullets_used + health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True.**

In simple terms, the variable `bullets_used` has been incremented by the value of `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
