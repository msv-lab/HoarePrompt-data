Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order to maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty is calculated by iterating through the sorted array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Checking Order:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, and the program prints `0` as the beauty, which is incorrect. The function should not influence the beauty calculation; it should be removed or fixed.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, even if the array is sorted, the beauty should still be calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrectly affects the output.
  
### Correct Approach:
- The program should directly sort the array and calculate the beauty without checking if the array is already sorted.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect use of the function `func_1`.

**Correctness: False**
