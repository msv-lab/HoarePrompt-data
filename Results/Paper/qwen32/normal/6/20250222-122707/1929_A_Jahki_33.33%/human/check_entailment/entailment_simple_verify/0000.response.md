### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements when the array is rearranged optimally. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

The strategy to maximize this beauty is to sort the array in non-increasing order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
   
2. **`func_1` Function:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that this function returns `True` for non-decreasing order, which is not the intended behavior for calculating the maximum beauty. The function should not be used to determine if the array should be rearranged.

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - The program sorts the array in non-decreasing order and calculates the beauty based on this sorted array.
   - This is incorrect because sorting in non-decreasing order does not maximize the beauty. Instead, the array should be sorted in non-increasing order to maximize the beauty.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the logical error in the program. The program should sort the array in non-increasing order to maximize the beauty, not in non-decreasing order.

#### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
1
3
1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```
This is because sorting the array in non-increasing order gives `[3, 2, 1]`, and the beauty is `(3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 4`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```
The program sorts the array in non-decreasing order `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty because it sorts the array in non-decreasing order instead of non-increasing order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
