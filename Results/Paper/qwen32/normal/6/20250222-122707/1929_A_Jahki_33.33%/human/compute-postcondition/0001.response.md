To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, num2):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `num2`.

Here are the steps to determine the adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be set to any specific value because it is set by the loop itself.

2. **Variable `num2`**: The loop will execute if `num2` is greater than 1. This is because the range function `range(1, num2)` will produce at least one value (1) if `num2` is greater than 1. If `num2` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

3. **Variable `a`**: The variable `a` is a list of integers with a length between 2 and 100. However, since `a` is not directly used in the loop head, its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. It is mentioned in the state before the loop but does not influence the loop's execution condition.

4. **Variable `order`**: The variable `order` is set to 0 before the loop starts. Since `order` is not used in the loop head, its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `num2` is greater than 1. The state of `a`, `i`, and `order` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, such that `num2` > 1; `order` is 0**
