Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function and the overall logic for calculating the maximum beauty of the array is incorrect.

The `func_1` function is intended to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it incorrectly returns `True` if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, which means the program will output `0` for already sorted arrays. This contradicts the problem description, which requires the program to calculate the maximum beauty regardless of the initial order of the array.

Additionally, the program sorts the array in non-decreasing order and calculates the beauty based on this sorted array. However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in non-increasing order instead, as this will maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```
This is because the maximum beauty is achieved with the array sorted in non-increasing order: `[3, 2, 1]`, resulting in a beauty of `(3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 4`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```
The program sorts the array in non-decreasing order: `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`.

To fix the program, the array should be sorted in non-increasing order, and the beauty should be calculated based on this sorted array.
