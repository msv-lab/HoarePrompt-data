Let's break down the given information and determine what the `print(n)` statement will output.

### Initial State Summary:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).
- The current value of `x` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
The `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n`, which is a calculated value based on the input integers `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f`.

- `n` is the sum of the squares of the differences between the pairs of coordinates \((a, b)\) and \((e, f)\).

### Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is calculated as (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f))**
