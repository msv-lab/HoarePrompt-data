Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine the area of the square. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances, which does not correspond to the area of the square.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and y-coordinates among the four given points.
2. Calculate the side length of the square as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes).
3. Compute the area of the square by squaring the side length.

The execution summary provided does not align with the logic needed to solve the problem correctly. It suggests that the program is calculating something related to the distance between points, which is not the correct approach for finding the area of the square.

Correctness: **False**
