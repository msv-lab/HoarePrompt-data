Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly compute the area of the square based on the given corner coordinates. The program attempts to calculate the squared distance between pairs of corners and then prints the smaller of the two distances squared. However, the area of a square is calculated as the square of the length of one of its sides, not the distance between arbitrary pairs of corners.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the side length of the square, which can be done by calculating the distance between any two adjacent corners. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        corners = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        corners.sort()  # Sort corners to make it easier to identify adjacent sides

        # Calculate side length using the first two corners (assuming they are adjacent)
        side_length_x = abs(corners[0][0] - corners[1][0])
        side_length_y = abs(corners[0][1] - corners[1][1])

        # The side length of the square will be the non-zero difference
        side_length = side_length_x if side_length_x != 0 else side_length_y

        # Calculate area
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

The above program correctly calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent corners and then computes the area as the square of the side length.

Given the incorrect logic in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
