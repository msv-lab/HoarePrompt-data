To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the given for loop:

```python
for steps in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variables in the loop head are `steps` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate at least one value (0) if `t` is 1 or more.

Given that `t` is already described as an integer representing the number of test cases where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), the state before the loop starts already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is needed. However, `steps` is a loop variable that gets assigned values from the range, so we don't need to set it before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
