Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The coordinates of the corners of the squares and their areas are still to be read.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers read from the input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `e` and `f` are new integers read from the input; `g` and `h` are new integers read from the input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is recalculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`; if the new `x` is greater than `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`; `steps` is 4; `c` and `d` are new integers read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `e` and `f` are integers read from the input; `g` and `h` are new integers read from the input; `n` is recalculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is recalculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`; `steps` is 5; `c` and `d` are integers read from the input. If `x` is greater than `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
