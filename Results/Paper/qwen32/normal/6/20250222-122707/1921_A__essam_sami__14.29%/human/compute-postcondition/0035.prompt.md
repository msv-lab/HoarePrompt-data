You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is described by four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) which are the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive (strictly greater than 0) area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the coordinates of the corners of two squares were read: (a, b), (c, d) for the first square, and (e, f), (g, h) for the second square. The distances squared from the center of the first square to the center of the second square were calculated as `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` and `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. For each test case, the smaller of the two distances squared (`n` or `x`) was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function returns the area of each square.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
