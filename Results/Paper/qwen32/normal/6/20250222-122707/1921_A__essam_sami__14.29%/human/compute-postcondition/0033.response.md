Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the coordinates of the corners of two squares were read: (a, b), (c, d) for the first square, and (e, f), (g, h) for the second square. The distances squared from the center of the first square to the center of the second square were calculated as `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` and `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. For each test case, the smaller of the two distances squared (`n` or `x`) was printed.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished processing all `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculated the squared distances from the center of two squares to each other and printed the smaller of the two distances.
