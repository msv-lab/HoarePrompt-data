Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers read from the input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`; `steps` is 4.**

Explanation: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input. The values of `t`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, `x`, and `steps` remain unchanged.
