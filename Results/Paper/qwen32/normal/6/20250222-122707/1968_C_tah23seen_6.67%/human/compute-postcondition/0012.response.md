Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers. If `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[1]` and its previous values, and so on until `ans[n-1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[n-2]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[n-2]` and its previous values. Otherwise, the values of `ans` remain as initially defined with `ans[0]` as `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` as `2 * arr[0] + 1` and the rest of the elements in `ans` as 0.**
