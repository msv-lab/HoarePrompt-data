The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (as per the previous state), and `n` is such that `3 ≤ n ≤ 500`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers, `i` is 4**
