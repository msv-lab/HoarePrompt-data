### Reasoning:

The given program aims to construct an array `a` such that for each `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, `a_i = x_i mod a_{i-1}` where `x_i` is provided in the input. The program uses a function `func_1` to achieve this.

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_1` is greater than `x_2` (which is `arr[0]`), and hence `x_2 = a_2 mod a_1` can be satisfied by choosing `a_2` appropriately.
   
2. **Loop for `i` from `0` to `n-3`**:
   - `ans[i + 1]` is set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `a_{i+2} mod a_{i+1}` can be satisfied because `a_{i+2}` is constructed to be larger than `a_{i+1}` and can be adjusted to match `x_{i+2}`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the program enters a while loop to increase `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+2} mod a_{i+1}` can be adjusted to match `x_{i+2}`.
   
3. **Final Element**:
   - `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n = x_n mod a_{n-1}` can be satisfied by construction.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly ensure that `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. Specifically, the way `ans[i + 1]` is constructed does not guarantee that `ans[i + 1] mod ans[i] = arr[i]` for all `i`.
- The while loop only ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, but it does not guarantee the correct modular relationship.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly generate the array `a` that satisfies the condition `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
