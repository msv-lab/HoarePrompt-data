The code modifies the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 4, `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[5]` and `ans[i]` is `ans[4]`. Therefore, `ans[5]` is updated to `ans[5] + ans[4]`.

Since `ans[5]` was initially defined as `arr[4] + ans[4]`, after the operation, `ans[5]` becomes `arr[4] + ans[4] + ans[4]`, which simplifies to `arr[4] + 2 * ans[4]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) and `arr[5]` is `arr[4] + ans[4]`; `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[5]` is `arr[4] + 2 * ans[4]`; `i` is 4.**
