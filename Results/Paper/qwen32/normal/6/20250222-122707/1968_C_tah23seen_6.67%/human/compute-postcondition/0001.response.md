Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers with `n` elements where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and the rest are 0.**

Natural Language: The first element of the `ans` list is now equal to the first element of the `arr` list plus one, while all other elements in `ans` remain 0. The properties of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.
