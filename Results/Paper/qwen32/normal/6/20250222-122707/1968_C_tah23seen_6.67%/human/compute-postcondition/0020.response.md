The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is `k + 1` and `ans[k + 1]` is initially `0`. After the operation, `ans[k + 1]` will be updated to `ans[k]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[i + 1]` is now `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]` and `ans[k + 1]` is `ans[k]`; `i` is `k + 1`; `arr[k + 2]` is greater than `ans[k + 2]`.**
