The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the length of the string s, followed by the string s itself, which consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
