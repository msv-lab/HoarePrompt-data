Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" and returns a value based on these counts, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful. The program does not account for overlapping occurrences or the optimal sequence of deletions to remove the unwanted substrings.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to use a dynamic programming approach or a similar method to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string.
