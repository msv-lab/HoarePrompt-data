The loop head in this case only contains the underscore `_` and the `range(int(input()))`. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The `range(int(input()))` indicates that the loop will execute a number of times based on the integer input. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to consider how the loop's iteration count is affected.

Since the loop iterates based on the integer input, the state of `t`, `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z` should remain unchanged at the start of the next iteration. The only thing that changes is the implicit iteration count managed by the `for` loop, which we do not have direct control over in the state description.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `a` is the input integer; `s` is the new input string; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`; `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`**
