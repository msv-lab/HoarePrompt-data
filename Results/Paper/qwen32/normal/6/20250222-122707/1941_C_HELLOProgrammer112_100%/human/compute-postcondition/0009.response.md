The code snippet `s = input()` changes the value of `s` to whatever string is provided as input. The values of `t`, `a`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `a` is the input integer; `s` is the new input string; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`; `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`.**
