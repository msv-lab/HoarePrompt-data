The code snippet `y = s.count('pie')` counts the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. This will assign a specific integer value to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
