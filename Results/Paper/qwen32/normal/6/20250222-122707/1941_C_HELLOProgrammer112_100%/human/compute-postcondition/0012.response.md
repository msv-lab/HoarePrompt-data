The code snippet updates the value of `z` to be the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `a` is the input integer; `s` is the new input string; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`; `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`.**
