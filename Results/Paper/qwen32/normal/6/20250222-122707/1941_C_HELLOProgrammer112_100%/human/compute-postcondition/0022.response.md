Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s`, followed by the string `s` itself, which consists of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes each test case and returns the result based on the specific criteria or computation performed on the string `s`.**
