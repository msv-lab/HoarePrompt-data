To ensure that the given for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given that the loop will iterate `t` times where `t` is the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a positive integer. This means that the first input provided should be a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **The first input `t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.** 

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, with each iteration corresponding to a test case. The other variables (`n` and `s`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
