### Reasoning:

The program's purpose is to determine how to distribute coins across various outcomes such that the total coins bet are strictly less than the coins received back for any winning outcome. The given solution attempts to achieve this by calculating a common multiple and ensuring that the distribution of bets meets the conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome.
2. **Calculating Common Multiple**: For each test case, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers by multiplying all the multipliers together. This is stored in `m`.
3. **Generating Bets**: The bets are generated by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. This is stored in the list `c`.
4. **Simplifying Bets**: The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets and divides each bet by this GCD to simplify the bets.
5. **Checking Condition**: The program checks if the sum of the simplified bets is less than the simplified LCM. If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the simplified bets.

However, there's a critical issue with the provided program. The `func_1` function is supposed to calculate the GCD of the bets, but the comment suggests it calculates the GCD of `t` and all multipliers `k_i` from all test cases, which is incorrect. The GCD should only be computed for the bets in the current test case.

### Correctness:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the `func_1` function as mentioned above. It does not correctly calculate the GCD of the bets for each test case, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
