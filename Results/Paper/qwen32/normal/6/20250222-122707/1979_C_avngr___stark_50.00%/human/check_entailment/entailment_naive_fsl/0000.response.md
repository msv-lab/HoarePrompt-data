Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all cases. Specifically, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is incorrect. The sum of the bets should be strictly less than the minimum return for any winning outcome, which is `min(k[i] * c[i])` for all `i`. The current condition does not ensure this.

Let's consider a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
2
2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1 1
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
- If you bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total bet is 2 coins.
- If the first outcome wins, you get 2 * 1 = 2 coins back, which is not more than the total bet.
- If the second outcome wins, you get 3 * 1 = 3 coins back, which is more than the total bet.
- This distribution does not satisfy the requirement that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

However, the provided program might output something like:
```
1 1
```
But upon checking the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:`, it might incorrectly determine that this is a valid distribution because `sum(c) = 2` and `m / hcf` might not be correctly calculated to ensure the strict inequality.

Let's look at the specific logic:
- `m` is the product of all `k[i]`.
- `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`.
- The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is incorrect because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

A correct approach would be to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the minimum return for any winning outcome, which can be achieved by setting each `c[i]` to 1 and checking if the total bet is less than the minimum `k[i]`.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect.
