Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to distribute `n` bets such that the total sum of all bets is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. If `k_i` is the multiplier for the i-th outcome, the i-th bet should be `x_i` such that:
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_1 * x_1`
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_2 * x_2`
- ...
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_n * x_n`

This can be simplified to:
- `x_1 * (k_1 - 1) > x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_n`
- `x_2 * (k_2 - 1) > x_1 + x_3 + ... + x_n`
- ...
- `x_n * (k_n - 1) > x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_(n-1)`

One approach to satisfy this is to set each `x_i` to be a fraction of a common multiple of `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. Specifically, we can set `x_i` to be `m / k_i` where `m` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. This ensures that the sum of all `x_i` is less than `m`, and for each `x_i`, `k_i * x_i` is strictly greater than `m`.

The program calculates `m` as the product of all `k_i` (which is a multiple of the LCM), then sets `x_i` to `m / k_i`. It then normalizes these values by dividing by their greatest common divisor (GCD) to ensure the values are as small as possible while maintaining the inequality constraints.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
2. **Calculating `m`:** The program calculates `m` as the product of all `k_i`. This is a valid approach as `m` is a multiple of the LCM of `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
3. **Calculating `x_i`:** The program sets `x_i` to be `m / k_i`. This ensures that the sum of all `x_i` is less than `m`.
4. **Normalization:** The program normalizes the `x_i` values by dividing by their GCD. This step is not strictly necessary for the solution to be correct, but it ensures that the values are as small as possible.
5. **Checking Feasibility:** The program checks if the sum of the `x_i` values is less than `m / hcf`. If it is not, it outputs `-1`. However, given the construction of `x_i`, this condition should always be satisfied.
6. **Output:** The program outputs the `x_i` values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the described approach and should work for all valid inputs. The normalization step is not strictly necessary for correctness but is a good practice to ensure the output values are minimal.

**Correctness: True**
