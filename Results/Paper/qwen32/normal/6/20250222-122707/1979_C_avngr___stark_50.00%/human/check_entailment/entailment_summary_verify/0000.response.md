Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap
The task is to distribute bets on `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The return for the `i-th` outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the `i-th` outcome.

### Program Analysis
The provided program calculates the bets as follows:
1. Compute the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`.
2. Calculate `c[i]` as `m / k[i]` for each outcome.
3. Compute the GCD of all `c[i]` values.
4. Normalize the `c[i]` values by dividing each by the GCD.
5. Check if the sum of the normalized `c[i]` values is less than `m / hcf`.
6. If the condition is satisfied, print the normalized `c[i]` values; otherwise, print `-1`.

### Function Summary Evaluation
The function summary provided is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the GCD of the list `c`, not handle multiple test cases as described. The summary seems to mix up the purpose of the function.

### Correctness Analysis
The logic of the program needs to be verified against the problem requirements:
1. **Product Calculation (`m`)**: The product `m` of all `k_i` values is correctly computed.
2. **Bets Calculation (`c[i]`)**: Each `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that `k_i * c[i] = m` for each `i`.
3. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of the `c[i]` values is correctly computed.
4. **Normalization**: The `c[i]` values are normalized by dividing each by the GCD. This step ensures that the GCD of the normalized `c[i]` values is 1.
5. **Condition Check**: The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` checks if the total bet is less than the minimum return for any winning outcome. Here, `m / hcf` is the total bet, and since `c[i]` are normalized, `k_i * c[i]` is the return for each outcome, which is equal to `m / (hcf / k_i)`. The condition ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Counterexample Analysis
Let's consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  2
  2 3
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  1 1
  ```
- **Explanation**: 
  - Total bet = 1 + 1 = 2.
  - If the first outcome wins, return = 2 * 1 = 2 (not more than the total bet).
  - If the second outcome wins, return = 3 * 1 = 3 (more than the total bet).
  - This distribution does not satisfy the requirement that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

However, the program does not guarantee that the bets will be 1 for each outcome. Instead, it calculates the bets based on the product and GCD, which might not always result in 1 for each outcome. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion
The program's logic is correct based on the problem requirements. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` correctly checks if the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the condition and the logic.

**Final: True**
