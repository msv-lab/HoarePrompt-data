You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is unchanged, `hcf` is the GCD of `t` and all multipliers `k_i` from all test cases, `num` is the last multiplier from the last test case.
    return hcf
    #The program returns `hcf`, which is the GCD of `t` and all multipliers `k_i` from all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_i`. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `t` and all the integers `k_i` from all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all cases. Specifically, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is incorrect. The sum of the bets should be strictly less than the minimum return for any winning outcome, which is `min(k[i] * c[i])` for all `i`. The current condition does not ensure this.

Let's consider a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
2
2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1 1
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
- If you bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total bet is 2 coins.
- If the first outcome wins, you get 2 * 1 = 2 coins back, which is not more than the total bet.
- If the second outcome wins, you get 3 * 1 = 3 coins back, which is more than the total bet.
- This distribution does not satisfy the requirement that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

However, the provided program might output something like:
```
1 1
```
But upon checking the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:`, it might incorrectly determine that this is a valid distribution because `sum(c) = 2` and `m / hcf` might not be correctly calculated to ensure the strict inequality.

Let's look at the specific logic:
- `m` is the product of all `k[i]`.
- `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`.
- The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is incorrect because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

A correct approach would be to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the minimum return for any winning outcome, which can be achieved by setting each `c[i]` to 1 and checking if the total bet is less than the minimum `k[i]`.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect.
