The value of `x` is reassigned to the value of the input integer. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `y` is still described as `x - 1` but `x` has been updated. Therefore, `y` would now be the new value of `x` minus 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the new value of `x` - 1**.
