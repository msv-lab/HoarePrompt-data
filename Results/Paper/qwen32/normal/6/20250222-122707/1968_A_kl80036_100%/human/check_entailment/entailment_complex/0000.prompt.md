Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: - After all `t` iterations, `i` will have taken on all values from 0 to `t-1`.
    #   - Each `x` will be an input integer for each iteration.
    #   - Each `y` will be `x - 1` for each iteration, and each `y` will have been printed.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, there is no specific final state for `i`, `x`, and `y` because `i` will have completed its range from 0 to `t-1`, and `x` and `y` will have been re-assigned in each iteration based on the input values.
    #
    #However, the output state of the program can be described as the collection of all printed `y` values, one for each test case.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `x` and prints `x - 1`.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
