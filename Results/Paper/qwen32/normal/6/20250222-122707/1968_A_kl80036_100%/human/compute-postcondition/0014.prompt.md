You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: - After all `t` iterations, `i` will have taken on all values from 0 to `t-1`.
    #   - Each `x` will be an input integer for each iteration.
    #   - Each `y` will be `x - 1` for each iteration, and each `y` will have been printed.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, there is no specific final state for `i`, `x`, and `y` because `i` will have completed its range from 0 to `t-1`, and `x` and `y` will have been re-assigned in each iteration based on the input values.
    #
    #However, the output state of the program can be described as the collection of all printed `y` values, one for each test case.
    #
    #### Output State:
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each of the following `t` lines, it receives an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000). The function returns a value for each `x` based on some unspecified criteria (not detailed here).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
