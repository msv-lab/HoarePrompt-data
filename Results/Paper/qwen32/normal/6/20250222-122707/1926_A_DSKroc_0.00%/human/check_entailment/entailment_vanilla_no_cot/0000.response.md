Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error. The `if ac > bc: print('A') else: print('B')` statement is outside the loop that iterates over each test case, which means it will only compare the counts of 'A' and 'B' from the last test case. Instead, this comparison should be made inside the loop for each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

# Call the function if needed
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the comparison and the print statement are inside the loop, ensuring that each test case is handled independently.
