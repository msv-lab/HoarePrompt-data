You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a distinct string of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' and prints 'A' if 'A' appears more times, otherwise it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in each of the given strings of length 5. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program.

The `if ac > bc:` comparison and the corresponding print statements are outside of the loop that processes each test case. As a result, the program only compares the counts from the last test case and prints the result for all test cases, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would be to move the comparison and print statements inside the loop that processes each test case, so that the result for each test case is printed individually.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

func()
```

Given the original program, it does not correctly handle multiple test cases as intended by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
