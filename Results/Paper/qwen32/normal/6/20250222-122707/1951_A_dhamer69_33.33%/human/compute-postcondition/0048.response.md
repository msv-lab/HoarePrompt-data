Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; if `n` is 2, `s` remains '00' if it was '00', otherwise `s` is not equal to '00'; if `n` is not 2, the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11"; `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`. The value of `count_1` either remains unchanged or is unchanged, depending on whether the number of '1's in `s` is odd or even.**
