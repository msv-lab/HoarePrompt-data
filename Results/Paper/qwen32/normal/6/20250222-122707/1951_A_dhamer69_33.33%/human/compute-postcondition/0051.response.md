Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 0; no further iterations of the loop will occur.**

In simpler terms: The loop has finished executing all its iterations because the variable `t` has been decremented to 0. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged from the initial state, and no more input values will be processed by the loop.
