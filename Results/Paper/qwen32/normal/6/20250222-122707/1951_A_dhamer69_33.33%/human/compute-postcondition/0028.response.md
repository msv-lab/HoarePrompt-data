Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be at least 2; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is the string '00', `s` remains '00'. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, it remains odd. If `count_1` is even, it remains even, and the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11".**
