Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of user input. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is the string '00', `s` remains '00'. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, it remains odd. If `count_1` is even, it remains even, and the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11".**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
