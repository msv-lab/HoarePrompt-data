Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `s` is the value of user input.
- `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`, and `count_1` is even.
- The number of occurrences of the substring '11' in the string `s` is not equal to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `'YES'` and is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
