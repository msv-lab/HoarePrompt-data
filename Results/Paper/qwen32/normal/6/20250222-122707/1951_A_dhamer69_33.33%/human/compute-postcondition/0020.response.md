Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is the value of user input; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, then `count_1` remains odd. If `count_1` is even, then `count_1` remains even and the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11".**
