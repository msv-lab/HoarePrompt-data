Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is the value of user input; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`, and `count_1` is even. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring "11", then the string `s` has exactly one occurrence of "11". Otherwise, the string `s` does not have exactly one occurrence of "11".**
