The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `t` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input**
