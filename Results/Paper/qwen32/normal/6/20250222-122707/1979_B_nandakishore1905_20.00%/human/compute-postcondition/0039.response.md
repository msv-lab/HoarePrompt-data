The code snippet calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k`, where `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The variable `p` is assigned this length. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`, `p` is the length of `l`.**
