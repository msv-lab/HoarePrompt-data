The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` and prints a specific value based on certain conditions: if `k` is a power of two, it prints `k`; if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1; if `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints `k` minus the largest power of two less than or equal to `k`.
