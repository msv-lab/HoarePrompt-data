You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` and prints a specific value based on certain conditions: if `k` is a power of two, it prints `k`; if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1; if `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints `k` minus the largest power of two less than or equal to `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it meets the problem description for all potential cases. The problem requires finding the length of the longest common subsegment of two infinite sequences \( a \) and \( b \) defined by:

\[ a_n = n \oplus x \]
\[ b_n = n \oplus y \]

The provided program attempts to solve this problem using the following logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)
```

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Calculate \( k = |n - m| \)**: This is the absolute difference between \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Check if \( k \) is a power of 2**:
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2, the condition \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \) will be true.
   - If true, the program prints \( k \).

3. **Special cases when \( n = 0 \)**:
   - If \( n = 0 \) and \( m \) is odd, it prints 1.
   - If \( n = 0 \) and \( m \) is even, it prints 2.

4. **General case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it calculates the length of the binary representation of \( k \) (excluding the '0b' prefix), then computes \( q = 2^{(\text{length of binary} - 1)} \), and finally prints \( k - q \).

Let's test the logic with some examples:

### Test Case 1:
- Input: \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \)
- \( k = |0 - 1| = 1 \)
- \( k \) is a power of 2, so it prints 1.
- This matches the expected output.

### Test Case 2:
- Input: \( x = 12 \), \( y = 4 \)
- \( k = |12 - 4| = 8 \)
- \( k \) is a power of 2, so it prints 8.
- This matches the expected output.

### Test Case 3:
- Input: \( x = 57 \), \( y = 37 \)
- \( k = |57 - 37| = 20 \)
- \( k \) is not a power of 2.
- Binary representation of 20 is `10100`.
- Length of binary representation is 5.
- \( q = 2^{(5-1)} = 16 \).
- \( k - q = 20 - 16 = 4 \).
- This matches the expected output.

### Test Case 4:
- Input: \( x = 316560849 \), \( y = 14570961 \)
- \( k = |316560849 - 14570961| = 301989888 \)
- \( k \) is not a power of 2.
- Binary representation of 301989888 is `10010000010000000000000000000`.
- Length of binary representation is 29.
- \( q = 2^{(29-1)} = 268435456 \).
- \( k - q = 301989888 - 268435456 = 33554432 \).
- This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly handle the given test cases. However, to ensure correctness for all potential cases, we need to verify if the logic covers all edge cases and scenarios. The logic used in the program appears to be derived from the properties of XOR and binary numbers, which are consistent with the problem description.

Given that the program correctly handles the provided examples and the logic appears to be sound, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
