The code converts the integer `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the new variable `l` is assigned the binary string representation of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`.**
