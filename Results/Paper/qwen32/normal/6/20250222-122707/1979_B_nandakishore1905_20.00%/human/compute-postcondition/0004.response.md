Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
- `k` is a power of 2.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print(k)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `k`. From the precondition, we know that `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and that `k` is a power of 2. Therefore, the value of `k` will be one of the following: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, etc., up to the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the maximum possible value of \(|n - m|\).

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we know that `k` will be a power of 2 based on the given conditions.

Thus, the output will be the value of `k`, which is a power of 2.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2)**
