The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, and the input for the number of iterations must be greater than 0. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will hold the values of the two integers read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, and `m` is the second integer read from the input.**
