The function `func` accepts two distinct non-negative integer parameters, `x` and `y`, such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9. Additionally, the function is called `t` times, where `t` is an integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, the function returns the smaller of the two integers `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` for each of `t` test cases, and returns the smaller of the two integers for each case.**
