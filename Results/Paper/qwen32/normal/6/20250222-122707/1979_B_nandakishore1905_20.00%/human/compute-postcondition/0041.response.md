To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., `k = abs(n - m)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (The value of `i` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task).
- `l` is the binary string representation of `k`.
- `p` is the length of the binary string `l`.
- `q` is set to the integer value `2`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(k - q)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Calculate `k`**: `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. So, `k = abs(n - m)`.
2. **Calculate `l`**: `l` is the binary string representation of `k`. For example, if `k` is 5, then `l` would be `'101'`.
3. **Calculate `p`**: `p` is the length of the binary string `l`. For example, if `l` is `'101'`, then `p` would be 3.
4. **Value of `q`**: `q` is explicitly set to `2`.

The `print` statement outputs `k - q`.

### Output Description:
- `k` is `abs(n - m)`.
- `q` is `2`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the result of subtracting `2` from `abs(n - m)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **k - 2 (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
