Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` and `m` are two integers read from the input.
3. `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., `k = abs(n - m)`.
4. `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not directly used in the print statement, this information is provided).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- The print statement will output the value of `k`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `k`.

### Output:
Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
