Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, the program does nothing. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, the program also does nothing. Otherwise, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (`p - 1`).**
