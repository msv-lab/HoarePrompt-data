The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable that we do not intend to use) and `t`. Since `_` is not used within the loop body, the only state we need to adjust is `t`.

Given that the loop will execute `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1, as each iteration of the loop reduces the value of `t` by 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

At the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
