The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`. This means that the previous value of `nums` (which was a list of integers sorted in descending order) is replaced by a new list of integers derived from the input.

The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is a new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input.**
