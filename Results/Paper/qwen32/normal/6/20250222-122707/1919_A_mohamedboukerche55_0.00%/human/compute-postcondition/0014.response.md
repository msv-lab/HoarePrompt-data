The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'bob  '`.

Let's break down the initial state and the code:

- `i` is assigned the value `t`. However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `s` is the last string input. The exact value of `s` is not needed for this print statement.
- `a` is the first integer from the last string input `s`. The exact value of `a` is not needed for this print statement.
- `b` is the second integer from the last string input `s`. The exact value of `b` is not needed for this print statement.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is even. This condition is not relevant to the print statement.

The `print` statement in the code is:
```python
print('bob  ')
```
This statement directly prints the string `'bob  '`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:
Output: **bob**
