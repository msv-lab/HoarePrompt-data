You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `i` is `t`, `s` is the last string input, `a` is the first integer from the last string input, and `b` is the second integer from the last string input.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `i` is `t`, `s` is the last string input, `a` is the first integer from the last string input, and `b` is the second integer from the last string input. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing coins from their wallets. The key strategic decisions involve choosing whether to swap wallets or not. The player unable to make a move loses.

The outcome of the game can be determined by the total number of coins (a + b):
- If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) wins.
- If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) wins.

This is because:
- If the total number of coins is even, each player can mirror the other's moves, ensuring that Bob will always make the last move.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always ensure she makes the last move by playing optimally.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input and processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
3. It checks if the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd.
4. It prints "bob" if the sum is even, and "alice" if the sum is odd.

However, there is a critical issue in the program:
- The `if` and `else` statements are placed outside the loop, meaning they will only be executed after the last test case has been read. This results in the program only printing the result for the last test case, not for each test case.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis above, the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. It only outputs the result for the last test case, which is incorrect according to the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program incorrectly handles multiple test cases by placing the `if` and `else` statements outside the loop, resulting in only the last test case's result being printed.
Correctness: **False**
