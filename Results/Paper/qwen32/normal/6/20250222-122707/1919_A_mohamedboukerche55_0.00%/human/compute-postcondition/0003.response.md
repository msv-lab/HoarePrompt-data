The code splits the string `s` into a list of words, then converts the second word (at index 1) to an integer and assigns it to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first word in `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second word in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first word in `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second word in `s`.**
