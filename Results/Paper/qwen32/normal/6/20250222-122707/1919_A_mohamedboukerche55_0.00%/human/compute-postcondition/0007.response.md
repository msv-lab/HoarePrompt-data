The code snippet `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` will update the value of `b` to be the integer value of the second word in the string `s`. The values of `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the new string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first word in the original `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second word in the updated `s`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The string `s` remains the same, `a` retains its value as the integer value of the first word in the original `s`, `b` is now updated to be the integer value of the second word in the string `s`, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
