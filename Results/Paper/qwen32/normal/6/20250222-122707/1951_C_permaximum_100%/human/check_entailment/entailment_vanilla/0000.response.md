### Reasoning:

The given program follows a greedy approach to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day `m`, and the total number of tickets `k` to be bought.
   - It also reads the list of prices `prices` for each day.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The program creates a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` where each element is a tuple containing the price and the day index. This allows the program to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program initializes `total_cost` to 0, `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration:
     - It pops the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
     - It adds the `price_increase` to the price to account for the increased prices due to previous purchases.
     - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day, which is the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
     - It adds the cost of these tickets to `total_cost`.
     - It increments `tickets_bought` by the number of tickets bought on the current day.
     - It increases `price_increase` by the number of tickets bought on the current day, as this will increase the price of tickets on subsequent days.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the `total_cost`, which is the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

### Correctness:

The greedy approach ensures that the program always buys tickets from the day with the lowest current price, which is optimal because it minimizes the cost at each step. The use of a priority queue allows the program to efficiently find and update the lowest current price.

However, there is a critical issue with the provided program: it does not correctly handle the fact that the prices for subsequent days should be updated after each purchase. The current implementation updates the `price_increase` but does not reinsert the updated price back into the heap. This means that the heap does not reflect the correct prices for subsequent days after a purchase, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, after each purchase, the program should reinsert the updated price back into the heap. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        if tickets_bought < k:
            heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[day] + price_increase, day))
    return total_cost
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
