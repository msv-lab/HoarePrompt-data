The code snippet only initializes the variable `price_increase` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**
