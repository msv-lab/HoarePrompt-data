Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples with one less element than before, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought) and must be such that `2 * tickets_to_buy < k`. `price_increase` is updated to `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. The variable `pq` has had its smallest element removed, and `price` and `day` have been updated to the price and index of that smallest element. `price` is now `price + price_increase`. `tickets_to_buy` is updated to min(m, k - tickets_bought).**

Natural language: The `total_cost` has been updated by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy` to it. All other variables retain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
