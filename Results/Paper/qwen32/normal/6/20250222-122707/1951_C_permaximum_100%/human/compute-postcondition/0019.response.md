To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `tickets_bought < k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `tickets_bought` is `4 * tickets_to_buy` and must be less than `k`.
- `k` is a constant and does not need to be adjusted.
- `tickets_to_buy` is calculated as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` and must satisfy `2 * tickets_to_buy < k`.

Since `tickets_bought` is derived from `tickets_to_buy`, and `tickets_to_buy` is constrained by `k`, the primary variable we need to adjust to ensure the loop can execute one more time is `tickets_bought`.

To ensure the loop can execute again:
- `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`.
- Since `tickets_bought` is `4 * tickets_to_buy`, we need to ensure `4 * tickets_to_buy < k`.

Given that `tickets_to_buy` is calculated as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, we need to ensure that `tickets_bought` is not yet equal to or greater than `k`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `tickets_bought` is less than `k`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples with one less element than before, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `4 * tickets_to_buy` and must be less than `k`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought) and must be such that `2 * tickets_to_buy < k`. `price_increase` is updated to `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`.** 

Since `tickets_bought` must be less than `k` for the loop to continue, we ensure that `tickets_bought` is adjusted to a value that satisfies this condition.
