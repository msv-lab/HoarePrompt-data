The code snippet `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` removes the smallest element from the heap `pq`, which is a tuple containing a price and its corresponding index. This operation modifies the heap `pq` by removing the smallest element. The variables `price` and `day` are assigned the values from the popped tuple.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, with the smallest element removed. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`.**
