Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples with one less element than before, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is now `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is updated to min(m, k - tickets_bought).**

In simpler terms, the number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) has been increased by the number of tickets bought in this transaction (`tickets_to_buy`). All other variables remain as they were before, except for `tickets_bought`, which has been updated.
