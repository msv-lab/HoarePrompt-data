The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 50000. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must not be 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be any integer in the range 1 to 50000.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 2**
