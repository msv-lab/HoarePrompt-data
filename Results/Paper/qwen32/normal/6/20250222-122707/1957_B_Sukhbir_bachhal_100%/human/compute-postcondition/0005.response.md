Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which is equivalent to integer division by 2. The new value of `n` is half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer. The values of `k`, `t`, and `position` remain unchanged.
