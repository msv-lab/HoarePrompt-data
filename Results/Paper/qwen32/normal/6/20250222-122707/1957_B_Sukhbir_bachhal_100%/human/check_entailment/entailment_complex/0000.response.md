### Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers. Let's break down the logic and see if it meets the problem's requirements.

**Program Analysis:**
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   
2. **Logic for `n > 1`:**
   - It calculates `counter` using `func_1(k)`, which returns the bit length of `k` minus one.
   - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with the same bit length as `k` but with all bits set to 1.
   - The next number appended to `arr` is `k - arr[-1]`, which ensures the sum of the numbers in `arr` equals `k`.
   - The remaining `n - 2` positions in `arr` are filled with 0s.
   
3. **Logic for `n == 1`:**
   - It simply appends `k` to `arr` since there's only one number to print.

4. **Function `func_1(n)`:**
   - This function calculates the bit length of `n` minus one. It does this by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts. This count is the bit length of `n` minus one.

**Correctness Evaluation:**
- **Sum Condition:** The sum of the numbers in `arr` is ensured to be `k` because the first two numbers added to `arr` are `2 ** counter - 1` and `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, which sum to `k`.
- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
  - For `n > 1`, the strategy is to have one number with the maximum possible number of 1s in its binary representation (i.e., `2 ** counter - 1`), and the rest of the numbers are 0s except for the second number which ensures the sum is `k`. This strategy maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR because the bitwise OR of `2 ** counter - 1` with any other number (including 0) will still have the same number of 1s as `2 ** counter - 1`.
  - For `n == 1`, the only number is `k`, and there's no other way to distribute the sum to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to satisfy both conditions of the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
