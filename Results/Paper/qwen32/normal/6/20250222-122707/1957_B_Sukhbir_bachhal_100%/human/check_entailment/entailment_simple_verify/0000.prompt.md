You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
   - The sum of the sequence is `k`.
   - The number of 1s in the binary representation of `a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n` (bitwise OR of all elements) is maximized.

2. Input:
   - The first line contains a single integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`.

3. Output:
   - For each test case, output a sequence of `n` integers that satisfy the conditions.

### Program Analysis:

The program provided is as follows:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
```

#### Key Points:
1. **`func_1(n)`**: This function calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. It returns the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of `n`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If `n > 1`, it constructs a sequence where:
     - The first element is `2 ** counter - 1` (a number with all bits set up to the highest bit of `k`).
     - The second element is `k - arr[-1]`.
     - The rest of the elements are `0`.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply outputs `k`.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's check if this logic meets the problem requirements for all potential cases.

#### Case 1: `n == 1`
- The program correctly outputs `k` as the only element in the sequence, which trivially satisfies the conditions.

#### Case 2: `n > 1`
- The program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
- It does this by setting the first element to `2 ** counter - 1`, which is a number with all bits set up to the highest bit of `k`.
- The second element is set to `k - arr[-1]`, which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
- The remaining elements are set to `0`, which does not affect the bitwise OR.

### Edge Cases:
- **All 1s in Binary Representation**:
  - If `k` is a power of 2 (e.g., `k = 8`), `2 ** counter - 1` will be `7` (binary `111`), and the remaining elements will be `0`s.
  - This will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

- **General Case**:
  - For any `k`, the program sets the first element to the largest number with all bits set up to the highest bit of `k`.
  - This ensures that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of 1s possible for the given `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all potential cases and edge cases as per the problem description. It constructs a sequence that satisfies the conditions for both `n == 1` and `n > 1`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly constructs a sequence of non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. It handles both cases (`n == 1` and `n > 1`) appropriately.
