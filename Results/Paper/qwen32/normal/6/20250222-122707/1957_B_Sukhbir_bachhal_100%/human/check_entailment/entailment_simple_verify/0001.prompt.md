You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)

        position += 1
    return position - 1

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Handling Single Element Case (n == 1):**
   - If `n` is 1, the only possible sequence is `[k]` itself. This is correct since there is only one number and it must equal `k`.

3. **Handling Multiple Elements Case (n > 1):**
   - The program uses a function `func_1(k)` to determine the position of the highest set bit in `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence as follows:
     - The first element is `2 ** counter - 1`, where `counter` is the result from `func_1(k)`. This number has all bits set to 1 up to the highest set bit of `k`.
     - The second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, which ensures the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
     - The remaining `n-2` elements are all `0`.

4. **Function `func_1(n)`:**
   - This function calculates the position of the highest set bit in `n`. It does this by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The position returned is `position - 1`, which correctly gives the position of the highest set bit (0-indexed).

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Single Element Case:** When `n == 1`, the sequence `[k]` is the only possible solution, and the program correctly outputs `k`.
- **Multiple Elements Case:** The program's approach for `n > 1` is flawed. The idea is to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. However, the current approach does not guarantee this:
  - By setting the first element to `2 ** counter - 1` and the second element to `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, the program ensures the sum is `k`, but it does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
  - For example, in the test case `2 5`, the program outputs `3 2`, which results in `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), but a better solution would be `1 4` or `4 1`, both of which result in `1 | 4 = 5` (binary `101`), maximizing the number of 1s to 3.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
