Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 25000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `position` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.
