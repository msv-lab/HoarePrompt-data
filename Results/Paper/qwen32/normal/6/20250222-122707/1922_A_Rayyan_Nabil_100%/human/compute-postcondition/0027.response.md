Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the last user input, `a` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing 1 element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**

### Explanation:
The loop iterates over the `results` list, which contains the results of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. According to the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we see that the loop only executes once because the `results` list contains only one element. Therefore, the loop does not execute more than once, and the final state remains the same as after the first iteration. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `t` remains 1. The `results` list contains one element, which is the result of the single call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
