The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contains one element, after the execution, `results` will contain two elements: the original result and the new result from `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the new integer value of the user input, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` called twice.**
