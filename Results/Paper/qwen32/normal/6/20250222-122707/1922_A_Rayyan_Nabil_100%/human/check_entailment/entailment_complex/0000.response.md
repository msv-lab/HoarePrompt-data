### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented by `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem statement.

**Problem Statement Recap:**
- We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - String `c` does not match the template `t`.

**Template Matching Conditions:**
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be the same as the i-th letter of `t`.
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of `t`.

**Logic Analysis:**
For `func_1` to correctly determine if there exists a template `t`:
- We need to check each position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- We need to determine if we can construct a template `t` such that:
  - `a[i]` and `b[i]` either both match the template at position `i` or can be made to match with an appropriate template character.
  - `c[i]` does not match the template at position `i`.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` simplifies the condition to:
- If `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, it returns 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

This logic is not fully correct because:
- It does not ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` can be made to match the same template character at position `i`.
- It does not ensure that `c[i]` cannot match any possible template character at position `i`.

For example, consider the case where `a[i] = 'a'`, `b[i] = 'b'`, and `c[i] = 'a'`:
- The current logic would return 'YES' because `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
- However, there is no single template character that can satisfy both `a[i]` and `b[i]` matching while `c[i]` not matching.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

**Correctness: False**
