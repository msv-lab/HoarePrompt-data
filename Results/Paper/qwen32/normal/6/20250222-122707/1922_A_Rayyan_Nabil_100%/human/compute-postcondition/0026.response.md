Let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is the integer value of the last user input.
- `a` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input.
- `b` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input.
- `c` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input.
- `t` is 1.
- `results` is a list containing 2 elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `result`**:
   - The variable `result` is not defined in the initial state. It is different from the list `results`.
   - Since `result` is not defined, this will lead to a `NameError` when the print statement is executed.

### Conclusion:
Given that `result` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError`. However, since the task is to describe what would be printed based on the provided initial state, we must assume there is a typo or missing information. If we assume the intention was to print `results` instead of `result`, then the output would be the contents of the `results` list.

### Output Based on Assumption:
Since `results` is a list containing 2 elements, the output would be those 2 elements.

Output: **results (where results is a list containing 2 elements)**

If we strictly adhere to the given code and initial state without making assumptions, the output would be an error. However, based on the context and typical expectations, we assume the intention was to print `results`.

Output: **results (where results is a list containing 2 elements)**
