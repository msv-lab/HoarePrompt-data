Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. However, this does not ensure that for all positions, `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

To correctly solve the problem, for each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, we need to ensure that:
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of that letter.
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be the uppercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
- In all cases, `c[i]` must not match the template at position `i`.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            # If a[i] == b[i], they must be different from c[i] in the template
            if c[i] == a[i]:
                return 'NO'
        else:
            # If a[i] != b[i], at least one of them must be different from c[i] in the template
            if c[i] == a[i] and c[i] == b[i]:
                return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This logic ensures that we can construct a template that satisfies the conditions for all positions.
