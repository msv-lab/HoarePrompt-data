To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet `results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))`. The code calls a function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and appends the result of this function call to the list `results`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are all defined, and `results` is an empty list. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact value that will be returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. However, we can denote the returned value by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` as `result_value`.

The only variable that changes in the output state is `results`, which now contains one element: `result_value`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the user input, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
