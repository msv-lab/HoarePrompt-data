Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

The correct logic should be to check if, for each position `i`, the conditions for the template can be satisfied:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` can be either the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `c[i]` must not match the chosen template character.

Here is a counterexample where the provided program fails:

Input:
```
1
2
ab
ba
aa
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- For the first character, `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'b'`. We can choose the template character as 'A' (uppercase 'a'), so `a[0]` and `b[0]` match the template, but `c[0] = 'a'` does not.
- For the second character, `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'a'`. We can choose the template character as 'B' (uppercase 'b'), so `a[1]` and `b[1]` match the template, but `c[1] = 'a'` does not.

However, the provided program will return "NO" for this input because it only checks if there is at least one position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not the correct condition to determine the existence of a valid template.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case, and the Correctness is **False**.
