Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is `n / 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to `n / 3`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as given in the initial state.
