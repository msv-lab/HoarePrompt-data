The value of `countmins` is updated to `count - 1`. Given that `count` is 4, `countmins` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be greater than 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + 2 * n / 9`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `n / 3 - 2`**.
