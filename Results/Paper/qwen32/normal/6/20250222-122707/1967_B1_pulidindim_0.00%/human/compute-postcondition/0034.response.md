The value of `count` is explicitly set to 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `count` is 2, `ans` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.**
