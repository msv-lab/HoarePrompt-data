`n` and `m` are assigned the values of the two integers provided by the input, separated by a space. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, and `m` is the second input integer.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer**.
