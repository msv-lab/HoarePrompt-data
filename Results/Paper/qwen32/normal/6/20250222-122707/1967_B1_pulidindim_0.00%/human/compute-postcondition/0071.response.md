Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is the first input integer, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`, and `g` is less than `countmins`. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

The values of all variables remain unchanged except for the control flow, which breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
