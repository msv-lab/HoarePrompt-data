Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new state after the execution of the code. The code snippet is `g -= countmins`, which means we subtract the value of `countmins` from `g`.

Initial State: 
- `t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` must be at least 4
- `count` is 3
- `ans` is the first integer from the input plus `g / count + 1`
- `countmins` is 2
- `g` is `n / 3`. If `n / 3` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The code snippet `g -= countmins` updates the value of `g` by subtracting `countmins` from it.

Given that `g` is `n / 3` and `countmins` is 2, the new value of `g` will be `n / 3 - 2`.

The output state remains the same for all other variables except for `g`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be at least 4; `count` is 3; `ans` is the first integer from the input plus `g / count + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3 - 2`.**
