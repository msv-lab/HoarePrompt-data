Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
Sasha starts with `a` coins and can place bets with the following rules:
- If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
- If he loses, he loses the entire bet amount `y`.
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
- We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least `n` coins for any `n`.

### Strategy for the Solution:
The key insight is to determine the minimum number of coins `S` that Sasha needs to ensure he can always recover from the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and still be able to continue betting and potentially reaching any number of coins `n`.

The strategy involves:
- Calculating the minimum number of coins `S` that Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from losing `x` times in a row.
- This is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then calculating the minimum initial bet required to ensure he can continue betting after these losses.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Initial Bet**: Start with a bet of `1` coin.
2. **Worst-case Scenario**: For each of the `x` consecutive losses, the bet amount increases in a way that Sasha can still recover.
3. **Calculation**:
   - After the first loss, Sasha needs at least `1 + 1 = 2` coins to bet again.
   - After the second loss, Sasha needs at least `2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1` coins to bet again.
   - This pattern continues for `x` losses.
4. **Check Against Initial Coins**: If Sasha's initial coins `a` are greater than or equal to this calculated minimum `S`, he can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins `S` that Sasha needs by simulating the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and then checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `S`.

Let's break down the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

1. **Initialization**: `s` is initialized to `1`, representing the initial bet.
2. **Loop for `x` Losses**: For each of the `x` losses, the program calculates the new minimum required coins `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`.
3. **Comparison**: Finally, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

### Verification:
The logic in the program correctly simulates the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and calculates the minimum number of coins `S` that Sasha needs. If `a` is greater than or equal to `S`, Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
