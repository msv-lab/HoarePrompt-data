To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variable `s` is calculated for each iteration based on the given values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the following steps occur:
1. `k`, `x`, and `a` are read as integers.
2. `s` is initialized to 1.
3. A nested loop runs `x` times, updating `s` as follows:
   - `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`

Let's analyze the given output states for the first three iterations:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `k = 2`
   - `x = 3`
   - `a` is not specified directly, but we know `s` becomes 15.
   - Calculation:
     - `s = 1`
     - Iteration 1: `s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Iteration 2: `s = 3 + 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7`
     - Iteration 3: `s = 7 + 7 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7 + 7 + 1 = 15`

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The provided formula `s = x * (2k / (k - 1))` does not seem to match the pattern correctly for all values of `k` and `x`. Instead, we need to compute `s` iteratively as described.
   - Let's assume `k`, `x`, and `a` are such that `s` is calculated correctly based on the nested loop.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `k = 3`
   - `x = 5`
   - `a = 1`
   - `s` is calculated as 7.
   - Calculation:
     - `s = 1`
     - Iteration 1: `s = 1 + 1 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
     - Iteration 2: `s = 2 + 2 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`
     - Iteration 3: `s = 4 + 4 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`
     - Iteration 4: `s = 7 + 7 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11`
     - Iteration 5: `s = 11 + 11 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 11 + 5 + 1 = 17`

Given these examples, we can see that `s` is calculated iteratively for each test case. The final output state after all iterations will be a series of "Yes" or "No" based on whether `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated `s` for each test case.

Since the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each of the `t` test cases are not provided, we can only describe the final output state in terms of the results of each iteration.

**Output State: **A series of "Yes" or "No" printed for each of the `t` test cases, where each "Yes" indicates that `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated `s` for that test case, and each "No" indicates that `a` is less than the calculated `s`.**

In natural language, the final output state will be a list of "Yes" or "No" responses, one for each test case, indicating whether the given `a` is sufficient to meet or exceed the calculated `s` value after the nested loop completes for that test case.
