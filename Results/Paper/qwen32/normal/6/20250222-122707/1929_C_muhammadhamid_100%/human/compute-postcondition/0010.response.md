To determine the output of the provided print statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- The variable `s` is set to 15 if `k` is 2 and `x` is 3.

Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `s` is 15 if both `k` and `x` are 2 and 3 respectively. However, the value of `a` is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s` without knowing the value of `a`.

To provide the most precise description possible, we will describe the output in terms of the condition:

- If `a` is greater than or equal to 15, the output will be 'Yes'.
- If `a` is less than 15, the output will be 'No'.

Since the value of `a` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= 15 else 'No' (where s is 15 if k is 2 and x is 3)**
