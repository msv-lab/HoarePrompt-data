To determine the final output state, we need to analyze the loop condition and the provided output states after each iteration.

The loop condition is:
```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
    pass
```

This condition continues to pop elements from `min_heap` as long as the second element of the popped tuple is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given:
- After 1 iteration: `i` is 6, `min_heap` is `[(x, 3)]`, `d` is 2
- After 2 iterations: `i` is 6, `min_heap` is `[(x, 2)]`, `d` is 2
- After 3 iterations: `i` is 6, `min_heap` is `[(x, 2), (y, 1)]`, `d` is 2

Let's compute the condition for each iteration:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `i - (d + 2) = 6 - (2 + 2) = 6 - 4 = 2`
   - The condition is `e[1] <= 2`. Since `min_heap` was `[(x, 3)]`, `heappop(min_heap)` would pop `(x, 3)`.
   - `3 > 2`, so the loop should not have executed, but since it did, it means the heap must have been `[(x, 2)]` or something less than or equal to 2 before the pop.
   
2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `i - (d + 2) = 6 - (2 + 2) = 2`
   - The condition is `e[1] <= 2`. Since `min_heap` was `[(x, 2)]`, `heappop(min_heap)` would pop `(x, 2)`.
   - `2 <= 2`, so the loop executes.
   
3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `i - (d + 2) = 6 - (2 + 2) = 2`
   - The condition is `e[1] <= 2`. Since `min_heap` was `[(x, 2), (y, 1)]`, `heappop(min_heap)` would pop `(y, 1)`.
   - `1 <= 2`, so the loop executes.

After the third iteration, `min_heap` is `[(x, 2)]`. The next iteration would pop `(x, 2)`:
- `i - (d + 2) = 6 - (2 + 2) = 2`
- The condition is `e[1] <= 2`. Since `min_heap` is `[(x, 2)]`, `heappop(min_heap)` would pop `(x, 2)`.
- `2 <= 2`, so the loop executes.
- After popping `(x, 2)`, `min_heap` becomes empty.

Since `min_heap` is now empty, the loop condition cannot be satisfied, and the loop terminates.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 6, `min_heap` is `[]`, `d` is 2.**

In natural language, after all iterations, the value of `i` remains 6, the `min_heap` is empty, and `d` remains 2.
