Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`; `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`; `i` is 0.**

In simpler terms, `total_costs` now contains the sum of the first `k` elements of the `costs` list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
