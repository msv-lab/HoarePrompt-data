Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`; `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of each consecutive `k` elements of `costs` from `costs[0]` to `costs[n-k]`; `i` is `n-k`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every possible group of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. The variable `i` will have the value `n-k`, which is the last index where a group of `k` elements can start in the `costs` list. All other initial variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`) remain unchanged.
