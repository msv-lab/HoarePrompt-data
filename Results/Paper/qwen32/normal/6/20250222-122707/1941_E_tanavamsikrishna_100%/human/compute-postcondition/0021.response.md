To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `d`, and `len(row)`. 

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(d, len(row)):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(row)`, starting from `d`.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[i]` for `i` in the range [1, d-1] is increased by 2 compared to its initial value
- `row[i]` is `e[0] + row[i] + 1`
- `min_heap` is `[(e), (row[i], i)]`
- `d` is less than `len(row)`
- `i` is at least `2d + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value at the start of the next iteration, and it should still be less than `len(row)`.

**Step-by-step adjustment:**
1. Increment `i` by 1.
2. Ensure `i` is still less than `len(row)`.

Since `d` and `len(row)` do not change in the loop head, we do not need to adjust them.

**Adjusted State:**
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- All other variables remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` in the range [1, d-1] is increased by 2 compared to its initial value, `row[i]` is `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `min_heap` is `[(e), (row[i], i)]`, `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is at least `2d + 2`**
