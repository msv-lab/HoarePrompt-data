The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down:
- `i` is currently 0.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
- After the first iteration, `i` will be 1.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with `n` being at least `k`; `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`; `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`; `i` is 1.**
