To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided code, especially `func_1` and `func_2`, and compare them with the function summaries and the original assessment.

### Analysis

#### Problem Requirements:
- **Grid Representation:** The river is represented as a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns where the depth of each cell is given.
- **Bridge Construction:** Rudolf needs to build `k` bridges over consecutive rows.
- **Support Installation:** Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of each row (cost `a_{i,1} + 1` and `a_{i,m} + 1` respectively). The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
- **Objective:** Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Provided Code

**Function `func_1`:**
- Purpose: Calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
- Logic:
  - Initializes the first `d` elements of the row.
  - Uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain point.
  - Iterates through the row starting from the `d`-th element, updating the cost based on the minimum cost found within the last `d+1` elements.
  - Returns the cost for the last column.

**Function `func_2`:**
- Purpose: Calculate the minimum total cost of building bridges over `k` consecutive rows.
- Logic:
  - Reads input values and constructs the grid.
  - Applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
  - Sums the costs of all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.
  - Prints the minimum total cost.

#### Function Summary:
- **Function 2:** Calculates and prints the minimum total cost of building bridges over a series of river rows, considering constraints on the number of consecutive rows (`k`) and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).

### Evaluation

#### Issues in `func_1`:
- **Incorrect Handling of Constraints:** The function does not correctly handle the constraints on the distance `d` between supports. The logic for maintaining the heap and updating the costs does not ensure that the minimum cost is computed accurately.
- **Initialization and Heap Usage:** The initialization of the first `d` elements and the use of the heap do not guarantee that the minimum cost is found. The heap operations do not correctly reflect the requirement that the distance between supports should not exceed `d`.

#### Issues in `func_2`:
- **Summation of Costs:** The function sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum. However, it does not consider the possibility that different choices of supports in each row might lead to a lower total cost. This approach is too simplistic and does not account for the interdependencies between rows.

#### Example of Incorrectness:
- Consider the test case:
  ```
  1
  3 5 2 2
  0 1 2 1 0
  0 2 1 2 0
  0 1 2 1 0
  ```
  - The correct output should be `6` (by placing supports at positions (2, 2) and (3, 2) for the first row, and (1, 2) and (2, 2) for the second row).
  - The provided program might output a different value due to the incorrect logic in `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle certain edge cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final:** **False**
