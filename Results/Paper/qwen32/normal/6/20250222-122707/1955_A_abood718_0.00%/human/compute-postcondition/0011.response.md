Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, and the input value for the range is 1; `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input. Additionally, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. If `A` is an even integer, no additional changes are made to `A`. If `A` is an odd integer, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
