To determine the output of the `print(X)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).
- `i` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not given, so we don't need to consider it for this particular print statement.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, each between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and 1 and 30 (inclusive) respectively.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are three integers read from the input.
- `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

The `print(X)` statement will output the value of `X`. Since `X` is defined as the integer division of `A` by 2, the output will be `A // 2`.

However, the exact value of `A` is not given in the initial state. Therefore, the output will be dependent on the value of `A` that is read from the input.

Output: **X (where X is the integer division of A by 2)**
