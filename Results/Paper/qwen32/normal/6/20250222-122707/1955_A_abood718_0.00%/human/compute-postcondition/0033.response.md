Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` as input and prints a result based on specific conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`; otherwise, it prints `A // 2` followed by `X * C + B` where `X` is `A // 2`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without altering the input values.**
