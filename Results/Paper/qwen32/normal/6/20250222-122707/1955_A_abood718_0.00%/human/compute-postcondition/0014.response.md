The provided code snippet reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input and assigns them to the respective variables. No further operations are specified in the given code snippet, so the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input.**
