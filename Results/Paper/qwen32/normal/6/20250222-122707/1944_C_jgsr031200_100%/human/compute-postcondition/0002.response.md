The given code snippet is `freq[i] += 1`. This line increments the value at index `i` in the `freq` list by 1. 

To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the impact of the code:

- `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
- `freq[i] += 1` implies that there is a list `freq` and an index `i`. The value at `freq[i]` is incremented by 1.

Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `freq` or the value of `i`, we can only describe the change made to `freq[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `freq[i]` is incremented by 1.**
