The code snippet initializes a list named `freq` with `n + 1` zeros. This means the length of the `freq` list will be one more than the length of the input list `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`, where `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
