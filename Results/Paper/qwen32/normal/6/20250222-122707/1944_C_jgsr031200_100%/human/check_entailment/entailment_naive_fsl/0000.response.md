Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the game between Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement. The primary issue is that the function `func_1(arr)` does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to pick elements from the array `a` and append them to `c` or delete them from `a` respectively. Instead, the function directly calculates the MEX of the array `a` after counting the frequency of each element.

To understand why this is incorrect, let's consider the game dynamics:

1. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
2. Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
3. Both players play optimally.

The given code does not simulate the game turns and does not consider the strategic choices of Alice and Bob. It simply counts the frequency of each element and finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `a`. This approach does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob can influence the final MEX by their choices.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
0
```

For the first test case, the code incorrectly outputs `0` instead of `2`. This is because the code does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns, and thus it does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
