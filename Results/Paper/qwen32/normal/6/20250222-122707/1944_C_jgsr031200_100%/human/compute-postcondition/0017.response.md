Let's break down the given information and analyze the state of the program before the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements.
- `n` is at least 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `freq[i]` (which is `freq[0]` since `i` is 0) can be either 0 or `cou` can be 2.
- `cou` can be either 1 or 0.
- If `freq[i]` is 0, `cou` can be either 1 or 0.
- If `cou` is 2, `freq[i]` can be either 0 or any value other than 1.

### Key Points:
- The value of `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- The value of `freq[i]` and `cou` are interdependent but do not affect the value of `i`.

### Analysis:
Since `i` is explicitly set to 0, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
