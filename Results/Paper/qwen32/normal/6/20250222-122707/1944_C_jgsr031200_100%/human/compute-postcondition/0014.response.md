The code snippet increments the variable `cou` by 1. The initial value of `cou` is 0, so after the operation, `cou` becomes 1. The other variables (`freq`, `n`, `i`, and `freq[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `cou` is 1, `n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `freq[i]` is 1.**
