The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `ele`, and `l`) remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `maxi` is updated based on the comparison between `c` and `maxi`. If `c` is greater than `maxi`, then `maxi` takes the value of `c`. Otherwise, `maxi` retains its current value.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is `max(c, maxi)`, and `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
