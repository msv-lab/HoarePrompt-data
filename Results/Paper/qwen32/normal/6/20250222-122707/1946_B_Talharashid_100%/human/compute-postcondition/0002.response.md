The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `l`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The list `l` will contain `n` integers, which are the values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (-10^9 â‰¤ a_i â‰¤ 10^9), `l` is a list containing `n` integers read from the input.**
