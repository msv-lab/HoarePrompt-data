Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the previously processed element, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be its previous value plus the value of `ele`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `l`, and `ele`) remain unchanged.
