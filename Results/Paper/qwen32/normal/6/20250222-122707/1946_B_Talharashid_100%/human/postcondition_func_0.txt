The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the length of an array, an integer `k` representing the number of operations, and an array of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the maximum cumulative sum of non-negative numbers in the array, adjusted by `k` operations, and prints the result modulo 1,000,000,007.
