The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The variables `c`, `maxi`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of `c`, `maxi`, and `i` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers (or 0 if the last number was negative and `c` was reset), `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.
