The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If there are more elements in the list `l`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ele` is the current element being processed, and `c` and `maxi` are updated based on the value of `ele`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` needs to be the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is 0 if `ele` (the previous element) is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`; otherwise, `c` is `c + ele`. `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `c` and `maxi`, and `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
