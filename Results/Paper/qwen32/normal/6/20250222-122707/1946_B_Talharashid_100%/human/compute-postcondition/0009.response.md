Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers with values ranging from -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0. Either `ele` is not less than 0, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**
