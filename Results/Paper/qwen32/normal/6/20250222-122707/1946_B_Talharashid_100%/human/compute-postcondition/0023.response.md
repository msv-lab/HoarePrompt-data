The code snippet updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `l`, `ele`, and the previous value of `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `ele`, `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
