The code snippet `c += ele` increments the variable `c` by the value of `ele`. This means that the new value of `c` will be the sum of its previous value and the value of `ele`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `c` is 0 if `ele` (the previous element) is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`; otherwise, `c` is `c + ele`.
- `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `c` and `maxi`.
- `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.

The only variable affected by the code is `c`, which is updated to `c + ele`. The values of `n`, `k`, `maxi`, and `ele` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
