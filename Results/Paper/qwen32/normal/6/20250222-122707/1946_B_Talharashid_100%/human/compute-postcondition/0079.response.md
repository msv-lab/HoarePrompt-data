The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, and `ele` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `c` and `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
