Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is a list containing `n` integers read from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 1 element. If `ele` is a negative integer and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` and `maxi` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the previously processed element. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `c`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `ele`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
