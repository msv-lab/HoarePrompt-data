Based on the provided initial state and the Python code snippet, we need to determine the updated values of the variables after the code execution.

Initial State:
- `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0 if `ele_next` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele_next`). Otherwise, `c` is `ele_next` and `maxi` is `max(ele_next, 0)`.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, where `ele` is the third element in the list.

The code snippet:
```python
maxi = max(c, maxi)
```

This line updates `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`.

Let's analyze the possible states:

1. If `ele_next` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele_next`):
   - `c` is 0
   - `maxi` is 0
   - After `maxi = max(c, maxi)`, `maxi` remains 0.

2. Otherwise:
   - `c` is `ele_next`
   - `maxi` is `max(ele_next, 0)`
   - After `maxi = max(c, maxi)`, `maxi` remains `max(ele_next, 0)` since `max(ele_next, 0)` is already the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

In both cases, the value of `maxi` remains the same after the execution of the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0 if `ele_next` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele_next`). Otherwise, `c` is `ele_next` and `maxi` is `max(ele_next, 0)`. `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, where `ele` is the third element in the list.**
