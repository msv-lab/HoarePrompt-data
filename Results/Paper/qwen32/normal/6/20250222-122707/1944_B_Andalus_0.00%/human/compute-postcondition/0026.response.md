The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of `lft` is appended to `sng`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `i` is 2, and `sng` contains the element at index 2 of `lft`.**
