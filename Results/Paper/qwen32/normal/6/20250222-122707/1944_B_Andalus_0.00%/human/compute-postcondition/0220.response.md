Postcondition: **`sz` is an integer and `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed. `rdb` is a list with at least 1 element. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to `sz + 2` and if `k - (sz + 2)` is still greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is further updated to `sz + 4`. If `sz + 2` or `sz + 4` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k - sz` was initially less than 2, `sz` remains unchanged.**
