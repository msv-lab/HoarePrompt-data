To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Key Points from the Initial State:
1. **`T`**: An integer greater than 0. (Not directly relevant to the `print` statement)
2. **`n`**: Greater than 1.
3. **`k`**: The second integer from the input.
4. **`a`**: A list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. (Not directly relevant to the `print` statement)
5. **`lst`**: A list of integers from the input.
6. **`lft`**: A sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`.
7. **`rgt`**: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end and must have at least one pair of consecutive identical elements.
8. **`ldb`**: An empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`).
9. **`sng`**: Contains the remaining elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs after printing up to `k` elements.
10. **`rdb`**: Contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively and must have at least one element.
11. **`i`**: Set to `n`.
12. **`elem`**: The next element in `rdb`.
13. **`sz`**: If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next part of the code.

### Analysis:
- The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not move to a new line after the print statement due to `end=' '`.
- `elem` is described as the next element in `rdb`, and `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively.

### Conclusion:
Since `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that appear twice consecutively and `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, the `print` statement will print the same value twice. The exact value of `elem` is not specified, but it is guaranteed to be an element that appears twice consecutively in `rgt`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in rdb, and rdb contains elements in rgt that appear twice consecutively)**
