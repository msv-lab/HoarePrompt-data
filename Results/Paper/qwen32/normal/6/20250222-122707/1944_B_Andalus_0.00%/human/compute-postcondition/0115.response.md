Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is `sz + 1`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the loop or if statement is broken out of, but the values of `sng`, `elem`, `sz`, `rdb`, and `k` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
