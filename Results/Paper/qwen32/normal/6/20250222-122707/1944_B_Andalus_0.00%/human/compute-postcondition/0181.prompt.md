Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0, `all elements up to the point where sz equals k have been printed from sng`, `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, and `i` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is 0, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is a list containing at least one element, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, and `i` is `n-1`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is 0 or 2, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is a list containing at least two elements, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, `i` is `n-1`, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the execution continues; otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is either 0, 2, or 4; all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`; `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element; `T` is greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `k` is the second integer from the input; `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end; `ldb` is a list containing at least two elements; `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position; `i` is `n-1`; `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2. If `k - sz < 2`, `sz` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
