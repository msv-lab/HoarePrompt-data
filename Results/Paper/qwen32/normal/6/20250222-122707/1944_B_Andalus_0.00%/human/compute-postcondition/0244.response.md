The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ldb`. This operation does not affect the values of `sz`, `sng`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, or `rgt`. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the new variable `ldb` with an empty list as its value.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` is an empty list.**
