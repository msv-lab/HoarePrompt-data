Output State: **`sz` is incremented by 1 again, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sng` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1 once more. The variables `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged, and `elem` still holds the next element in `sng`. If the new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement will be broken out of.
