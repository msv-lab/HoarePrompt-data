The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (which is the value provided by the input), and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

The other variables (`sz`, `sng`, `n`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates`; `i` is `k + 1`**
