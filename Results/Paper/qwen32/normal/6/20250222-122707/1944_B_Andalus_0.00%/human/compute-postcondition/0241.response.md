The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `lst`. The initial state does not provide any specific values for `lst`, but it does specify the values of `sz`, `sng`, `n`, and `k`.

The impact of the code on the program is that it creates a new list `lst` containing integers from the input. The values of `sz`, `sng`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
