Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end and must have at least one pair of consecutive identical elements, `ldb` is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`), `sng` contains the remaining elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs after printing up to `k` elements, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively and must have at least one element, `i` is `n`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
