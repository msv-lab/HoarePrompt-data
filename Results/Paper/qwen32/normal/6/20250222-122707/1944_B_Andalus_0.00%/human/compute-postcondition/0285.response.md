To determine the output of the given print statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the context provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`sz`**: This variable is set to 0.
2. **`k`**: This variable is set to a value provided by the input.
3. **`n`**: This variable is set to a value provided by the input.
4. **`lst`**: This is a list of integers provided by the input.
5. **`lft`**: This is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
6. **`rgt`**: This is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`.
7. **`ldb`**: This list contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates and must have at least 1 element.
8. **`rdb`**: This list contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates consecutively.
9. **`sng`**: This list contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates.
10. **`i`**: This variable is set to `n-1`.
11. **`k - sz`**: This is greater than or equal to 2.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Identifying `elem`:
The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state. However, based on typical patterns in such problems, `elem` is likely a variable that holds an element from one of the lists `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, or `sng`. Given the context, `elem` is most likely to be an element from `sng` since the statement mentions that the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed, and the print statement is likely part of a loop that prints elements from `sng`.

### Explanation:
- **`sng`**: This list contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates. Given that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, it implies that there are at least two elements left in `sng` to be printed.
- **`elem`**: This variable likely holds the current element from `sng` that is being processed in the loop.

### Output:
Since `elem` is an element from `sng`, and the print statement prints `elem` twice followed by a space, the output will be the current value of `elem` repeated twice.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the current element from the list `sng`)**
