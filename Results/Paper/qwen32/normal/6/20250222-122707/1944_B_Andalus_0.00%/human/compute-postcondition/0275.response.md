The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `k + 2`. The variable `n` must be greater than 1 and also greater than the current value of `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` must be greater than `k + 2`; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and now also includes `rgt[i]` if the condition `rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]` is true; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates`; `i` is `k + 2`.**
