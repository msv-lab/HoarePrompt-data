Let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `sng` must contain at least one element.
2. `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
3. `sz` is incremented by 1 (`sz = sz + 1`).
4. `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements.
5. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `elem` is the next element in the list `sng`. Since `sng` contains at least one element, `elem` will be that element.
- The `print` statement is set to print `elem` followed by a space (`end=' '`), rather than the default newline.

### Output:
The output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

### Final Answer:
Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list `sng`)**
