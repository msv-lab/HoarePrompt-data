To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `sz` is set to `k` if `k` can be achieved with the number of pairs in `rdb`. Otherwise, `sz` is set to the largest even number less than or equal to `k`.
   - `rdb` is either empty or contains the remaining elements.
   - `sng` is a list of elements to be processed in the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `sng`.
   - For each `elem` in `sng`, it checks if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, the loop breaks.
   - If not, it prints `elem`, increments `sz` by 1, and continues.
   - The loop stops either when `sz` reaches `k` or when all elements in `sng` are processed.

3. **Output States after First 3 Iterations**:
   - After the first iteration: `sz` is incremented by 1, and `elem` is the first element of `sng`.
   - After the second iteration: `sz` is incremented by 1 again, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`.
   - After the third iteration: `sz` is incremented by 1 again, and `elem` is the third element of `sng`.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop will continue until `sz` is no longer less than `k` or all elements in `sng` are processed.
   - If `sng` has fewer than `k` elements, the loop will print all elements of `sng` and `sz` will be incremented by the number of elements in `sng`.
   - If `sng` has `k` or more elements, the loop will print elements until `sz` reaches `k`.

Given the above analysis, the final output state depends on the length of `sng` and the value of `k`.

**Final Output State**:
- If `len(sng) < k`, the loop will print all elements of `sng` and `sz` will be `sz + len(sng)`.
- If `len(sng) >= k`, the loop will print elements until `sz` reaches `k`.

Assuming the loop runs until `sz` is no longer less than `k` (i.e., `sz` reaches `k`), the final state will be:

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, and all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`. `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged.**

If `sng` has fewer than `k` elements, the final state will be:

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `sz + len(sng)`, and all elements of `sng` have been printed. `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Since the problem does not specify the exact length of `sng` relative to `k`, we assume the loop runs until `sz` reaches `k`:

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, and all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`. `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged.**
