The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given that `rdb` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `rdb` will contain the element `rgt[i]`.

Since `i` is 1, `rdb` will now contain the element at index 1 of `rgt`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[1]`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, `i` is 1, and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.**
