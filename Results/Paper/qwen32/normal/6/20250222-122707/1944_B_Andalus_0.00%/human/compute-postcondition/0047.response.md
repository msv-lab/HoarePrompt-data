To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we have the following information:
- `T` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst` with at least one pair of consecutive identical elements.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index n to the end.
- `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft`.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively.
- `i` is `n`.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

However, the variable `elem` is not defined in the given initial state. Since `elem` is not mentioned or defined anywhere, we cannot determine its exact value based on the provided information. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a precise value for what will be printed.

Given the lack of information about `elem`, the most accurate response is to state that the value of `elem` is unknown based on the provided initial state.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an unknown variable)**
