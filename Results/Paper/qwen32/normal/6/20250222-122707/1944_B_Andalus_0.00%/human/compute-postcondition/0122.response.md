The code snippet takes a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and stores them in a list named `lst`. This operation does not affect the variables `sz`, `k`, `rdb`, `T`, `n`, or `sng` directly, except for the fact that `k` was mentioned as the second integer from the input, which is now part of the `lst`.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
