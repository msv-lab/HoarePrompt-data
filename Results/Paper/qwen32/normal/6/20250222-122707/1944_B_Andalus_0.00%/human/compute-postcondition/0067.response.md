To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, end=' ')`, we need to understand the context and the value of `elem` as per the given initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Initial State:**
   - `T` is an integer greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
   - `ldb` is an empty list or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`.
   - `sng` contains at least one element that is in `lft` and is not part of a consecutive pair and is not at the boundaries of such pairs.
   - `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively.
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `sz` is equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Analyzing the `print` Statement:**
   - The statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem` followed by a space, without a newline at the end.
   - The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is presumably defined in the context of a loop or a condition that precedes the `print` statement.

3. **Determining the Value of `elem`:**
   - Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, we need to infer its value based on typical usage patterns in such problems.
   - Typically, `elem` would be an element from one of the lists (`lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `rdb`, etc.) or a variable used in a loop.
   - Without the exact context or loop, we can't determine the exact value of `elem`. However, we can describe it in terms of the lists it could be from.

Given the above analysis, the most precise description we can provide is that `elem` is an element from one of the lists (`lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `rdb`, etc.) or a variable used in a loop.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from one of the lists (lst, lft, rgt, sng, rdb, etc.) or a variable used in a loop)**
