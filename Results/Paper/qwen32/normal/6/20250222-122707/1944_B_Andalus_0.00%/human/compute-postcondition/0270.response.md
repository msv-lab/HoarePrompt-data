The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the current element `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Therefore, the list `rdb` will now contain the element `rgt[i]` at the end of it. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]`; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates`; the current element `rgt[i]` is equal to the previous element `rgt[i - 1]`.**
