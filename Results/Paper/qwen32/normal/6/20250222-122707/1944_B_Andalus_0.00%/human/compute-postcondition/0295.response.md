The code snippet contains a `break` statement, which will exit the nearest enclosing loop. This does not affect the value of `elem` or `ldb` directly. The state of `elem` being "the next element in `ldb`" remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the exit from the loop.

Output State: **`elem` is the next element in `ldb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
