Output State: **`sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `elem` is the subsequent element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `sz`, `k`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
