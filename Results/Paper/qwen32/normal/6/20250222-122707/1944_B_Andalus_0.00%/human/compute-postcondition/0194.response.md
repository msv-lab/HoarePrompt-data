Output State: **`sng` must contain at least two elements, `sz` is 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, and `sz` must be less than `k`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the code execution did not change the values of `sng`, `sz`, or `elem`. The loop or if statement is exited, but all other conditions and variable states remain the same.
