The code snippet `sng = []` reassigns the variable `sng` to a new empty list. This means that any previously stored elements in `sng` are discarded and `sng` is now an empty list. The other variables (`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sng` is an empty list.**
