To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of `elem` and `sz` in relation to `k`.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sz` can be either 0, 2, 4, or it remains unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `rdb` must contain at least two elements.
   - `elem` is the next element in `rdb`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`.

### Key Points:
- The value of `elem` is explicitly stated to be the next element in `rdb`.
- The value of `sz` is not directly relevant to the print statement itself but influences whether the loop continues or breaks.
- The `print` statement will always execute as long as it is not bypassed by a break condition.

### Print Statement:
- `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print `elem` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we can only describe its value based on the precondition. `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, and it will be printed twice.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in the list rdb)**
