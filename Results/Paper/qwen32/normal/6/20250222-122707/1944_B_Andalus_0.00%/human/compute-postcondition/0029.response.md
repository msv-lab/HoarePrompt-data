To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `ldb`, `sng`, and `i` based on the input list `lft`.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. For each iteration:
- If `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, the element `lft[i]` is appended to `ldb`.
- If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, the element `lft[i]` is appended to `sng`.

Since `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in `a` (which includes `lft`), the following scenarios will occur:
- If `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, it means the current element is the second occurrence of some integer, and it gets added to `ldb`.
- If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and also not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, it means the current element is a unique occurrence in the middle of the list, and it gets added to `sng`.

Given the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`, the final state of `ldb` will contain all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft`. The final state of `sng` will contain all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `T` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `k` remains the same as the initial value.
- `a` remains the same as the initial list of 2n integers.
- `lst` remains the same as the initial list of integers.
- `lft` remains the same as the initial sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` remains the same as the initial sorted list of the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
- `ldb` will contain all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft`.
- `rdb` remains an empty list.
- `sng` will contain all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.**
