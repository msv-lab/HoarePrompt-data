The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range `T`. The loop will execute as long as the range `T` has iterations left. Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not affect the state of the loop continuation. The only state we need to adjust is the range `T`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one of its iterations, so `T` would have been decremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `T` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, and all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`. `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged. `T` must be greater than 0**
