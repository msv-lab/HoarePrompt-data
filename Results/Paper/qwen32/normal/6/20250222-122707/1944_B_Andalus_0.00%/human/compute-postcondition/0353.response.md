In this task, the `break` statement is encountered, which will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. The values of the variables `sz`, `rdb`, and `sng` are not altered by the `break` statement, and `elem` is already defined as the next element in `sng` before the `break` statement is executed. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is incremented by 1, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sng` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `sng` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
