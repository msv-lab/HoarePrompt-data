Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 6 characters, `s` is `a[4:7]` if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `s` is `a[2:5]`. If the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 7 and `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 5 and `ans` is 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, taking into account the condition `s == 'map' or s == 'pie'`.
