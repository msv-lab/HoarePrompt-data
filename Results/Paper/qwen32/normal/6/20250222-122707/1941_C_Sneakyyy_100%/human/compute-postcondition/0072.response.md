Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is either 4 or 6 and `ans` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is either 2 or 4 and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
