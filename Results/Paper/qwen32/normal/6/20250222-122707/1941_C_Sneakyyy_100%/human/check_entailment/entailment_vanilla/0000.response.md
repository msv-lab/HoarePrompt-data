Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and checking for the substrings "pie" and "map". However, the approach is flawed because it only checks for these substrings in non-overlapping segments of 3 characters. This means that it may not correctly identify and count all occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map" that can overlap or are not in a sequence of 3 consecutive characters.

For example, consider the string "mapie". The program would only find "map" and not "pie" because after finding "map", it skips the next two characters, thus missing "pie". Therefore, the program would incorrectly return 1 instead of 2 for this string.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that can handle overlapping substrings.

Correctness: **False**
