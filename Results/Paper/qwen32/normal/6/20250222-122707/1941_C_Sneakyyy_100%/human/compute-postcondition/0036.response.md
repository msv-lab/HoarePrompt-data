The code snippet provided increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 characters, `i` is 3, `ans` is 1, `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'**.
