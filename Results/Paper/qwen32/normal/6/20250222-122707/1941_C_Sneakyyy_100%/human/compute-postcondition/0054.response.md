The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's state. The loop iterates based on the integer value from user input, which is `n`. Therefore, the only state that can be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `n`.

Given that the loop runs `n` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 at the start of the loop. However, since `n` is the input value and does not change within the loop, we need to consider the state before the loop starts its next iteration.

Since the loop head does not involve any variables that we can adjust directly within the loop body, the state of `n` should reflect the number of remaining iterations. If the loop has just finished an iteration, `n` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations.

However, the problem statement specifies the state at the end of the previous iteration, and we need to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is the number of iterations left, before the start of the next iteration, `n` should already be decremented.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input minus 1, `a` is the string entered by the user, `i` is `i_final` (the largest multiple of 3 that is less than `len(a)` if the last chunk is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `len(a) - 2`), `ans` is `ans_final` (the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in non-overlapping chunks of 3 characters in the string `a`)**.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is `n - 1`, `a` is the string entered by the user, `i` is `i_final`, `ans` is `ans_final`**.
