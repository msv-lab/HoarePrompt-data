The code snippet assigns the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3 to the variable `s`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `s` will be the first three characters of the string `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string entered by the user with length at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the first three characters of `a`.**
