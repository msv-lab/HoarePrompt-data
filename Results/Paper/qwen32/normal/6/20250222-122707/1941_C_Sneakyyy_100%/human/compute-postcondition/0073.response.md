To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition: `while i < len(a) - 2:`. This condition ensures that there are at least 3 characters remaining in the string `a` starting from index `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string with length greater than 5.
- `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is either 4 or 6 and `ans` is either 1 or 2.
- Otherwise, `i` is either 2 or 4 and `ans` is either 0 or 1.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`. Since `a` has a length greater than 5, `len(a) - 2` is at least 3. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

From the given conditions, `i` can be either 2, 4, or 6. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `i` to a value that is less than `len(a) - 2`. Given the possible values of `i` (2, 4, or 6), we should choose the smallest possible value that still allows the loop to execute, which is 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 2, ensuring that `i < len(a) - 2` is satisfied.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 0 or 1**.
