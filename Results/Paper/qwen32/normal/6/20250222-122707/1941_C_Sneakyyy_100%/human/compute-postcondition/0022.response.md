The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise at least 3, `i` is `i + 3` and must be less than `len(a) - 2`, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
