The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string entered by the user, `i` is `i_final`, `ans` is 0.**
