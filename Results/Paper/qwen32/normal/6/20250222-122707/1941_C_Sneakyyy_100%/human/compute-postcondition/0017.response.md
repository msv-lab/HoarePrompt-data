The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `i` can be either 1 or 3. If `i` was 1, it will become 2. If `i` was 3, it will become 4. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string entered by the user with length at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise `a` has a length at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `ans` is 1 if the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 2 if the original `i` was 1, otherwise `i` is 4.**
