To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variable `ans` is calculated.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output of `print(ans)`.
2. **n**: An input integer. The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is not used in the provided code snippet, so it also doesn't affect the output of `print(ans)`.
3. **a**: A string entered by the user. This is the string in which we need to find the substrings 'map' or 'pie'.
4. **i**: The largest index such that \(i < \text{len(a)} - 2\) after the loop terminates. The exact value of `i` is not directly relevant to the output of `print(ans)`, but it indicates that some kind of loop is iterating over the string `a`.
5. **ans**: The number of times the substring 'map' or 'pie' was found in the string `a`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is described as the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' are found in the string `a`. However, the actual loop or method used to count these substrings is not provided in the code snippet. We can infer that some loop or method iterates over the string `a` and increments `ans` each time it finds either 'map' or 'pie'.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(ans)` statement will output the calculated number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' are found in the string `a`)**
