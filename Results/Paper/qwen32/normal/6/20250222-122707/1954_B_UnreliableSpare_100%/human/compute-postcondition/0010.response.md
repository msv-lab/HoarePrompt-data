Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, and the fact that `i` has been incremented by 1 remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
