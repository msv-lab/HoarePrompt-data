The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either `Decimal('Infinity')` or `0`, and `cnt` is either `1` or `0`.

- If `ans` was `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is `1`, then `ans` becomes `1`.
- If `ans` was `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is `0`, then `ans` becomes `0`.
- If `ans` was `0` and `cnt` is `1`, then `ans` remains `0` (since `0` is less than `1`).
- If `ans` was `0` and `cnt` is `0`, then `ans` remains `0`.

Therefore, the only possible values for `ans` after the execution of the code are `0` or `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0, `i` is 4**.
