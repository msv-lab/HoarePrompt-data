Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove for an array to stop being beautiful. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Logic for Counting Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements of the same value by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements. However, this logic does not correctly address the problem's requirement of making the array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

2. **Handling Uniform Arrays:**
   - The program correctly identifies and outputs `-1` for arrays where all elements are the same, as such arrays are already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation:**
   - The program uses `Decimal('Infinity')` to find the minimum number of consecutive elements of the same value, but this does not account for the correct logic needed to solve the problem. The minimum number of elements to remove should be based on the structure of the array and the operations allowed, not just the length of consecutive elements.

4. **Overall Approach:**
   - The problem requires a different approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. One possible approach is to identify the longest subarray that can be made uniform using the allowed operation and then calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break this subarray.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.
