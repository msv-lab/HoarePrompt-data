You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful.
- An array is "beautiful" if all its elements can be made the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` (where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`) with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
- If it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, the output should be `-1`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Checking if the Array is Uniform:**
   - The program uses a `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` remains `True`), it outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Length of Uniform Subarrays:**
   - The program then tries to find the smallest contiguous subarray of uniform elements in the array.
   - It does this by iterating through the array, counting the length of contiguous subarrays of the same value, and keeping track of the smallest such length using `ans`.
   - The smallest length of a uniform subarray is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array was uniform (`flag` was `True`), it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the smallest length of a uniform subarray (`ans`).

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Uniform Array Case:** If all elements are the same, the program correctly outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.
- **Non-Uniform Array Case:** The program attempts to find the smallest uniform subarray, but this approach is flawed. The smallest uniform subarray does not necessarily determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The smallest uniform subarray is of length `1`, but removing one element is not enough to make the array non-beautiful. The correct answer is `1` (removing any middle `1` or `2`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make a non-uniform array stop being beautiful. The logic for finding the smallest uniform subarray is insufficient.

Correctness: **False**
