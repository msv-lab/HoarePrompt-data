The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended, and `n` remains unchanged.

Given that the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, the `flag` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the `flag` remains True, `i` is incremented by 1**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2** (assuming `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration).

To generalize:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1** (from its value at the end of the previous iteration)
