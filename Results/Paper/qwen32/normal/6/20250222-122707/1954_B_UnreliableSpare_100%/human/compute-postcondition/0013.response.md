The given code snippet initializes a variable `flag` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial state with the addition of `flag` being set to `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `flag` is `False`.**
