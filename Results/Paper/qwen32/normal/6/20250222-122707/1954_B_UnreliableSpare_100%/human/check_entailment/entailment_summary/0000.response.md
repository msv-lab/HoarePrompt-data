### Reasoning:

1. **Identifying if the array is already beautiful and uniform:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. This is done using a flag (`flag = True` initially). It iterates through the array and if it finds any two consecutive elements that are not the same, it sets `flag = False` and breaks the loop.
   - If `flag` remains `True` after the loop, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it outputs `-1` as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Finding the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same:**
   - If the array is not uniform, the program then calculates the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure any valid sequence length will be smaller.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are the same (`cnt`).
   - When it encounters an element different from the current sequence (`val`), it updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, then resets `cnt` to 0 and updates `val` to the new element.
   - After the loop, it does a final check to update `ans` with the last counted sequence length.
   - It prints the value of `ans`, which represents the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same.

### Correctness:

The program correctly identifies whether the array is uniform and outputs `-1` if it is. It also correctly calculates the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same when the array is not uniform. This length represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

However, the program does not consider the possibility of removing elements in such a way that the array stops being beautiful without necessarily removing the shortest sequence of consecutive elements. For example, in an array like `1 2 1 2 1`, removing the middle `2` makes the array `[1 2 1 1]`, which is not beautiful, but the program would output `1` (the shortest sequence length), which is not the correct answer.

The correct approach should involve checking all possible ways to remove elements to ensure the array stops being beautiful, not just finding the shortest sequence of consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
