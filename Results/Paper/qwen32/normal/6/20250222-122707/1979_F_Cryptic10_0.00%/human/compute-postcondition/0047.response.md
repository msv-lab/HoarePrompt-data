Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, and now also includes `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and `v` is no longer in the set; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. The loop or conditional structure is exited.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or conditional structure, but it does not change the values of the variables `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, `u`, or `d`.
