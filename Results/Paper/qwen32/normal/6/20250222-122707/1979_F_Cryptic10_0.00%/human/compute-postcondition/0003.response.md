The only variable in the loop head is `d`, and it is used in the `range` function with parameters `(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means that the loop will iterate from `n - 1` down to `0`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function will generate values from `n - 1` down to `0`. However, the problem statement specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^5, so `n` is already guaranteed to be at least 2, ensuring that the loop will execute.

Since the loop variable `d` is dependent on `n` and the range function, and no other variables in the loop head need adjustment, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n**
