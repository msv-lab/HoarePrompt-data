Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, with `v` appended to it if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `d` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in `remaining_vertices` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` also remains unchanged.**
