The code `path.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the end of the list `path`. Therefore, `path` now contains two elements: the original single element and the newly appended `v`. The values of `n`, `remaining_vertices`, and the precondition that `v` is in `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing two elements, the original vertex and `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0. The current value of `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
