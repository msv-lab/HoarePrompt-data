Output State: **`d` is `d + 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `path` has `v` appended to it; `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the loop or if statement is exited.
