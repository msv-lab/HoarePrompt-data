To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the provided code snippet on the existing variables. The code snippet is:

```python
v, u = func_1(d)
```

This line of code indicates that the function `func_1` is called with the argument `d`, and the function returns two values which are assigned to the variables `v` and `u`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop.
- `d` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

After executing the code snippet, the variables `v` and `u` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The values of `n`, `path`, and `d` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the provided information.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `d` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
