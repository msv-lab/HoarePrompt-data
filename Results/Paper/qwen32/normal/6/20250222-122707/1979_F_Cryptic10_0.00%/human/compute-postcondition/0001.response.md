Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `n` remains a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is still an empty list, and `remaining_vertices` is now a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`.
