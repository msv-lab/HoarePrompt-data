To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
   - `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
   - If `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`.
   - `path` is a list containing the value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it remains an empty list.
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet provided is just `continue`. This statement does not change any variable values; it simply instructs the program to continue with the next iteration of the loop it is in.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - Since `continue` does not perform any operations that modify variables, the values of `n`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - The values of all variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`; if `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`; `path` is a list containing the value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
