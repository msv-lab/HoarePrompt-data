Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is decreased by 1 from its current value; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; If `v` was initially 0, `d` is set to `n - 2`; `path` is a list containing the value of `v` as its last element; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` and `v` itself has been removed from `remaining_vertices`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The value of `d` is decreased by 1. If `v` was initially 0, `d` is set to `n - 2`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
