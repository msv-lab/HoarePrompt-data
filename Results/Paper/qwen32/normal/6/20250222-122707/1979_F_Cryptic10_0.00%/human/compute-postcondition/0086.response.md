Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing all the vertices from the original set of remaining vertices in the order they were added; `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `path` list will contain all the vertices from the original set of `remaining_vertices` in the order they were added to the `path`. The `remaining_vertices` set will be empty because all vertices have been removed from it and added to the `path`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of vertices in the graph.
