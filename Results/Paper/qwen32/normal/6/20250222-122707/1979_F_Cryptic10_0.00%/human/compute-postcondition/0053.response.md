The code appends the value of `v` to the `path` list. The values of `n`, `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and now also `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex; `d` is now `d - 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
