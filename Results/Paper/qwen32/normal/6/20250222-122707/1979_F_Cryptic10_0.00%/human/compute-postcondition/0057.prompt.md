Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one element, which is a vertex from the set of remaining vertices; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex.
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `path` is a list containing one or two elements, the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` now also includes `v` and `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, there is no change to `path` and `remaining_vertices`. The loop or conditional structure is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is now also in `path`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set; `d` is now `d - 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, no additional changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
