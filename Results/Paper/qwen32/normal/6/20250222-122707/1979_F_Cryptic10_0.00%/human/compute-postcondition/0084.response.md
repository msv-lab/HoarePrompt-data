Postcondition: **`d` is `d + 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to `path` and `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` after the operation, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, there is no change to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.**
