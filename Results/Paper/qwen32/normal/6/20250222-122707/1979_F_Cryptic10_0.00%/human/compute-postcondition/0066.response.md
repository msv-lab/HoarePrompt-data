The code `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. Given that `v` is 0, this means that 0 will be removed from `remaining_vertices`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, and now includes `v` (which is 0); `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex but does not include `v` (which is 0); `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current value of `v` is 0 and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`.**
