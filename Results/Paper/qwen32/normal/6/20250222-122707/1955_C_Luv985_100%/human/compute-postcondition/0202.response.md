Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first integer value read from the input; `k` is the remaining value after all possible deductions; `a` is a list of integers with some values reduced to zero; `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left side; `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right side; `ans` is the total count of elements that have been reduced to zero; `l` equals `r`.**
