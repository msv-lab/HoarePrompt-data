Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers, each representing an integer between 1 and 10^9; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers, each representing an integer between 1 and 10^9; `l` and `r` are integers; `ans` is an integer; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi`, and `mi` is recalculated. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is set to `n - 2`, `ans` is set to 2 if `a[0]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 1, and `l` is set to 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, `r` remains `n - 1`, and if `a[0]` is 0, `ans` is set to 1 and `l` is set to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0 and `l` remains 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and `k > 0` minus `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; `a` is a list of `n` integers, where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r` or `l < r - 1` if `a[r] == 0`; `ans` is an integer incremented by 1 if `a[r] == 0` or if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l] == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1; `r` is now `r - 1` if `a[r] == 0`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `mi * 2 > k`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is now `k - mi * 2`; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r - 1` if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `l < r`; if `a[l]` was 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` was 0; `r` is now `r - 1` if `a[r]` was 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is either 0 or 1; `k` remains unchanged; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
