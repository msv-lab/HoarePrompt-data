Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 1; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the modification; if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, or 3; otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2.**
