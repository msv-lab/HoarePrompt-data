The code snippet converts each string in the list `a` to an integer. Therefore, the list `a` will now contain integers instead of strings. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers, each representing an integer between 1 and 10^9.**
