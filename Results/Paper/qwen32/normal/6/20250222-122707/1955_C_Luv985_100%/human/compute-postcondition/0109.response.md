The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `2 * mi`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` has been updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi`; `l` is 1 (if `l` was 0 before) or 2 (if `l` was 1 before) or 0 (if `a[l]` was not 0); `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the modification; `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3.**
