Postcondition: **`t` is 0 or 1 (depending on whether `k` is even or odd); `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`; `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
