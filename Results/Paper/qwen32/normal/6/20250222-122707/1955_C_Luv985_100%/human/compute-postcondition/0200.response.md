Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, and `l` and `r` are set based on the condition `mi * 2 <= k`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decremented by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are reduced by `mi`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r] == 0`, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r] == 0`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`. `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
