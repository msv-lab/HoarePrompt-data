The given `print()` statement is empty, meaning it doesn't contain any arguments to print. In Python, when `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs an empty line.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: The list `a` is mentioned to be printed out, but there is no actual `print(a)` statement in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is set to the length of `a`, but this variable is not used in the provided `print()` statement.
2. **Code Snippet**: The provided code snippet is `print()`, which is an empty `print()` function call.
3. **Execution**: When `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs an empty line.

Given the above points, the output of the `print()` statement will be an empty line.

Output: **(an empty line)**
