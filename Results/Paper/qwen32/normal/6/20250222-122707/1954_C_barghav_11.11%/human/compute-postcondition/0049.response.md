To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop and the given output states after the first few iterations.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')
```

### Observations:
- The loop iterates over the indices of list `b`.
- During each iteration, it prints the element at the current index `i` of list `b` without adding a newline.
- The output states provided indicate the state of the variables after each iteration and the conditions on list `b`.

### Given Output States:
- **After 1 iteration**: 
  - `a` is printed out.
  - `i` is 0 (the initial value at the start of the loop).
  - `b` must have at least one element.

- **After 2 iterations**: 
  - `a` is printed out.
  - `i` is 0 (reset to the start of the loop).
  - `b` must have at least one element.

- **After 3 iterations**: 
  - `a` is printed out.
  - `i` is 1 (the value at the end of the second iteration).
  - `b` must have at least two elements.

### Determining the Final Output State:
- The loop will iterate `len(b)` times.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(b) - 1` (the last index of `b`).
- The list `a` is printed out only once at the beginning, and it is not modified by the loop.
- The loop prints all elements of `b` concatenated together without spaces or newlines.

### Final Output State:
- `a` is printed out once.
- `i` equals `len(b) - 1` after the loop finishes.
- All elements of `b` are printed concatenated together.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **`a` is printed out, `i` equals `len(b) - 1`, and all elements of `b` are printed concatenated together.**
