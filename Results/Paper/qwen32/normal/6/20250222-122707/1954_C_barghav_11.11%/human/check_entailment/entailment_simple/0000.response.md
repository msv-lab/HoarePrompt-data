### Reasoning:

The program is designed to maximize the product of two numbers, `x` and `y`, by swapping corresponding digits between them. However, the strategy implemented in the function `func_1()` does not necessarily maximize the product. The function swaps the first half of the digits in `x` and `y` to be the maximum and minimum, respectively, and the second half to be the minimum and maximum, respectively. This strategy does not guarantee the maximum product.

To illustrate why this strategy is incorrect, consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
73
31
```

**Expected Output:**
```
71
33
```

However, the function `func_1()` will produce:
```
73
31
```

This is because the function swaps the digits in the first half (which is just the first digit in this case) and keeps the second half the same, which does not maximize the product.

A correct approach would be to compare each pair of corresponding digits and swap them if it increases the product. This can be done by iterating over all pairs of digits and making swaps that result in a higher product.

### Correctness:
**False**
