Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string with `a[i]` now equal to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string with `b[i]` now equal to `n`; `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `b[i]` has been updated to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
