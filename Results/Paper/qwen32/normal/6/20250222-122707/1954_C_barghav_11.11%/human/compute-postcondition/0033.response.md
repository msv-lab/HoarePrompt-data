Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters where `a[i]` is updated to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `a[i]` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters where `b[i]` is `n` if `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `b[i]` is `m`; `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`; `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
