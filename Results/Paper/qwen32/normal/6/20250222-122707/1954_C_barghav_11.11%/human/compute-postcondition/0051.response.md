Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 10^100 and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each case. The specific result for each case is not provided in the output description, so the functionality is defined based on the given constraints and the number of test cases.**
