Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

- **Initial State:**
  - `a` is printed out (though `a` is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for this particular print).
  - `i` is 1.
  - `b` must be a list with at least two elements.

- **Print Statement:**
  - `print(b[i], end='')`
  - Here, `i` is 1, so `b[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `b`.

Since `b` is a list with at least two elements, `b[1]` will be the second element of the list `b`. The `end=''` argument in the `print` function means that no newline character will be added at the end of the printed output.

Therefore, the output will be the second element of the list `b` without any additional characters.

Output: **b[1] (where b[1] is the second element of the list b)**
