Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly maximize the product of the numbers `x` and `y`. The logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not consider the overall product but rather makes arbitrary swaps based on the position of the digits.

To maximize the product, for each corresponding pair of digits `(a[i], b[i])`, you should swap them if and only if doing so increases the product. The current implementation swaps digits based on their positions without considering the impact on the product.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x = list(input().strip())
    y = list(input().strip())
    for i in range(len(x)):
        if int(x[i]) < int(y[i]):
            x[i], y[i] = y[i], x[i]
    print(''.join(x))
    print(''.join(y))
```

This version correctly swaps digits only if it increases the product by ensuring that the larger digit is in the first number for each position.
