The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of the variable `suma` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \times (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\), `suma` is `suma + 1`.**

In simpler terms, Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \times (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\), `suma` has been incremented by 1.**
