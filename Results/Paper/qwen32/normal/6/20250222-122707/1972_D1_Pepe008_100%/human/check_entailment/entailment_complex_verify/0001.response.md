### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This can be rephrased as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) \]
for some integer \(k\).

#### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve this problem using the following approach:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases \(T\), and for each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
2. **Loop through \(b\)**: It iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. **Calculate \(x\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula:
   \[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]
   where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
4. **Check Conditions**: It checks if the calculated \(x\) is positive and if certain additional conditions are met (specifically, if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\)).
5. **Sum Calculation**: It sums up the valid \(x\) values and adjusts the sum by subtracting 2 before printing.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used for \(x\) does not correctly reflect the problem's requirement. The program seems to be trying to find a pattern or formula that fits the problem, but it is not clear how this formula is derived or why it is expected to work.
2. **Logic Errors**: The conditions checked within the loop do not align with the problem's requirements. The program does not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, especially when \(a\) or \(b\) are small.

#### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve:
1. Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given bounds.
2. For each pair, calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Counting the number of valid pairs.

#### Annotated Code Analysis

The annotated version of the code does not provide insights into why the formula and logic used are correct or incorrect. It merely states the flow of the program without validating the logic or formula against the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and formula used do not align with the problem's requirements, and there are no clear justifications for these choices in the annotated version.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
