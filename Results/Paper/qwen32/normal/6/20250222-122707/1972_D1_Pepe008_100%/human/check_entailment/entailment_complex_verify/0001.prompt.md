You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Annotated Code: 
import  math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: For each of the T test cases, the output is the value of `suma - 2` after processing the corresponding `a` and `b` values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on these integers and outputs the result minus two.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This can be rephrased as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) \]
for some integer \(k\).

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve this problem using the following approach:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases \(T\), and for each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
2. **Loop through \(b\)**: It iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. **Calculate \(x\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula:
   \[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]
   where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
4. **Check Conditions**: It checks if the calculated \(x\) is positive and if certain additional conditions are met (specifically, if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\)).
5. **Sum Calculation**: It sums up the valid \(x\) values and adjusts the sum by subtracting 2 before printing.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used for \(x\) does not correctly reflect the problem's requirement. The program seems to be trying to find a pattern or formula that fits the problem, but it is not clear how this formula is derived or why it is expected to work.
2. **Logic Errors**: The conditions checked within the loop do not align with the problem's requirements. The program does not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, especially when \(a\) or \(b\) are small.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve:
1. Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given bounds.
2. For each pair, calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Counting the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
