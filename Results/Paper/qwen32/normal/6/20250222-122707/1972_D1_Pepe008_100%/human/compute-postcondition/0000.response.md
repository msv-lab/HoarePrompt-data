The code snippet `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was previously mentioned in the initial state. Other variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is the integer value of `t`, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
