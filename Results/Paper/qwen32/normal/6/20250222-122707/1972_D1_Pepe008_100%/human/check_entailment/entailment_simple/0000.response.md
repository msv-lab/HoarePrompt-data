### Reasoning:

The given annotated program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the code:

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases \(T\), and for each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Logic to Count Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes a variable `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
   - It checks if \(x\) is positive. If it is, it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Additionally, it checks if \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right)\) is an integer and if \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is divisible by \(i^2\). If both conditions are met, it adds 1 to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

However, the provided logic does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The logic to determine valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions is not accurately represented in the code. Specifically, the formula used to calculate \(x\) and the subsequent checks do not correctly reflect the problem's constraints.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
