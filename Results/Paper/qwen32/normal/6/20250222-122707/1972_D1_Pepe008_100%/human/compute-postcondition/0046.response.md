The code calculates the value of `x` based on the given formula and the initial state of the variables. The variables `info`, `t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same in the output state.

The calculation for `x` is as follows:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \times (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

Given:
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `i` is `b + 1`

Therefore, the value of `x` is calculated using the values of `a` and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \times (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\)**.
