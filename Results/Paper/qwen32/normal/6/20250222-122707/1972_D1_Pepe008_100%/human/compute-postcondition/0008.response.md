The code snippet increments the variable `suma` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is already defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, the new value of `suma` will be the old value of `suma` plus `x`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
