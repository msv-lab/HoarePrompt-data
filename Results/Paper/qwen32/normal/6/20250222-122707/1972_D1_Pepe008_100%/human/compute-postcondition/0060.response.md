The code snippet provided adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Therefore, the value of `suma` will change based on the current value of `x`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `suma` is initially 0.
- `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\).

After executing `suma += x`, `suma` will be equal to the value of `x`.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\), `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\)**.
