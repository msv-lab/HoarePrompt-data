The code snippet calculates a new value for `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the calculation of `x`.

Given the initial state, `x` is reassigned the new value calculated by the formula. The values of `info`, `t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**.
