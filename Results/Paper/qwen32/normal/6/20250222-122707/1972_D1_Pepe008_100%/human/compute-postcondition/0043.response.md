Postcondition: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `suma` is `2 * x + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` remains `2 * x`.**
