Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This can be rephrased as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) \]
for some integer \(k\).

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve this problem using the following approach:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases \(T\), and for each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
2. **Loop through \(b\)**: It iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. **Calculate \(x\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula:
   \[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]
   where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
4. **Check Conditions**: It checks if the calculated \(x\) is positive and if certain additional conditions are met (specifically, if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\)).
5. **Sum Calculation**: It sums up the valid \(x\) values and adjusts the sum by subtracting 2 before printing.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used for \(x\) does not correctly reflect the problem's requirement. The program seems to be trying to find a pattern or formula that fits the problem, but it is not clear how this formula is derived or why it is expected to work.
2. **Logic Errors**: The conditions checked within the loop do not align with the problem's requirements. The program does not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, especially when \(a\) or \(b\) are small.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve:
1. Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given bounds.
2. For each pair, calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Counting the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program's logic and formula do not match the problem's requirements.

### Function Summary Evaluation

The function summary provided does not accurately describe the program's behavior in solving the problem. It states that the function processes multiple test cases and calculates a specific value based on the integers `a` and `b`, but the provided code does not correctly implement the problem's logic.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect based on the analysis and the issues identified.
