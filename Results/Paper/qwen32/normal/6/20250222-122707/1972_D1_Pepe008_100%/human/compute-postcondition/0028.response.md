The code snippet `info = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. This means the previous value of `info` is overwritten. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `t`, `T`, and `suma` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the accumulated sum after all iterations of the loop.**
