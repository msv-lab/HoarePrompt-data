The code snippet `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `suma` is initially set to `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` is true, but since `suma` is defined as `x`, we can directly use `x` in the calculation.

So, after the execution of `suma += x`, `suma` will be `x + x`, which is `2 * x`.

The other variables (`info`, `t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is `2 * x`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**.
