The code snippet provided increments the value of `suma` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is `x + 1`, `x` is `(a - b * (b + 1)) // (b + 1)`, and `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i`**.
