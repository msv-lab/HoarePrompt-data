The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. So, for the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its current value. The value of `b` remains the same because it is the upper bound of the loop.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we can deduce that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2` (since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).

The value of `b` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**

However, since `x` is calculated inside the loop and not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust `x` in the state description for the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`**
