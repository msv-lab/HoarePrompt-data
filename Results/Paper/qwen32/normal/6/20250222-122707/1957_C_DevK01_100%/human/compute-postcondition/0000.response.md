The provided code snippet initializes a list `dp` with the values `[1, 1]`. The initial state describes `t`, `n`, `k`, and the subsequent `r_i` and `c_i` values, but these are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `dp` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `dp` is `[1, 1]`.**
