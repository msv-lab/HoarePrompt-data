Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the whitespace-separated values in `a` to integers; `o` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a new input line on whitespace; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b`; `k` equals `n`.**
