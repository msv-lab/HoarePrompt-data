Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is the value of `input()`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in `a` to integers, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line sorted in descending order, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `k` is the third element of `b`, `fav` is `o[f - 1]`. If `o.index(fav) > k - 1`, the state of the variables remains as described. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Additionally, `dic` is a dictionary with keys as elements from `o` and values as their respective counts in `o`.**
