The code snippet `counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv` decrements the value at the index `a[i - 1]` in the `counter` list by `adv`. 

Based on the initial state provided:
- `a` is unchanged.
- `counter` is unchanged except for the element at index `a[i - 1]` which is decremented by `adv`.
- `cnt` is `cnt - adv`.
- `ans` contains `[a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv]`.
- `i` is unchanged.
- `adv` is unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `counter` has its element at index `a[i - 1]` decremented by `adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` contains `[a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv]`, `i` is unchanged, `adv` is unchanged.**
