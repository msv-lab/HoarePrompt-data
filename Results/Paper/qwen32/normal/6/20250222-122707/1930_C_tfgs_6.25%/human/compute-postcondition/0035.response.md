The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `adv`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be the value it takes at the start of the next iteration, which is `j + 1` from the previous iteration.

State: **`a` is a list with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object with `counter[a[i - 1]] > 0`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n > len(a)`, `ans` is a list with the new element `a[i - 1] - j - 2` appended, `i` is a valid index such that `0 < i < len(a)`, `adv` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1**
