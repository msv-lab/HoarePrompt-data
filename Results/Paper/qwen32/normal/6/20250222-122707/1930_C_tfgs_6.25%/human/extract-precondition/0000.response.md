Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The function will be called multiple times (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) with different test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
