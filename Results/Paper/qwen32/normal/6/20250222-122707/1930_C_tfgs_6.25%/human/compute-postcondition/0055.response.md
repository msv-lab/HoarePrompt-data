The code snippet `ans.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `ans`. The values of `a`, `i`, `adv`, `counter`, `cnt`, and `ans` are affected by this operation. The conditions for reducing `counter` at key `a[i - 1]`, reducing `cnt`, and appending multiple elements to `ans` are not relevant to this specific code snippet, as it only appends `a[i]` to `ans`.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged; `i` and `adv` remain unchanged; `ans` has `a[i]` appended to it; `counter` and `cnt` remain unchanged.**
In natural language: The list `ans` now includes the element `a[i]` at its end. The lists `a` and the variables `i`, `adv`, `counter`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
