Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` remains unchanged; `counter` is a `Counter` object with all values decremented to 0; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in the same order, with additional elements inserted between them based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the remaining count `cnt`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` is a `Counter` object with all values decremented to 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in the same order, with additional elements inserted between them based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the remaining count `cnt`, and an additional element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` is a `Counter` object with all values decremented to 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in the same order, with additional elements inserted between them based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the remaining count `cnt`, and an additional element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1. The new last element of `ans` is the previous last element of `ans` minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains unchanged, `counter` is a `Counter` object with all values decremented to 0, `cnt` is 1 and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in the same order, with additional elements inserted between them based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the remaining count `cnt`, and an additional element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1. The new last element of `ans` is the previous last element of `ans` minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
