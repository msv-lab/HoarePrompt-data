Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-step Reasoning

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `nums`.

2. **Using a Deque**:
   - The list `nums` is converted into a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - A variable `ans` is initialized to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Processing Attacks**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships left (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last ship from the deque (`a = nums.popleft()`, `b = nums.pop()`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x = min(a, b)`).
   - If the number of remaining attacks `k` is at least twice the minimum durability (`k >= 2 * x`), it reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and subtracts `2 * x` from `k`.
   - If the durability of either ship becomes zero or less after the attack, it increments the `ans` counter and does not push that ship back into the deque.
   - If the durability of either ship is greater than zero, it pushes the ship back into the deque at the appropriate end.

4. **Handling Single Ship Case**:
   - If there is only one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`) and the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to its durability (`k >= nums[0]`), it increments the `ans` counter by one to account for the sinking of that ship.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the total number of ships that have sunk.

### Correctness Analysis

- The program correctly handles the alternating attack pattern on the first and last ships.
- It efficiently reduces the durability of the ships using the `deque` data structure, which allows for O(1) time complexity for popping from both ends.
- The program correctly accounts for the number of attacks left and the durability of the ships, ensuring that ships are only attacked if there are enough attacks left.
- The final check for a single remaining ship handles the edge case where there is only one ship left and the Kraken has enough attacks to sink it.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the given constraints and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
