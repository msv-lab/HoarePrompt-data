The code snippet `nums.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the end of the deque `nums`. This change affects the `nums` deque by increasing its length by one and appending `b` as the new last element.

Since `b` is greater than 0, the condition `a > 0` would have been true prior to this step, meaning `nums` already had `n-1` integers with the first element being `a` and the rest being the original `nums` elements. Therefore, after appending `b`, `nums` will have `n` elements.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where the first element is `a` and the last element is `b`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of `nums` respectively, and `x` is min(a, b).**
