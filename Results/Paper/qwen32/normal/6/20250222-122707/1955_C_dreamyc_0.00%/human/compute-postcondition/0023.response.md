The code snippet `a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()` removes the first and last elements from the deque `nums` and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. Given the initial state, `a` and `b` are initially the first and last elements of `nums`. After the operation, `a` and `b` will hold the values that were previously the first and last elements of `nums`, and `nums` will have these two elements removed.

Since `x` is defined as `min(a, b)` before the operation, its value will change based on the new values of `a` and `b` after the operation. However, the new values of `a` and `b` are not specified, so `x` will be the minimum of the newly assigned `a` and `b`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, and the remaining elements in `nums` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers (excluding the first and last elements that were `a` and `b`), `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the new first element of the deque, `b` is the new last element of the deque, and `x` is `min(a, b)`**.
