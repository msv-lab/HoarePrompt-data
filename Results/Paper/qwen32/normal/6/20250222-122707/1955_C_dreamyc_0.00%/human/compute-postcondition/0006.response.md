The code snippet `a -= x` subtracts the value of `x` from `a`. Given that `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, the value of `a` will be reduced by `x`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2 integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element that was in `nums` minus `x`, `b` is the last element that was in `nums`, `x` is min(a, b), and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`.**

In natural language: The value of `a` has been reduced by `x`, where `x` is the minimum of the original `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
