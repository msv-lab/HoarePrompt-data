The provided code only includes the operation `nums.appendleft(a)`. This operation adds the value of `a` to the left end of the deque `nums`. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `ans`, `b`, `x`) are modified by this operation. The condition involving `k` and `x` is not executed in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least `n-1` integers (with `a` added to the left), `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is the new first element of the deque, and `b` is the new last element of the deque.**
