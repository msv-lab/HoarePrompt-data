Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least `n-2` integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is the new first element of the deque before the operation minus `x`, `b` is the new last element of the deque before the operation, and `x` is `min(a, b)`**

In natural language: The value of `a` has been updated to be `a - x`, where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `ans`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
