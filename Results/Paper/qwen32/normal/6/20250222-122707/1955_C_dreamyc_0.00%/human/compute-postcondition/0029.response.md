Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the new first element of the deque, `b` is the new last element of the deque, and `x` is `min(a, b)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x` and `b` is updated to `b - x`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `k`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
