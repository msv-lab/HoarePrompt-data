### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program against the problem description, using the annotated code to validate the original assessment.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the list of durabilities `nums`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The `func_1` function handles the logic for each test case.
   - The list `nums` is converted to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to count the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Kraken Attacks Simulation:**
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop, the first and last elements from the deque (`a` and `b`) are popped, representing the first and last ships.
   - The variable `x` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b`, representing the maximum number of attacks that can be fully absorbed by both ships.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, the ships' durabilities are reduced by `x`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * x`.
   - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, the loop breaks as the Kraken cannot fully attack both ships.
   - After the attack, if a ship's durability is greater than 0, it is appended back to the deque; otherwise, the `ans` counter is incremented.

4. **Handling the Last Ship:**
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and `k` is still greater than or equal to its durability, that ship is also sunk, and `ans` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of ships that have sunk.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The annotations confirm that `n`, `k`, and `nums` are correctly read and initialized.
  
- **Inside Function:**
  - The annotations show that the `deque` operations and the logic for reducing the durability of ships are correctly implemented.
  - The conditions for breaking the loop and handling the last ship are correctly specified.

- **Final State:**
  - The annotations confirm that the final value of `ans` is correctly computed based on the number of ships that have sunk.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern by alternating between the first and last ships.
- It efficiently handles the decrement of durability and the removal of ships that have sunk.
- The use of a `deque` allows for efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial given the constraints.
- The logic for handling the last ship when there is only one ship left is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description and constraints.

**Final: True**
