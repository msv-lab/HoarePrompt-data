Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the new first element of the deque, `b` is the new last element of the deque, and `x` is `min(a, b)`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x` and `b` is updated to `b - x`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `k`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `ans` is now `ans + 1`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `x`) remain unchanged unless the conditions for updating `a` and `b` are met, in which case `a` and `b` are updated as specified.
