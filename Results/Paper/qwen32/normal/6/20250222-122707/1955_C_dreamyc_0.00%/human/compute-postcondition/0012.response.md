Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2 integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ans` is 0, `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of `nums` respectively, and `x` is min(a, b). Additionally, `a` is greater than 0. If `k` >= 2 * x, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `k` is less than 2 * x, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
