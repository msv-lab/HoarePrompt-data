### Reasoning:

The program follows the problem description accurately. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program operates:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of ships (`n`), the number of attacks (`k`), and the list of ship durabilities (`nums`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - The list of ship durabilities (`nums`) is converted into a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
    - The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of ships that have sunk.
    - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are at least two ships and there are remaining attacks (`k`).
    - In each iteration of the loop:
        - The first and last ships are attacked by the Kraken. Their durabilities are stored in `a` and `b`, respectively.
        - The Kraken attacks both ships up to the minimum of their current durabilities (`x`), reducing their durabilities by `x` and decrementing `k` by `2 * x`.
        - If the durability of the first ship (`a`) remains above 0 after the attack, it is added back to the front of the deque. Otherwise, the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.
        - Similarly, if the durability of the last ship (`b`) remains above 0 after the attack, it is added back to the end of the deque. Otherwise, the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.
    - If there is only one ship left in the deque and the remaining number of attacks (`k`) is sufficient to sink it, the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented by one.

3. **Output**: The program prints the number of ships that have sunk for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It efficiently handles the operations on the deque and correctly counts the number of ships that have sunk after the Kraken's attacks.

### Correctness: **True**
