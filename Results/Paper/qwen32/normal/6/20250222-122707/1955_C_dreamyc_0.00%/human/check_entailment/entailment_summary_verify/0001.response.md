Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and the list of durabilities `nums`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The `func_1` function handles the logic for each test case.
   - `nums` is converted to a `deque` to allow efficient popping from both ends.
   - `ans` is initialized to count the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Kraken Attacks Simulation:**
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - The first and last elements are popped from the deque (`a` and `b`).
     - `x` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b`, representing the maximum number of attacks that can be fully absorbed by both ships.
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, the ships' durabilities are reduced by `x`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * x`.
     - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, the loop breaks as the Kraken cannot fully attack both ships.
     - After the attack, if a ship's durability is greater than 0, it is appended back to the deque; otherwise, the `ans` counter is incremented.

4. **Handling the Last Ship:**
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and `k` is still greater than or equal to its durability, that ship is also sunk, and `ans` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of ships that have sunk.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Alternating Attacks:**
  - The program correctly alternates between the first and last ships by using `popleft()` and `pop()`.
  - It handles the reduction of durability and the removal of ships that have sunk correctly.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a `deque` ensures efficient operations for popping from both ends, which is crucial given the constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where there is only one ship left correctly.
  - It also handles cases where `k` is large enough to sink all ships.

- **Function Summary:**
  - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly states that the function reduces pairs of elements from `nums` by the minimum of the pair, using up to `k` units of reduction, and returns the count of elements that are completely reduced to 0. It also correctly describes the handling of the last ship.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description and constraints. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the original assessment is correct.

**Final: True**
