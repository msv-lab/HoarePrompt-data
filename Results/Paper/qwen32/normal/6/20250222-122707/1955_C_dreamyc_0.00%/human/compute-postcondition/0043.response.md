Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least `n-2` integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is the new first element of the deque, and `b` is the new last element of the deque. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * x`, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, the loop or statement is broken out without modifying `k`, `a`, or `b`. `x` is `min(a, b)` in both cases.**
