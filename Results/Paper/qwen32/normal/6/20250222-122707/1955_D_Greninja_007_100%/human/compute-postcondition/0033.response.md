Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `ans` remain unchanged; `r` is incremented by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]`, then `sm` is incremented by 1; `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition captures the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts of the program fragment.
