Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements common between `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. Additionally, `ca[a[r]]` is less than `cb[a[r]]`.**
