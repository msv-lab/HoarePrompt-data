Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 1 and `ca[a[r - m]]` decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r]]` is less than `cb[a[r]]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements common between `ca` and `cb` plus 1. Otherwise, `sm` remains the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements common between `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
