Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6. The function returns the total number of times the sum `sm` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.**
