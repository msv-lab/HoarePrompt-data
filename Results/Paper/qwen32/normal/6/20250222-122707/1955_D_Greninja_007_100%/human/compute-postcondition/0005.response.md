Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `ans` is 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements common between `ca` and `cb`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ans` being 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
