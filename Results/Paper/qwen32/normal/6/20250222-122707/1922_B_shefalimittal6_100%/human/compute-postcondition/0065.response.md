Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**

Natural Language: The variable `ans` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
