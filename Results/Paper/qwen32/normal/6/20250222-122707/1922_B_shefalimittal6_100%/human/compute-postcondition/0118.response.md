The provided Python code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding the value of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the calculation of `ans`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given.
- `v` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`.
- `idx` remains `idx + 3n + 2`.
- `cnt` remains `cnt + v[i]`.
- `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `ans` is updated by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`, `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is updated by `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**
