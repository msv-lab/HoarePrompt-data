Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is at least 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 2, `idx` is `idx + n + 4`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (now `cnt + 1`), `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the updated values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that `idx` has been incremented by 1, so `idx` is now `idx + n + 4` instead of `idx + n + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
