Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `x` is `int(data[idx])`.**

In natural language: The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
