The code provided splits the input string into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter. This means that `data` will be a list of strings, where each string is a part of the original input separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, `input` holds the entire input read from standard input, and `data` is not defined before the code is executed. After executing the code, `data` will be a list of strings derived from `input`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `input` holds the entire input read from standard input; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` by whitespace.**
