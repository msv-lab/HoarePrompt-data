The code snippet `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `int(data[idx-1])`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given**.
