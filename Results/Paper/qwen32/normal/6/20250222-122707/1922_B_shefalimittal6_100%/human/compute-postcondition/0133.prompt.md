You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `idx` is `idx + (total number of elements processed in all iterations)`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` for the last iteration, `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body for the last iteration, `results` now includes `str(ans)` for each of the `t` iterations.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: (an empty string)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is between 0 and `n`. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided integers, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
