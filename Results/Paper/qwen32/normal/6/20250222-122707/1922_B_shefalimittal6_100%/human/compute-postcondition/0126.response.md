The code snippet provided is:

```python
cnt += v[i]
```

This line of code increments the variable `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`
- `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2`
- `cnt` is `cnt + v[i] + v[i]`
- `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times
- `i` is `i + 1`
- If `v[i] >= 3`, `ans` is updated to `ans_original + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `ans_original`.

The only variable that changes is `cnt` because it is incremented by `v[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`, `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + 2*v[i]`, `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times, `i` is `i + 1`, If `v[i] >= 3`, `ans` is updated to `ans_original + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `ans_original`.**

In simple terms, `cnt` has been increased by `v[i]` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
