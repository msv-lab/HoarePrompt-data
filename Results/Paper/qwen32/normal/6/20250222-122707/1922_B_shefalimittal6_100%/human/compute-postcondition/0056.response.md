The code snippet `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` by converting the element at index `idx` of the `data` list to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` is at least 1
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 1
- `idx` is `idx + n + 2`
- `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (previously `cnt` but now `cnt + 1` if considering the effect of the operation)
- `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`
- `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end
- `x` is `int(data[idx + n + 1])`

After executing `x = int(data[idx])`, the value of `x` changes to `int(data[idx])`. All other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is at least 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 1, `idx` is `idx + n + 2`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (previously `cnt` but now `cnt + 1` if considering the effect of the operation), `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx])`**
