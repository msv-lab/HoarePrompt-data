The code snippet `v = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes the list `v` to be a list of `n + 1` zeros. This means that all the elements in `v` are reset to 0, and the length of `v` is set to `n + 1`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `idx`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only variable that is affected is `v`, which is now a list of `n + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**
