Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `day` is 'PM'; `n` must be greater than 0; `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively. Additionally, `h` is not equal to 0 and `h` is less than or equal to 12.** 

In simple terms, the value of `day` has been changed to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged.
