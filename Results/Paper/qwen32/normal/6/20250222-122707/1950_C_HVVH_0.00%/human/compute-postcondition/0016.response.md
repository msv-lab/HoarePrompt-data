Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. If `h` > 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is an integer representing the hours read from the input minus 12, such that 1 <= h <= 11. If `h` <= 12, `day` is 'AM' if `h` was originally 12, otherwise `day` remains 'PM'. `n` must be greater than 0. `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively. Additionally, `h` is not equal to 0 and if `h` was originally 12, `h` is set to 0.**
