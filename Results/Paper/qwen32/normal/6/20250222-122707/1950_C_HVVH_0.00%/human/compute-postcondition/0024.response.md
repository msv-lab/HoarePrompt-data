Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. `h` is an integer representing the hours read from the input minus 12, and `m` is an integer representing the minutes read from the input. `n` is greater than 0 and is now decremented by 1. `day` is 'PM'.**
