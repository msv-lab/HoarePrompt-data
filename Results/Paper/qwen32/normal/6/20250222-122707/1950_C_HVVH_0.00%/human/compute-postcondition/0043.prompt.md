Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `day` is 'AM'; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'PM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'AM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. If `h` was originally 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` was originally 12, `h` remains 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is between 1 and 11 inclusive, `day` remains 'AM'. `n` is greater than 0. `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. `h` is an integer representing the hours read from the input, adjusted to be between 1 and 12 if necessary, and `m` is an integer representing the minutes read from the input. `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`. `day` is 'AM' if the original `h` was 0 or 12, and 'PM' if the original `h` was greater than 12.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `h` is the hour read from the input minus 12 if the original `h` was greater than 12, otherwise `h` is 12 if the original `h` was 0, or remains the same otherwise; `m` is the minute read from the input, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n + 1`, `day` is 'AM' if the original `h` was 0 or 12, and 'PM' if the original `h` was greater than 12.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
