The code snippet `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the value of `h`. Given that `h` is greater than 12 and not equal to 0, after the operation, `h` will be a value between 1 and 11 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `day` is 'AM'; `n` must be greater than 0; `h` is an integer representing the hours read from the input minus 12, such that 1 <= h <= 11; `m` is an integer representing the minutes read from the input.**
