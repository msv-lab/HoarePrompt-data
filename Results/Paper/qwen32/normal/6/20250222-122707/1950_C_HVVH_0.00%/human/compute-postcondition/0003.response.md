The provided code snippet reads a time in the format "hh:mm" from the input and splits it into two integers, `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes). This does not affect the variables `t`, `s`, `day`, or `n`. The values of `h` and `m` will be determined by the input provided during execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `day` is 'AM'; `n` must be greater than 0; `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively.**
