### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python function to determine if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The variable `day` is initialized to 'AM', but this value will be updated based on the input hours.
   - The variable `n` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.

2. **Loop through test cases**:
   - For each test case, the input string `s` in the format `hh:mm` is split into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute) using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

3. **Conversion logic**:
   - **If `h` is 0**: 
     - This represents midnight in 24-hour format, which should be converted to `12:00 AM` in 12-hour format. The code correctly sets `h` to `12` and `day` to `'AM'`.
   - **If `h` is greater than 12**:
     - This represents the PM hours in 24-hour format. The code correctly subtracts `12` from `h` to convert it to the 12-hour format and sets `day` to `'PM'`.
   - **If `h` is between 1 and 11**:
     - This represents the AM hours in 24-hour format. The code correctly sets `day` to `'AM'`.
   - **If `h` is 12**:
     - This represents noon in 24-hour format, which should be converted to `12:00 PM` in 12-hour format. The code correctly sets `day` to `'PM'`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM`, ensuring that the hours and minutes are always two digits using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`.

5. **State after function call**:
   - After processing all test cases, the function does not have any leftover state that affects the correctness of the conversion.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all edge cases (midnight `00:00`, noon `12:00`, AM hours, and PM hours) and formats the output as specified.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
