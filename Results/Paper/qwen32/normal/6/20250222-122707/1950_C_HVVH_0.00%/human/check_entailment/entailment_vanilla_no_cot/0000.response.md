Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly convert 24-hour format times to 12-hour format times:

1. The `day` variable is not correctly assigned when `h` is 12. Specifically, if `h` is 12, it should be "PM", not "AM". This is handled correctly in the `elif h > 12` block but not in the `else` block.
2. The `day` variable is not correctly assigned when `h` is 0. It should be "AM", which is correctly handled, but the block should not override the `day` variable if `h` is already 12.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This version correctly handles all edge cases for the conversion.
