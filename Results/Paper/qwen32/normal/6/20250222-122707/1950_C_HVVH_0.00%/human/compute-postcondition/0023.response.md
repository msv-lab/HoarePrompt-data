Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. `h` is an integer representing the hours read from the input minus 12, and `m` is an integer representing the minutes read from the input. `n` is greater than 0 and is now decremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the hour `h` has been adjusted by subtracting 12 from it, while the values of `t`, `s`, `m`, and `n` remain as described in the initial state, with `n` having been decremented by 1.
