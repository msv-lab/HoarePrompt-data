The code reads a string input representing a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and splits it into two integers, `h` and `m`, representing hours and minutes respectively. The variable `n` is decremented by 1. The values of `t` and the remaining test cases are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively. `n` is greater than 0 and is now decremented by 1.**
