Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; day is 'AM'**.

The variable `day` has been assigned the value `'AM'`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
