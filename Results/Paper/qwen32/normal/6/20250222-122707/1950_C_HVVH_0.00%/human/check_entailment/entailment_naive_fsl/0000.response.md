Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly assigns the "AM" or "PM" designation for certain hours. Let's examine the problematic part of the code:

```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'PM'
    if h == 12:
        day = 'AM'
```

The issue arises when `h` is exactly 12. According to the 12-hour format, 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM, and 12:00 AM should correspond to 00:00 in 24-hour format. However, the current code incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 12, which would be correct only for 00:00 in 24-hour format.

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test case:**
```
1
12:00
```

**Expected output:**
```
12:00 PM
```

**Actual output from the program:**
```
12:00 AM
```

To fix this, the code should be modified to handle the case when `h` is 12 separately:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

With this correction, the program will handle all cases correctly.
