Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `h` is the hour read from the input, `m` is the minute read from the input, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n + 1`, `day` is 'AM'**.

The variable `day` has been changed to 'AM'. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
