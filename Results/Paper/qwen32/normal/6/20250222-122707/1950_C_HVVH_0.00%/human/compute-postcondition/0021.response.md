Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59. `h` is 12 and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes read from the input respectively. `n` is greater than 0 and is now decremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `h` has been set to 12. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `m`, and `n`) retain their previous values, except `n` which has been decremented by 1.
