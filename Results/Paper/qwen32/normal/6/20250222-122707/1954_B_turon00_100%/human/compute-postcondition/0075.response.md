The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged except for `cnt`. Given the initial state, `cnt` was either 1 or 0. After the increment, `cnt` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or `cnt` will be 1 if it was initially 0.

Output State: **`ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`; otherwise, `ans` is 0, `t` remains 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, and `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `i` is incremented by 1.**
