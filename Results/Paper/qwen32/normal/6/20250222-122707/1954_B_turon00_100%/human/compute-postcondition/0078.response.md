Postcondition: **`ans` is `n` if `a[i]` equals `tmp` and `cnt` is either 1 or 2; otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `ans` was `n` before, or `ans` is 0. `t` remains 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, or 1 or 2 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
