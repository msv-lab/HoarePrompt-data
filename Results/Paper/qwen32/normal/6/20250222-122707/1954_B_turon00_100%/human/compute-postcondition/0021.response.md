Given the code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)`, we need to understand the impact on the variables. The code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. 

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` and `cnt`, we can only describe the state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `i` is 2; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the smaller of its previous value and the value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
