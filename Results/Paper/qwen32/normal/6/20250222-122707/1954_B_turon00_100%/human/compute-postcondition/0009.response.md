Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is `n`. The current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
