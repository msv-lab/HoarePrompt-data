Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is the integer value provided by the input, and it satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is the length of the list `a`.
3. `a` is the list of integers provided by the third input line.
4. `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the list `a` (`a[0]`).
5. `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` if the loop ends with such a sequence, otherwise 0.
6. `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
7. `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

Let's break down the variables and their relationships:
- `tmp` is the starting element of the list `a`.
- `cnt` is used to count the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.

Given that `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, we need to determine the value of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- Since `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and it is not equal to `n`, it means that `ans` must be less than `n`.
- The value of `cnt` depends on the sequence of elements in the list `a`. However, without the specific list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt`.
- `ans` is initialized to a value that is less than `n` and is updated throughout the loop to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the information provided, the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without the specific list `a`. However, we can describe `ans` as the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and it is guaranteed to be less than `n`.

### Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and it is guaranteed to be less than `n`)**
