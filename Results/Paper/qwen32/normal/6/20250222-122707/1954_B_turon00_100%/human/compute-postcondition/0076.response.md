The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` will update the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `cnt`. 

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`; otherwise, `ans` is 0.
- `t` remains 2.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `tmp` is `a[0]`.
- `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`; otherwise, `cnt` is 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The new value of `ans` will be:
- If `ans` was `n` and `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes 0.
- If `ans` was `n` and `cnt` is 1, `ans` remains `n`.
- If `ans` was 0, `ans` remains 0 regardless of the value of `cnt`.

Therefore, the new state is:
Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `ans` was `n`; otherwise, `ans` is 0; `t` remains 2; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`; otherwise, `cnt` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
