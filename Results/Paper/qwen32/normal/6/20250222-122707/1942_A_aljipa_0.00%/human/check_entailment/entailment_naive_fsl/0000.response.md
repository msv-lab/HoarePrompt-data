Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem description. Specifically, it does not generate valid arrays for all possible values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case `k == n`**: The program correctly outputs an array of `n` ones. This is because all cyclic shifts of an array filled with the same element are sorted.
2. **Case `k == 1`**: The program correctly outputs an array with elements ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This is because only one cyclic shift (the one starting with the smallest element) will be sorted.
3. **Case `1 < k < n`**: The program incorrectly outputs `-1` for all such cases. However, there can be valid arrays that satisfy the condition where `1 < k < n`.

For example, consider the case `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program outputs `-1`, but a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`. Here's why:

- Cyclic shift 1: `[1, 2, 1]` (sorted)
- Cyclic shift 2: `[2, 1, 1]` (sorted)
- Cyclic shift 3: `[1, 1, 2]` (sorted)

In this example, there are 3 sorted cyclic shifts, which satisfies the condition `k = 2`.

Another example is `n = 4` and `k = 2`. The program outputs `-1`, but a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`:

- Cyclic shift 1: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` (not sorted)
- Cyclic shift 2: `[2, 3, 1, 1]` (not sorted)
- Cyclic shift 3: `[3, 1, 1, 2]` (sorted)
- Cyclic shift 4: `[1, 1, 2, 3]` (sorted)

In this example, there are 2 sorted cyclic shifts, which satisfies the condition `k = 2`.

Since the program incorrectly handles cases where `1 < k < n`, it is not fully correct. Therefore, the correctness is False.
