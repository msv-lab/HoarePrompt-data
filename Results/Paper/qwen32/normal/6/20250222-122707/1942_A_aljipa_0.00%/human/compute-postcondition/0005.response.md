The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop itself. However, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is decremented implicitly with each iteration in the loop head, we need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given:
- `t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `res` is a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `res` is a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.**
