Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `res` is a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.**

In simpler terms, after the code executes:
- `t` remains the same integer read from input, between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` and `k` remain the integers read from input.
- `res` is determined based on the value of `k`:
  - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k` equals 1, `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
  - If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, `res` is a list containing a single element, -1.
