The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` which was initially read from the input remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input**.
