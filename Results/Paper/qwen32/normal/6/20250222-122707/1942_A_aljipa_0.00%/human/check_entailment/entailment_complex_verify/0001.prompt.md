You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each iteration, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The variable `res` will be a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met. The output for each iteration will be the contents of `res` printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if its elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift of an array involves moving some elements from the beginning of the array to the end.
3. **Objective**: For given `n` and `k`, find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1000`
   - `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `1000`.

### Solution Analysis:
Let's break down the solution provided:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)
```

#### Cases Handled:
1. **k = n**: 
   - **Description**: All cyclic shifts need to be sorted.
   - **Implementation**: The solution provides an array of `n` ones (`[1] * n`).
   - **Reasoning**: Any array with identical elements (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`) will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.
   - **Correctness**: True.

2. **k = 1**:
   - **Description**: Exactly one cyclic shift needs to be sorted.
   - **Implementation**: The solution provides an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
   - **Reasoning**: The array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is already sorted, and its cyclic shifts will not be sorted unless the shift is the original array.
   - **Correctness**: True.

3. **1 < k < n**:
   - **Description**: Between one and all cyclic shifts need to be sorted.
   - **Implementation**: The solution provides `[-1]`, indicating no valid array exists.
   - **Reasoning**: For `1 < k < n`, creating an array where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted is more complex and cannot be achieved with the simple patterns used for `k = 1` and `k = n`.
   - **Correctness**: False. The solution incorrectly returns `[-1]` for these cases. There are valid arrays for some values of `k` in this range.

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly handles the cases where `k = n` and `k = 1` but incorrectly handles the cases where `1 < k < n`. Therefore, the overall correctness of the solution is False.

**Correctness: False**
