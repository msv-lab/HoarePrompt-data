Let's analyze the given program step-by-step in the context of the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to construct an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The possible outputs are:
1. An array of `n` integers if such an array exists.
2. `-1` if no such array exists.

### Program Analysis
The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)
```

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Condition Handling**:
    - If `k == n`, it sets `res` to `[1] * n`. This is a valid solution because if all elements are the same, all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
    - If `k == 1`, it sets `res` to `range(n)`, which translates to `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This is a valid solution because only the first cyclic shift will be sorted.
    - If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., `k` is neither `n` nor `1`), it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating that no valid array exists.

### Evaluation of Conditions
- **Case `k == n`**: This is correct. If `k == n`, then all elements of the array must be the same to ensure that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
- **Case `k == 1`**: This is correct. If `k == 1`, then the array should be strictly increasing (or any other pattern that ensures only one cyclic shift is sorted). The simplest example is a strictly increasing sequence like `range(n)`.
- **Case `1 < k < n`**: This is incorrect. The program incorrectly outputs `-1` for this case, but there can be valid arrays that satisfy the condition. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 1]` has two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where `1 < k < n`. It incorrectly outputs `-1` for these cases, whereas there can be valid arrays that meet the requirements.

**Correctness: False**
