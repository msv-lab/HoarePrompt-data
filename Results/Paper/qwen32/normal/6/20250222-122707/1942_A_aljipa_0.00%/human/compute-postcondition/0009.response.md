The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop runs `t` times, and since `_` is not used, we only need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already executed once, we need to decrement `t` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration. The variables `n`, `k`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `res` is a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.**
