Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each iteration, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The variable `res` will be a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met. The output for each iteration will be the contents of `res` printed to the console.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run `t` times. For each run, it will read `n` and `k` from the input. Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, it will create a list `res` and print its contents. If `k` equals `n`, `res` will be a list of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, `res` will be a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If neither condition is met, `res` will be a list containing just -1.
