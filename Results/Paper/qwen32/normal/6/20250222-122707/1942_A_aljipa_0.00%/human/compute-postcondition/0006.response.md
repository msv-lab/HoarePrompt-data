The code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` by reading a line of input, splitting it into two parts, converting each part to an integer, and assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `res` is given, but only `n` and `k` are changed by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `res` is a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.**
