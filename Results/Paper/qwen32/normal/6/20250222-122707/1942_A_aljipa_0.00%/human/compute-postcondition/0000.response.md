Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer read from the input, which is within the range of 1 to 1000 inclusive. The conditions for `n` and `k` for each test case, as well as the constraint on the sum of `n` over all test cases, remain unchanged.
