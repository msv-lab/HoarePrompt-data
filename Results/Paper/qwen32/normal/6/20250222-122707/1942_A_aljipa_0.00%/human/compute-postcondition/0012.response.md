To determine the output of the `print(*res)` statement, we need to consider the different possible states of the `res` list based on the values of `k` and `n`.

1. **If `k` equals `n`:**
   - The `res` list is initialized as a list of 1s with length `n`.
   - This means `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]` with `n` elements.
   - The `print(*res)` statement will print each element of the list `res` separated by spaces.

2. **If `k` equals 1:**
   - The `res` list is initialized as a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
   - This means `res` will be equivalent to `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
   - The `print(*res)` statement will print each element of the list `res` separated by spaces.

3. **If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor equal to 1:**
   - The `res` list is initialized as a list containing the single element `-1`.
   - This means `res` will be `[-1]`.
   - The `print(*res)` statement will print the single element `-1`.

Given these conditions, the output of the `print(*res)` statement depends on the values of `k` and `n`. Here's the final description of the output:

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (n times) if k equals n, or 0 1 2 ... n-1 if k equals 1, or -1 if k is neither equal to n nor equal to 1**
