The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `xor`. The other variables `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0.**
