### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior to see if they meet the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to take an array `arr` and a number `x`, and return the maximum number `k` as per the problem statement.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` simply calls `find_max(arr, 31)` and returns its result. It does not use the value of `x` at all, which is a critical part of the problem statement.

2. **Function `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - This function seems to recursively try to partition the array `cur_arr` based on the XOR values and the specified bit.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of the final XOR value of `cur_arr` is not set, it tries to form a new array `new_arr` with segments where the XOR of the segment does not have the `bit`-th bit set.
   - It then recursively calls itself with the new array and the next lower bit.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of the final XOR value is set, it returns the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is set, it returns the maximum value between the length of `cur_arr` and the length of `new_arr`.

### Issues:
- The function `func_1` does not use the value of `x` as required by the problem statement.
- The function `find_max` does not properly incorporate the value of `x` into its decision-making process.
- The base case of the recursion in `find_max` (when `bit == -1`) returns the length of `cur_arr`, which is not necessarily correct because it does not consider the value of `x`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` should incorporate `x` into its logic, and `find_max` should properly use `x` to determine the maximum number of segments.

**Correctness: False**
