The code snippet assigns the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` to the variable `thing1`. This means `thing1` will now hold the value returned by this function call. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, and the condition that the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains values of `xor` where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` is the final XOR value of elements in `cur_arr` that did not reset `xor` to 0, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0**.
