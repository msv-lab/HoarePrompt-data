Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `xor` is set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
