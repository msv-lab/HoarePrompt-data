The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has more than one element, the loop will execute again for the next element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second element of `cur_arr`.

To execute the loop one more time:
- `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `cur_arr`.
- `cur_arr` must still have elements remaining after the current one.

Given that `i` is the second element of `cur_arr` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be the third element of `cur_arr` (if it exists).

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, `thing1` is 0. If `xor` >> `bit` & 1` is 0, then `xor` is set to 0 and `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it. Otherwise, `xor` remains `i`.**
