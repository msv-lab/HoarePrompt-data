The code snippet provided performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the value of `i`. This operation updates the value of `xor` but does not affect the other variables directly unless the conditions following this operation are met. Given the initial state, `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged unless specified.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`, `thing1` is 0, `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`. If `xor` >> `bit` & 1` is 0, then `xor` is set to 0 and `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it. Otherwise, `xor` remains `i`.**
