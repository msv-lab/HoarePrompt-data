The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over `cur_arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `cur_arr`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1.
- `xor` is 0.
- `thing1` is 0.
- If the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` contains the value of the original `xor`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.

Since `i` is the loop variable and it iterates over `cur_arr`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `cur_arr`. Assuming that the previous iteration used the first element of `cur_arr`, the next iteration will use the second element.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`.**
