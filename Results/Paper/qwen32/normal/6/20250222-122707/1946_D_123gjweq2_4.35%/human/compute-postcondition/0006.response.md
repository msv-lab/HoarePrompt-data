The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over `cur_arr`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `cur_arr` itself. For the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
