The provided initial state includes `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `bit`, which is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. However, the current value of `bit` is -1. The Python code snippet simply returns the length of `cur_arr`. Since the length of a list is a count of the number of elements in it, and we do not have specific information about the elements in `cur_arr`, we can only state that the return value will be the number of elements in `cur_arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the length of `cur_arr`, which is the number of elements in the list `cur_arr`.**
