The code snippet provided appends the value of the variable `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Given the initial state, other variables remain unchanged except for `new_arr`, which gains a new element.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `xor` is `i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it.**
