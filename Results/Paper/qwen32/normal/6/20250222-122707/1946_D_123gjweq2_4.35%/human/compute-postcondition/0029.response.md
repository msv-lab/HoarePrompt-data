Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.**

To break it down:
- `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` will return some value based on the implementation of `find_max`, which we don't have, but we know it takes `cur_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments.
- `len(new_arr)` is the number of elements in `new_arr`, which contains values of `xor` where the `bit`-th bit was 0.

The returned value will be whichever of these two is greater.
