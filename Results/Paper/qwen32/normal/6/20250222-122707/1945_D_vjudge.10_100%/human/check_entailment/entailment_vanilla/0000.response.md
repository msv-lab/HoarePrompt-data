Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue by possibly bribing people in front of him. For each person `i` in the queue:
- Kirill can bribe person `i` to swap places, paying `a[i]` coins.
- If Kirill bribes person `i` to swap places, he also has to pay `b[k]` coins to each person `k` between `i` and his new position.

The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Program Analysis

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that is supposed to compute the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:

1. **Initialization**: `pergunta` is initialized to infinity. This variable will store the minimum number of coins needed to reach one of the first `m` positions.
2. **Loop through the queue in reverse**: The loop iterates from the last person in the queue to the first.
3. **Check if the current position is within the first `m` positions**:
   - If `i < m`, it means that if Kirill bribes person `i` to swap places, he will end up in one of the first `m` positions. The cost of this swap is `x + a[i]`, where `x` is the accumulated cost of bribes so far.
   - The program updates `pergunta` with the minimum value between the current `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`.
4. **Accumulate the cost**: The variable `x` is updated by adding the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is the cost of either bribing person `i` directly or paying the cost of person `i` being in the way if Kirill bribes someone else.

### Issues in the Program

The main issue with the program is in the logic of accumulating the cost `x`. The program adds `min(a[i], b[i])` to `x` in each iteration, which is incorrect. The cost `x` should only include the costs of bribes that Kirill actually makes, not the costs of people being in the way.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve a priority queue (min-heap) to always consider the cheapest possible bribe. Here's a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. Use a priority queue to keep track of the smallest `a[i]` values encountered so far.
2. Iterate through the queue from the first person to the last.
3. For each person `i`:
   - If `i < m`, calculate the cost of bribing person `i` and update the minimum cost.
   - Add `a[i]` to the priority queue.
   - If the size of the priority queue exceeds `m`, remove the largest `a[i]` value from the queue (since we only need to consider the smallest `m` bribes).
4. The minimum cost is the answer.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
