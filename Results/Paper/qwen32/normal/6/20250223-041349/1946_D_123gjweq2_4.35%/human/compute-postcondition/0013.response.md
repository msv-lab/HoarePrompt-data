The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the value of `i`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state.

- If the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` (which is either 0 or 5) is 0, then `new_arr` is [5] and `xor` is initially 0.
- If the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 1, then `new_arr` is [] and `xor` is initially 5.
- `thing1` remains 0.
- `cur_arr` and `bit` remain unchanged.
- `i` is the next element in `cur_arr` and remains unchanged.

After the operation `xor ^= i`, the value of `xor` changes based on the value of `i` and the original value of `xor`.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is [5] if the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list, `xor` is the result of `xor ^ i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `xor` is updated to the result of `xor ^ i`, while all other variables retain their initial values except for `xor`.
