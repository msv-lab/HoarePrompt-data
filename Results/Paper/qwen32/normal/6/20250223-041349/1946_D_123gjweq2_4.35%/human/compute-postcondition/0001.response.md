Given the initial state, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, and `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. However, the current value of `bit` is -1, which is outside the specified range. Despite this, the value of `bit` does not affect the execution of the provided code snippet, which only returns the length of `cur_arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the length of cur_arr, which is a list of non-negative integers.**
