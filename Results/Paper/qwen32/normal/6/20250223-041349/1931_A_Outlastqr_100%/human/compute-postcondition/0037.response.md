Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is a new integer read from input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` > 27, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' + the `n-3`th letter of the alphabet.**
