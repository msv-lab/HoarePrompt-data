The code snippet appends a substring from the `alphabet` string to the `word` string. Specifically, it takes the character at the index `n - 53` from `alphabet` and appends it to `word`, followed by the string `'zz'`. 

Let's break it down:
- `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 78.
- The index `n - 53` will be between `3 - 53 = -50` and `78 - 53 = 25`.
- Since Python's string indexing allows negative indices to wrap around, `n - 53` will effectively be between 0 and 25 when considering the `alphabet` string.
- Therefore, `alphabet[n - 53]` will be a character from 'a' to 'z'.
- The `word` string, which was initially empty, will now contain the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged. The variable `i` was incremented by 1 in the initial state, but the provided code snippet does not affect `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is a string containing `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
