Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` > 52, `word` is a string containing `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If 28 <= `n` <= 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If 3 <= `n` <= 26, `word` is 'aa' concatenated with the `n-3`-th character of the alphabet.**
