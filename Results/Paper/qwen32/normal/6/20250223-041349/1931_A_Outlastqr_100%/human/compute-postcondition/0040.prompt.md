Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 27:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    elif n == 27:
        word = 'aay'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'; `word` is a string that has been updated based on the value of `n`. If `n` > 52, `word` is updated to include the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`. If `n` equals 27, `word` is the string `'aay'`. If `n` is between 28 and 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is between 3 and 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` > 52, `word` is a string containing `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If 28 <= `n` <= 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If 3 <= `n` <= 26, `word` is 'aa' concatenated with the `n-3`-th character of the alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is a new integer read from input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, if `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' + the `n-3`th letter of the alphabet. If `n` is less than 3, `word` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
