Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is equal to `t` (indicating the loop has finished all iterations). For each iteration, `word` is a string updated based on the value of `n` as described: if `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If 28 <= `n` <= 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is 27, `word` is `'aay'`. If 3 <= `n` <= 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t`, meaning the loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the variable `word` will be constructed based on the value of `n` according to the given rules, and the `alphabet` string remains unchanged throughout the process.
