Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer read from the input, which is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 1. However, based on the initial state, `n` is specifically constrained to be between 3 and 78 inclusive for each of the `t` test cases. The other variables, `t` and `alphabet`, remain unchanged.
