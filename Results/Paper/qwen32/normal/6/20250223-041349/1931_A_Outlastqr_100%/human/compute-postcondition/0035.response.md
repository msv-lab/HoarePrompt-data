Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is a new integer read from input, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]**.

In this output state, the variable `word` is updated to be the string 'aa' concatenated with the character at the index `n - 3` in the string `alphabet`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the increment in `i`.
