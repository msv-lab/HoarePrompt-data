Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'; `word` is a string that has been updated based on the value of `n`. If `n` > 52, `word` is updated to include the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`. If `n` equals 27, `word` is the string `'aay'`. If `n` is between 28 and 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is between 3 and 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer.**

In this output state, `n` has been updated to the value read from the input, and all other variables remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions and conditions.
