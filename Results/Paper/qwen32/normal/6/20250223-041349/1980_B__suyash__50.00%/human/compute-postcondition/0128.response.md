Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: An input string.
2. **`b`**: A list of integers derived from `a`. The exact derivation process is not specified, but it is a list of integers.
3. **`k`**: The third element of the list `b` (`b[2]`).
4. **`i`**: A variable that is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, so this operation doesn't affect the output directly.
5. **`o`**: A list of strings derived from a new input. This list is not used in the provided print statement.
6. **`n`**: The first element of the list `b` (`b[0]`).
7. **`f`**: The second element of the list `b` (`b[1]`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `k`, `i`, `o`, `n`, and `f`.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **YES**
