Postcondition: **`t` is the integer provided by the input, where 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `a` is the new string provided by the input and contains at least one word; `o` is a list of strings derived from splitting the new input string `a` by whitespace and sorted in reverse order; `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `o`; `dic` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements from `o` and values are their counts in `o`; `l` is a list of unique elements from `o`, sorted in reverse order and must have at least one element; `i` is 2; `b` is a list of integers derived from the string `a`. If `fav` does not equal `l[i]`, `k` is the third element of the list `b` minus the count of `l[i]` in `o`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, then the conditions remain as described above. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 0. If `fav` equals `l[i]`, `k` is updated to `k - dic[l[i]]`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `k` is less than 0 or not.**
