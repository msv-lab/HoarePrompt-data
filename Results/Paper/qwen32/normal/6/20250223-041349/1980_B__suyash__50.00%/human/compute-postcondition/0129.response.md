The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `k`, `i`, `o`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers derived from `a`; `k` is `b[2]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `o` is a list of strings derived from the new input; `n` is the first element of `b`; `f` is the second element of `b`.**
