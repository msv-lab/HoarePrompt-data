Postcondition: **`t` is the integer provided by the input, where 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first element of the list `b`; `f` is the second element of the list `b`; `k` is the third element of the list `b`; `a` is the new string provided by the input; `o` is a list of strings derived from splitting the new input string by whitespace and sorted in reverse order; `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` of the sorted list `o`; `dic` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements from `o` and values are their counts in `o`; `l` is a list of unique elements from `o`, sorted in reverse order; `i` is `i + 1` and `b` is a list of integers derived from the string `a`. If the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, the program does not change any of the variables.**
