Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `l` is a list with at least one unique element.
2. `i` is set to 1.
3. `k` is decreased by `dic[l[1]]`.

### Analysis:
- The list `l` has at least one unique element, but the exact elements are not specified.
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- The variable `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]`. Here, `dic` is presumably a dictionary, and `l[1]` refers to the second element of the list `l`. However, the exact value of `k` before this operation and the contents of the dictionary `dic` are not provided.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `l`, `i`, or `k`. The string `'MAYBE'` is explicitly provided to be printed.

### Output:
Output: **MAYBE**
