Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `l` is a list with at least one unique element.
2. `i` is set to 1.
3. `k` is decreased by `dic[l[1]]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('YES')`.
- The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
- The variables `l`, `i`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is printing a literal string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `l`, `i`, or `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
