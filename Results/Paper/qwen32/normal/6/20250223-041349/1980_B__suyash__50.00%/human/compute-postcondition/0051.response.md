The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. The initial state describes various variables and objects (`t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `o`, `fav`, `dic`, `l`, `i`, `k`), but none of these variables directly influence the `print('NO')` statement.
2. The `print('NO')` statement is hardcoded to print the string 'NO', regardless of the values of any variables or objects in the program.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
