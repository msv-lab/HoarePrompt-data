Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find a permutation of integers from 1 to n such that no two distinct indices i and j exist where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. The given program simply reverses the order of the even-indexed elements in the permutation, which does not guarantee that the resulting permutation meets the required condition.

For example, consider the input `4`. The output of the program would be `1 4 3 2`. Here, `p_1=1` divides `p_3=3` and `p_2=4` divides `p_4=2`, which violates the condition.

A correct approach would be to construct the permutation in such a way that the divisibility condition is not met. One possible solution is to interleave the largest and smallest elements, or use a different strategy to ensure the condition is satisfied.
