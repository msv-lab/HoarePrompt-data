Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `a` is odd, no specific changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a > b` is true if `a` is greater than `b`, and false otherwise.***

This postcondition summarizes the states of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` after the if-else block, considering all possible cases for `a` and `b`.
