Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
  - `i` is initialized to 0.
  - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
  - It is specified that `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is not equal to 1.
  - The current value of `b` is explicitly stated to be 1.

- **Print Statement:**
  ```python
  print('Bob')
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The print statement `print('Bob')` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, or `b`.
  - The string 'Bob' is a literal string and will be printed exactly as it is, without any modification or substitution.

- **Output:**
  - The print statement will output the string 'Bob'.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **Bob**
