Given the initial state, the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` have specific roles, but they are not directly used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'` to the console. The values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` do not influence what is printed by this statement.

Thus, the output is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
