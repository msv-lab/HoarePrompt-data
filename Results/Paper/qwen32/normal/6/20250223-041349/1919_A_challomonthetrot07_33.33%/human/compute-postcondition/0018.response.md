Postcondition: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; i is 0; a and b are integers read from the input, a is not equal to b, a is not equal to 1, and b is not equal to 1; a is an even integer; and either a is not even or b is not odd. The current value of a is greater than the current value of b.**
