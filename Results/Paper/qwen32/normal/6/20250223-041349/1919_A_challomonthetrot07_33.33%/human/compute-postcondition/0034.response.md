The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state describes several variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`) but these are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Alice')`.
2. The string `'Alice'` is a literal and does not depend on any variables.
3. The variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output will be the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
