Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

Initial State:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `i` is set to the integer value 2.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.

The print statement:
```python
print('Bob')
```

The print statement directly outputs the string `'Bob'`. The values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` do not influence what is printed by this statement. The print statement is static and outputs the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of the variables.

Output: **Bob**
