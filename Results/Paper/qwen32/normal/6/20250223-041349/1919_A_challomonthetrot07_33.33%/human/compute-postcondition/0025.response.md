Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `b` is 1, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is an odd integer, it remains odd. If `a` is an even integer, it remains even. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, `a` remains even and `b` remains odd. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is not greater than `b`.**
