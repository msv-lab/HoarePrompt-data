The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `T`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input and their specific values do not affect the loop control variables directly.

The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `T`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `T` remains unchanged.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 2; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
