### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` together satisfy the problem requirements for finding a Hamiltonian path in the described graph.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` takes a degree `d` as input and sends a query to the interactor to find a vertex `v` with a degree of at least `d`. It also asks for another vertex `u` that is not connected to `v`.
- The function reads the response from the interactor, which consists of two integers `v` and `u`.
- The function returns these two integers.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` is the main function that constructs the Hamiltonian path.
- It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
- It enters a loop that continues until all vertices have been added to the path (`remaining_vertices` is empty).
- Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0`.
- For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get a vertex `v` and a vertex `u` not connected to `v`.
- If `v` is `0`, it means no vertex with degree at least `d` was found, so it continues to the next degree.
- If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path, removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`, and breaks out of the degree loop to move to the next iteration of the main loop.
- Once all vertices are added to the path, it prints the path in the required format.

#### Correctness Check:
- The algorithm correctly uses the query mechanism to find vertices with decreasing degrees and ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once.
- The function `func_2` ensures that the path is constructed in a way that respects the constraints of the problem, i.e., it finds a Hamiltonian path by iteratively selecting vertices based on their degrees and ensuring that the selected vertex is not yet included in the path.
- The algorithm guarantees that no more than `n` queries are made, as each query removes one vertex from the graph, and there are `n` vertices in total.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the solution to the problem. They ensure that a Hamiltonian path is found in at most `n` queries, as required.

**Correctness: True**
