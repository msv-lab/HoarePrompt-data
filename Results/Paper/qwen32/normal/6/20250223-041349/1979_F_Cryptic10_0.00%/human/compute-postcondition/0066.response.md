The code `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the vertex `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Given that `remaining_vertices` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v` and `u`, after the removal, `remaining_vertices` will no longer include `v`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v`, `u`, and the newly removed `v`. If `v` is 0, then `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `v` and `u`.**
