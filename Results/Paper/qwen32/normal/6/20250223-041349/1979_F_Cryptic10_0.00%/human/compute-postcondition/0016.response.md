Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is [0] if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n`; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(1)`; `u` is the second return value of `func_1(1)`; `d` is 1. If `v` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
