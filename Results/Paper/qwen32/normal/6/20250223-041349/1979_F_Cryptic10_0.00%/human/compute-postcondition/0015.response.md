The code snippet provided is simply `continue`, which means the program will skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Given that there are no assignments or changes to any variables in the provided code, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is [0] if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n`; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(1)`; `u` is the second return value of `func_1(1)`; `d` is 1.**
