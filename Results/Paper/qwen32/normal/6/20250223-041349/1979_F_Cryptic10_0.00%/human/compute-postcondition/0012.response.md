Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `path` is [0] if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n`. `v` is 0 and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `v` remains 0. `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and remains unchanged. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
