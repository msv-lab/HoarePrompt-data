Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` three times (with the additional `v` added at the end), and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` once or twice, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described. `d` is `d - 1`. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the state remains exactly as described in the initial state.
