The function `query(d)` is used to interact with an external system that provides information about a graph. `d` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum degree of a vertex to query. The function returns a tuple of two integers: the first integer is the vertex `v` with the minimum degree that is at least `d`, and the second integer is another vertex `u` that is not connected to `v`. If no such vertex `v` exists, both integers are 0. The interaction involves making no more than `n` queries for each test case, where `n` is the number of vertices in the graph, and `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
