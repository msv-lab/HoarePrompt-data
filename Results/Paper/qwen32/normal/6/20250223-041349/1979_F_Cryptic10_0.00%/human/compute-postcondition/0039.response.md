Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u`, where `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and is not changed; `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`; `v` is not 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged. The only impact is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
