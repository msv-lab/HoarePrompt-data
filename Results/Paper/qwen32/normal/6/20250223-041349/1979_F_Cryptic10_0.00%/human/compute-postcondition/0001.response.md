The code snippet creates a set named `remaining_vertices` that contains all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `path` remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`.**
