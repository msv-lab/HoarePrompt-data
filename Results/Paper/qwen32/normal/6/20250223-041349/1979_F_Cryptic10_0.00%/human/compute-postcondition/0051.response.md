Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 2`.**

The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the loop body and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
