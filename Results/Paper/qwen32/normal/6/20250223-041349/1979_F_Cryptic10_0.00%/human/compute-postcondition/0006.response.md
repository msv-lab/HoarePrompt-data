The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables directly. The values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`; `v` is 0; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`**
