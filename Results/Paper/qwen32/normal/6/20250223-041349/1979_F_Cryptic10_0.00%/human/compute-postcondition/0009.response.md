The code snippet `path.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the `path` list. Since `v` is 0, `path` will now contain the single element `[0]`. The variable `n` remains a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `remaining_vertices` still contains integers from 1 to `n`, and `u` remains the value returned by `func_1(d)`. The variable `v` is not removed from `remaining_vertices` by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is [0]; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`; `v` is 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`**.
