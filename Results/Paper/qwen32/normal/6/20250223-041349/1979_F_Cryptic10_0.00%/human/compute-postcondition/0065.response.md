The code snippet `path.append(v)` adds the vertex `v` to the list `path`. Given the initial state, `path` initially contains a single vertex `v` from `remaining_vertices`. After executing the code, `path` will now contain two occurrences of `v`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v` and `u`, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. If `v` is 0, then `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `v` and `u`.**
