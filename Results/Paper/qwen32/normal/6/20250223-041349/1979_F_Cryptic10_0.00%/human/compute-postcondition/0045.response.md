The code snippet `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. The value of `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`. Since `v` was already in `remaining_vertices` during the loop and has been added to `path`, the list `path` will now include this vertex `v`.

The other variables (`n`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`, and `d`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`.**
