Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is [0]; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0; `v` is 0 and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `remaining_vertices` has been updated to exclude the value `0`, which was initially in the set. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
