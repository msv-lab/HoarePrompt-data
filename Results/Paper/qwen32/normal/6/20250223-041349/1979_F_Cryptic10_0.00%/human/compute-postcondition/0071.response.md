The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and proceeds with the next iteration. In this context, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, `u`, and `d` are not modified by the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement only affects the control flow of the loop.

Thus, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` contains the single vertex `v`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v`, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is also except `u`. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. `d` is `d - 1`.**
