Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices` and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. `v` is in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0, then `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `v` and `u`.**
