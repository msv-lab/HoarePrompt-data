The provided code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `path`, or `remaining_vertices`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing all vertices from 1 to n in the order they were found and added to `path`; `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**
