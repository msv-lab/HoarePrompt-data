Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` contains the single vertex `v`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v`, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is also except `u`. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. `d` is `d - 1`.**

Natural Language: After executing the code, `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The variable `d` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`) remain unchanged as per their initial descriptions.
