The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables directly. Therefore, the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` - 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1.**
