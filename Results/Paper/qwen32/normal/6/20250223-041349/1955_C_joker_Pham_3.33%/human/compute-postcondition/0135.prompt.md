You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Additionally, the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                break
            break
        
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l] * 2:
                k -= a[l] * 2
                a[r] -= a[l]
                if a[r] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
                continue
            elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if a[r] < a[l]:
            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
                continue
            elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        
    #State: `k` is reduced to a value less than the minimum required to perform another operation, `a` is modified based on the operations performed, `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the operations performed, and `sunks` reflects the number of successful operations.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks` which reflects the number of successful operations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list, an integer `k` representing a target value, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns `sunks`, which is the count of successful operations performed based on the given inputs.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `sunks` which reflects the number of successful operations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
