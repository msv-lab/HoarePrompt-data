Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). The current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`. The current value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`. The value of `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, and `a[l]` is equal to 0.**
