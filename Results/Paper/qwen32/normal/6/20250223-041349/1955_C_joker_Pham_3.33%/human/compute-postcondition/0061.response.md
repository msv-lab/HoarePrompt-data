Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). If `k` is 0, no change is made to the variables. If `k` >= `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
