Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 2`), the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, the current value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`, and the value of `a[l]` is now 0 if `a[l]` was originally 0. If `a[l]` was not 0, `a[l]` remains `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[l]` was 0, `sunks` has been incremented by 1 and `l` has been incremented by 1. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the conditions and values remain the same as described in the initial state.
