The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables or the conditions that control the loop. Therefore, the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0 minus `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each integer `a_i` (except `a[r]`) satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`) and `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` was 0, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables. `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
