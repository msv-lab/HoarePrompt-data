Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain the same, and the only change is that the program exits the loop or if statement.
