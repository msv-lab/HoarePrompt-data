Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. Additionally, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variables `l` and `r` are introduced with `l` set to 0 and `r` set to `n - 1`.
