Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is equal to or less than `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`), and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `sunks`. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is set to 1. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sunks` remains unchanged.**
