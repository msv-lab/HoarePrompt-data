The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0 minus `a[l] * 2`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` has been incremented by 1
- If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of
- Otherwise, the values of `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged
- `sunks` is incremented by 1

Since `continue` is used, the value of `sunks` remains the same for this iteration, and all other variables retain their values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0 minus `a[l] * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` has been incremented by 1; If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; Otherwise, the values of `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged; `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
