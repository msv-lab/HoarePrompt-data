Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. We exit the most internal loop or if statement.
