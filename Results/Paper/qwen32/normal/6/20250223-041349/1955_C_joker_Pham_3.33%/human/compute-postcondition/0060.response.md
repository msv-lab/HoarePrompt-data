Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`), `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the value of `sunks` is increased by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values.
