The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and each other integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `l` is incremented by 1.**
