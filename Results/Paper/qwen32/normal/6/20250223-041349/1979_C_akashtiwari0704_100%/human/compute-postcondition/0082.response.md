The code snippet provided modifies the value of `g` based on the current value of `g`, an element from the list `l` at index `i`, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The new value of `g` is calculated as `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by the code is `g`. The values of `l` and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is unchanged, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`**.
