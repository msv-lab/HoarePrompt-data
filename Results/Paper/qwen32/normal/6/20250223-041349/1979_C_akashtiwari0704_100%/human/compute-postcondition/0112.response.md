The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. The variable `i` is not changed in this snippet, but it is implied that it has been incremented previously as per the initial state. The value of `bets` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is updated to include `str(a[i]) + ' '` twice, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In natural language: `bets` remains greater than or equal to 1, `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i]` twice with a space in between, and `i` is incremented by 1.
