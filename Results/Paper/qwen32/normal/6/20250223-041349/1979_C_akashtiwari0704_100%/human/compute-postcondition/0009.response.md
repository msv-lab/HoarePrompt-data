To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the variable `g`. The loop iterates over the list `l` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is mentioned in the loop), and for each element `l[i]`, it updates `g` using the formula:

\[ g = g \times l[i] \div \text{gcd}(g, l[i]) \]

This formula effectively computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `g` and `l[i]`. The loop continues until all elements of `l` have been processed. Therefore, after the loop completes, `g` will be the least common multiple of all the elements in the list `l`.

Given the initial state, the final output state after all iterations will be:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `T` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
- `g` is updated to the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`.
- `i` is not a variable in the final state as it is a loop variable and does not persist after the loop ends.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes, `g` will hold the least common multiple of all the elements in the list `l`, while all other variables remain in their initial state except for `g`.
