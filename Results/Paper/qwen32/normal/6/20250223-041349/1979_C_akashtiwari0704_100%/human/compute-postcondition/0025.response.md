The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is `a[2]`, which is `prod // a[2]`. Therefore, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + a[2]`.

The original value of `sumo` is `a[0] + a[1]`. After the code execution, `sumo` becomes `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element has been updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of the original list `a`, `sumo` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `i` is 2, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`.**
