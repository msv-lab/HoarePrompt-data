The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`:

```
print(-1)
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or calculations defined in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Let's break down the initial state to ensure there are no dependencies affecting the `print(-1)` statement:

- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.
- `k` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20.
- `T` is 2.
- `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`.
- `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers as input by the user with the first `bets` elements modified to `prod // a[i]`.
- `prod` is the least common multiple of the list `a`.
- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
- `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each of the first `bets` elements of the modified `a` list separated by spaces.
- `l` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`.
- `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

None of these variables or conditions influence the `print(-1)` statement. The statement directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **-1**
