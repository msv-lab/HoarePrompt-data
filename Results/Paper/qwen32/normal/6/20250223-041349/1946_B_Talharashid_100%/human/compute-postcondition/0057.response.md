The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer obtained from the input (which is `n`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(l) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than `n`.

However, since `i` is `len(l) + 1` at the end of the last iteration, and the loop is defined to iterate up to `n`, it indicates that the loop has already completed all its iterations if `len(l) + 1` is not less than `n`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to a value less than `n`.

Since `i` is `len(l) + 1` at the end of the last iteration, we need to reduce `i` by 1 to make it `len(l)`, assuming `len(l)` is less than `n`. This way, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `i` is `len(l)`**
