Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is `len(l)`. The current element `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
