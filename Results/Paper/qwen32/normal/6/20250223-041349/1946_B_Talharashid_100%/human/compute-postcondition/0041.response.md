The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele`, which iterates over the list `l`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `ele` to the next element in the list `l`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer obtained from the input.
- `k` is the second integer obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not part of the loop head and thus not adjustable here).
- `ele` is an element of `l`.
- The conditions for updating `c` and `maxi` are based on the value of `ele`.

Since the loop iterates over `l`, at the start of the next iteration, `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`. No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

Let's denote the current value of `ele` as `l[j]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` was `l[j]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ele` should be `l[j+1]`, assuming `j+1` is a valid index in `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in `l`**.

Since the exact value of `ele` depends on its current position in the list, we can denote the new state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is `l[j+1]`**.

However, without knowing the exact current index `j`, we can generalize:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in `l`**.
