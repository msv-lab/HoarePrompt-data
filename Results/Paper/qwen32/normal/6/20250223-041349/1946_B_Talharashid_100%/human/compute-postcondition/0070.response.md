The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, which is the current element from the list `l`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `ele` to the next element in the list `l`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer obtained from the input
- `k` is the second integer obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `i` is `len(l)`, but `i` is not directly used in the loop head; it seems to be a mistake or an irrelevant detail in this context.
- `ele` is the current element being processed in the loop.
- `c` and `maxi` are affected by the value of `ele` but are not part of the loop head.

Since `i` is `len(l)`, it implies that `i` is the length of the list and not an index. The loop variable `ele` should be the next element in the list `l`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ele` should be the next element in the sequence.

Let's assume that the current iteration has just finished processing the element at index `j` (0-based index). The next element to be processed would be at index `j + 1`. Since we do not have the exact index `j` from the provided state, we can denote the next element as `l[j + 1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.

Since we don't have the exact index, we can't specify `ele` precisely, but we know it should be the next element in the list. If we assume the current `ele` was at index `j`, then the next `ele` would be `l[j + 1]`.

For a more concrete example, if the list `l` was `[5, -3, 8, -1]` and the current `ele` was `5` (at index 0), then the next `ele` would be `-3` (at index 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**

If we assume the current `ele` was the last element, then the loop would not execute again, but based on the given information, we assume there is at least one more element to process.

So the final state before the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`**
