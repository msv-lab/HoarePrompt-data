The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If there are more elements in `l`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ele` was the last processed element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `l` that has not yet been processed.

Let's assume that there is another element in `l` after `ele`. We'll call this new element `next_ele`. The state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` should remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in `l` (which is `next_ele`), `c` is updated based on the previous `ele`, `maxi` is updated based on the previous `ele` and `c`**.

Since we don't have specific values for `c` and `maxi` after the previous iteration, we'll just denote them as they are. The only change is that `ele` is now the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in `l`, `c` is updated based on the previous `ele`, `maxi` is updated based on the previous `ele` and `c`**.
