Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `ele` is the next element in the list `l`; `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`.**

In simple terms, the value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged.
