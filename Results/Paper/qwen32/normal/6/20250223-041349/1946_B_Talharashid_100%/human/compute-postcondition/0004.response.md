The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `maxi` to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c`) are not altered by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0; `maxi` is 0.**
