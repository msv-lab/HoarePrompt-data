The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged. The value of `c` remains the same as it was before the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in `l`, `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous value of `maxi` and `c`.**
