The code snippet `c += ele` increases the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged unless `c` is modified in a way that affects `maxi` as per the conditions described in the initial state. 

Since the code snippet only modifies `c`, we need to determine if this change affects `maxi`. The condition for updating `maxi` is that it should be the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `c`. Therefore, `maxi` will be updated to `c` if `c` becomes greater than the previous value of `maxi`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current one, `c` is increased by `ele`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`.**
