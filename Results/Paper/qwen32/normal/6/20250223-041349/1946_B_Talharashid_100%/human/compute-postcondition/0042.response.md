The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `ele`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
