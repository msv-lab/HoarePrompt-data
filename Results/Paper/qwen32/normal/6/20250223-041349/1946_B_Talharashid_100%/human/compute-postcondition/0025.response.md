To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze how the loop operates and what it does with the given variables.

### Understanding the Loop:
- The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `l`.
- If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` (cumulative sum) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` is reset to 0, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the current `maxi`.
- Otherwise, `c` is incremented by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the current `maxi`.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, `c` will be 0 if the last element processed was negative and `c` was less than or equal to the absolute value of that element, or it will be the sum of the last contiguous positive (or non-negative) numbers.
- `maxi` will hold the maximum cumulative sum encountered during the loop.

### Output State after all executions:
Given the loop processes all elements in `l`, the final state will be:
- `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is only iterated over.
- `c` will be 0 if the last condition resets it, otherwise it will be the sum of the last sequence of non-negative numbers.
- `maxi` will be the maximum cumulative sum encountered throughout the loop.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `c` will be 0 if the last element in the list was negative and `c` was less than or equal to the absolute value of that element. Otherwise, it will be the sum of the last sequence of non-negative numbers in the list.
- The variable `maxi` will contain the maximum cumulative sum of any contiguous subsequence of numbers encountered in the list.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer; k is an integer; l is a list of integers obtained from the input; c is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in l; maxi is the maximum cumulative sum of any contiguous subsequence in l.**
