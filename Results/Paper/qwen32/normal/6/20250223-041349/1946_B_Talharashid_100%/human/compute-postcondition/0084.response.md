To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the expression and understand the values of the variables involved based on the initial state provided.

### Breakdown of the Expression

The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007
```

#### Variables and Their Values:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output of this specific print statement.

2. **`n`**: The first integer obtained from the input. It represents the number of elements in the list `l`.

3. **`k`**: The second integer obtained from the input. It is used in the calculation of \(2^k\).

4. **`l`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. The sum of this list is used in the expression.

5. **`i`**: The length of the list `l`, which is `len(l)`. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output of this specific print statement.

6. **`c`**: The sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers before the last negative number that was large enough to reset `c` to 0. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output of this specific print statement.

7. **`maxi`**: The maximum value between the previous `maxi` and `c`. This variable is used in the calculation of `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`.

### Calculation of the Expression

1. **`2 ** k`**: This is 2 raised to the power of `k`.
2. **`2 ** k * maxi`**: This is the result of multiplying `2 ** k` by `maxi`.
3. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi`**: This is the result of subtracting `maxi` from `2 ** k * maxi`.
4. **`sum(l)`**: This is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
5. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)`**: This is the result of adding `sum(l)` to the previous result.
6. **`(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`**: This is the final result after taking the modulo of the previous result with 1000000007.

### Final Output

The final output will be the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is the second integer obtained from the input, maxi is the maximum value between the previous maxi and c, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
