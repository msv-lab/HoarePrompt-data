The code snippet provided is `mod_x_key = num % x`. However, there is no variable `num` defined in the initial state. Given the context, we can infer that `num` might be referring to `test_cases[0][3][0]` as it is used in the calculation of `mod_x` in the initial state. Let's assume `num` is indeed `test_cases[0][3][0]` for the purpose of this execution.

Given this assumption, `mod_x_key` will be calculated as `test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][1]`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_x` is `-test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][1]`; `mod_y` is `test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][2]`; `mod_x_key` is `test_cases[0][3][0] % test_cases[0][1]`.**
