To determine the final state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it updates the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - For each `num` in `arr`:
     - `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
     - `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
     - `count` is incremented by the sum of the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` corresponding to `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively.
     - `mod_x_map` is updated to increment the count of `mod_x_key` which is `num % x`.
     - `mod_y_map` is updated to increment the count of `mod_y_key` which is `num % y`.

3. **Final State:**
   - The loop runs for each element in `arr`, which means it will execute `n` times where `n` is the length of `arr`.
   - `count` will accumulate the sum of the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each `num` in `arr`.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will keep track of the frequency of each `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` respectively.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **`test_cases`**: This remains unchanged as it is the input list of tuples.
- **`results`**: This remains an empty list as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`count`**: This will be the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` that have been encountered previously in the loop.
- **`mod_x_map`**: This dictionary will map each `mod_x_key` (which is `num % x`) to the number of times it has occurred in `arr`.
- **`mod_y_map`**: This dictionary will map each `mod_y_key` (which is `num % y`) to the number of times it has occurred in `arr`.

### Final Output State:
- `test_cases` remains the input list of tuples.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `count` will be the sum of all the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for each element in `arr`.
- `mod_x_map` will contain the frequency of each `mod_x_key` in `arr`.
- `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each `mod_y_key` in `arr`.

### Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_x_key` in `arr`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_y_key` in `arr`.**
