The code snippet provided resets the `mod_x_map` dictionary to an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains n, x, y, and arr; `results` is a list containing the final value of count for the processed tuple; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_y_key and values as their respective counts for the processed tuple; The current tuple (n, x, y, arr) is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed.**
