### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program processes each test case by iterating through the array and using two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the count of elements that have a specific remainder when divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the input and parses it into a list of test cases, where each test case consists of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `count` to 0.
   - It uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to store the counts of elements based on their remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element `num` in the array:
     - It calculates `mod_x` as \(-num \% x\) and `mod_y` as `num \% y`.
     - It increments `count` by the number of elements previously encountered that have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y` values.
     - It updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's remainders.

3. **Calculating Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The key idea is to use the properties of modular arithmetic:
     - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), the remainders of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) when divided by \(x\) must satisfy \(a_i \% x + a_j \% x \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\). This can be rewritten using \(-a_j \% x\) as \(a_i \% x \equiv -a_j \% x \pmod{x}\).
     - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), the remainders of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) when divided by \(y\) must satisfy \(a_i \% y \equiv a_j \% y \pmod{y}\).
   - The program effectively counts the number of such pairs by leveraging the dictionaries to keep track of the remainders encountered so far.

4. **Output:** After processing all elements in the array for a given test case, it appends the `count` to the `results` list, which is then printed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The use of dictionaries to keep track of remainders ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
