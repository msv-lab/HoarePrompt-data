Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each processed tuple; `count` is the final computed value after processing all elements in `arr` for each tuple; `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that exist only within the scope of each iteration of the outer loop and are re-initialized for each tuple; `results` contains a count for each tuple processed, representing the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered for that specific tuple.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `test_cases` remains unchanged as a list of tuples. `results` is a list where each element is the `count` value computed for each corresponding tuple in `test_cases`. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are temporary dictionaries used within each iteration of the loop to keep track of the counts of remainders, and they do not persist after the loop completes processing a tuple.
