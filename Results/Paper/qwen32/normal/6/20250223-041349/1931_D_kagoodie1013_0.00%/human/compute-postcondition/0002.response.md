The provided Python code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The `test_cases` list and the `results` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `x` (1 <= x <= 10^9), `y` (1 <= y <= 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is 1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and `test_cases` must not be empty; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0.**
