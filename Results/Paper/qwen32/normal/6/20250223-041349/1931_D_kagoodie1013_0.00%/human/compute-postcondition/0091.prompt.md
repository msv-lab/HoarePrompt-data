Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). Specifically, 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in the list a. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_x_key` in `arr`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_y_key` in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains n, x, y, and arr; `results` is a list containing the final value of count; `count` is the total count as calculated by the loop; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_x_key and values as their respective counts; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_y_key and values as their respective counts; The current tuple (n, x, y, arr) is the tuple being processed, but the loop has finished iterating over arr; `results` now includes the final value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for the processed tuple plus the newly appended `count`; `count` is the final computed value after processing all elements in `arr`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with counts of each `mod_x_key` encountered in `arr`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with counts of each `mod_y_key` encountered in `arr`; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the processed tuple.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
