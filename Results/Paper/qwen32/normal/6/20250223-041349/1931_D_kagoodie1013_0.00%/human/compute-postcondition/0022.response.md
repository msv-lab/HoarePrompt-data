The code snippet calculates the value of `mod_x` using the formula `-num % x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is the next element in `arr`, and it is used in the calculation of `mod_x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 2; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**
