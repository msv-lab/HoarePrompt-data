Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `x` (1 <= x <= 10^9), `y` (1 <= y <= 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is 1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and `test_cases` must not be empty; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**

In this state, the variable `mod_x_map` has been initialized as an empty dictionary, while the other variables `test_cases`, `results`, and `count` remain unchanged.
